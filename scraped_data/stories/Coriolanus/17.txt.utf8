<ACTION>Enter the two Tribunes, Sicinius, and Brutus,with the Aedile.</ACTION> 

SICINIUS Bid them all home. He’s gone, and we’ll no further. The nobility are vexed, whom we see have sided In his behalf. 

BRUTUS Now we have shown our power, Let us seem humbler after it is done	 Than when it was a-doing. 

SICINIUS Bid them home. Say their great enemy is gone, and they Stand in their ancient strength. 

BRUTUS Dismiss them home.	 

<ACTION>Aedile exits.</ACTION> 

Here comes his mother. 

<ACTION>Enter Volumnia, Virgilia, and Menenius.</ACTION> 

SICINIUS Let’s not meet her. 

BRUTUS Why? 

SICINIUS They say she’s mad. 

BRUTUS 

They have ta’en note of us. Keep on your way.	 

VOLUMNIA O, you’re well met. The hoarded plague o’ th’ gods Requite your love! 

MENENIUS Peace, peace! Be not so loud. 

VOLUMNIA ,  <ACTION>to the Tribunes</ACTION> If that I could for weeping, you should hear— Nay, and you shall hear some.  <ACTION>(To Sicinius.) </ACTION> Will	 you be gone? 

VIRGILIA , <ACTION> to Brutus</ACTION> You shall stay too. I would I had the power To say so to my husband. 

SICINIUS ,  <ACTION>to Volumnia </ACTION> Are you mankind? 

VOLUMNIA Ay, fool, is that a shame? Note but this, fool.	 Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship To banish him that struck more blows for Rome Than thou hast spoken words? 

SICINIUS O blessèd heavens! 

VOLUMNIA More noble blows than ever thou wise words,	 And for Rome’s good. I’ll tell thee what—yet go. Nay, but thou shalt stay too. I would my son Were in Arabia and thy tribe before him, His good sword in his hand. 

SICINIUS What then?	 

VIRGILIA What then? He’d make an end of thy posterity. 

VOLUMNIA Bastards and all. Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome! 

MENENIUS Come, come, peace.	 

SICINIUS I would he had continued to his country As he began, and not unknit himself The noble knot he made. 

BRUTUS I would he had. 

VOLUMNIA “I would he had”? ’Twas you incensed the rabble.	 Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth As I can of those mysteries which heaven Will not have Earth to know. 

BRUTUS , to Sicinius  Pray, let’s go. 

VOLUMNIA Now, pray, sir, get you gone.	 You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this: As far as doth the Capitol exceed The meanest house in Rome, so far my son— This lady’s husband here, this, do you see?— Whom you have banished, does exceed you all.	 

BRUTUS Well, well, we’ll leave you. 

SICINIUS Why stay we to be baited With one that wants her wits?	 <ACTION>Tribunes exit.</ACTION> 

VOLUMNIA Take my prayers with you.		 I would the gods had nothing else to do But to confirm my curses. Could I meet ’em But once a day, it would unclog my heart Of what lies heavy to ’t. 

MENENIUS You have told them home,	 And, by my troth, you have cause. You’ll sup with me? 

VOLUMNIA Anger’s my meat. I sup upon myself And so shall starve with feeding. <ACTION>(To Virgilia.) </ACTION> Come, let’s go.	 Leave this faint puling, and lament as I do, In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.	 <ACTION>They exit.</ACTION> 

MENENIUS Fie, fie, fie! 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
