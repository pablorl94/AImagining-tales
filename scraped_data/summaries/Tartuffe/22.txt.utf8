Tartuffe comes in, ready to go. Everything is clear. He does not see Orgon.

Orgon comes out, guns blazing. Well, not literally. He starts chewing Tartuffe out, and claims to have "long suspected" him (4.7.2). It seems Tartuffe doesn't have a monopoly on lying.

When Orgon tells Tartuffe to hit the road, Tartuffe turns the tables. Before running he declares, "This house belongs to me, I'll have you know."
