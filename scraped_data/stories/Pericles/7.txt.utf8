<ACTION>Enter King Simonides, with Lords, Attendants,and Thaisa.</ACTION> 

SIMONIDES Are the knights ready to begin the triumph? 

FIRST LORD They are, my liege, And stay your coming to present themselves. 

SIMONIDES Return them we are ready, and our daughter here, In honor of whose birth these triumphs are,	 Sits here like Beauty’s child, whom Nature gat For men to see and, seeing, wonder at. 

<ACTION>An Attendant exits.</ACTION> 

THAISA It pleaseth you, my royal father, to express My commendations great, whose merit’s less. 

SIMONIDES It’s fit it should be so, for princes are	 A model which heaven makes like to itself. As jewels lose their glory if neglected, So princes their renowns if not respected. ’Tis now your honor, daughter, to entertain The labor of each knight in his device.	 

THAISA Which to preserve mine honor, I’ll perform. 

<ACTION>The first Knight passes by. His Squire presents a shieldto Thaisa.</ACTION> 

SIMONIDES Who is the first that doth prefer himself? 

THAISA A knight of Sparta, my renownèd father, And the device he bears upon his shield Is a black Ethiop reaching at the sun;	 The word: Lux tua vita mihi. 

SIMONIDES He loves you well that holds his life of you. 

<ACTION>The second Knight passes by. His Squire presents ashield to Thaisa.</ACTION> 

Who is the second that presents himself? 

THAISA A prince of Macedon, my royal father, And the device he bears upon his shield Is an armed knight that’s conquered by a lady. The motto thus, in Spanish: Pue per doleera kee per forsa. 

<ACTION>The third Knight passes by. His Squire presents a shieldto Thaisa.</ACTION> 

SIMONIDES And what’s the third? 

THAISA The third, of Antioch;	 And his device a wreath of chivalry; The word: Me pompae provexit apex. 

<ACTION>The fourth Knight passes by. His Squire presents ashield to Thaisa.</ACTION> 

SIMONIDES What is the fourth? 

THAISA A burning torch that’s turnèd upside down; The word: Qui me alit me extinguit.	 

SIMONIDES Which shows that beauty hath his power and will, Which can as well inflame as it can kill. 

<ACTION>The fifth Knight passes by. His Squire presents a shieldto Thaisa.</ACTION> 

THAISA The fifth, an hand environèd with clouds, Holding out gold that’s by the touchstone tried; The motto thus: Sic spectanda fides.	 

<ACTION>The sixth Knight, Pericles, passes by. He presents ashield to Thaisa.</ACTION> 

SIMONIDES And what’s the sixth and last, the which the knight himself With such a graceful courtesy delivered? 

THAISA He seems to be a stranger; but his present is A withered branch that’s only green at top,	 The motto: In hac spe vivo. 

SIMONIDES A pretty moral. From the dejected state wherein he is, He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish. 

FIRST LORD He had need mean better than his outward show	 Can any way speak in his just commend, For by his rusty outside he appears To have practiced more the whipstock than the lance. 

SECOND LORD He well may be a stranger, for he comes To an honored triumph strangely furnishèd.	 

THIRD LORD And on set purpose let his armor rust Until this day, to scour it in the dust. 

SIMONIDES Opinion’s but a fool that makes us scan The outward habit by the inward man. But stay, the knights are coming.	 We will withdraw into the gallery. <ACTION>They exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Great shouts offstage, and all cry, “The mean knight.”</ACTION>
