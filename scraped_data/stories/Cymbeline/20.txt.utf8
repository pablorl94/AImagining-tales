<ACTION>Enter Belarius as Morgan, Guiderius as Polydor,Arviragus as Cadwal, and Imogen as Fidele, from thecave.</ACTION> 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan, to Fidele</ACTION> You are not well. Remain here in the cave. We’ll come to you after hunting. 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal, to Fidele</ACTION> Brother, stay here. Are we not brothers? 

IMOGEN ,  <ACTION>as Fidele </ACTION> So man and man should be,	 But clay and clay differs in dignity, Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor, to Morgan and Cadwal</ACTION> Go you to hunting. I’ll abide with him. 

IMOGEN ,  <ACTION>as Fidele</ACTION> So sick I am not, yet I am not well; But not so citizen a wanton as	 To seem to die ere sick. So please you, leave me. Stick to your journal course. The breach of custom Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me Cannot amend me. Society is no comfort To one not sociable. I am not very sick,	 Since I can reason of it. Pray you trust me here— I’ll rob none but myself—and let me die, Stealing so poorly. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> I love thee—I have spoke it— How much the quantity, the weight as much	 As I do love my father. 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> What? How, how? 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> If it be sin to say so, sir, I yoke me In my good brother’s fault. I know not why I love this youth, and I have heard you say	 Love’s reason’s without reason. The bier at door, And a demand who is ’t shall die, I’d say “My father, not this youth.” 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> O, noble strain! O, worthiness of nature, breed of greatness!	 Cowards father cowards and base things sire base; Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace. I’m not their father, yet who this should be Doth miracle itself, loved before me.— ’Tis the ninth hour o’ th’ morn.	 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal, to Fidele</ACTION> Brother, farewell. 

IMOGEN ,  <ACTION>as Fidele</ACTION> I wish you sport. 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal </ACTION> You health.—So please you, sir. 

IMOGEN ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> These are kind creatures. Gods, what lies I have heard! Our courtiers say all’s savage but at court;	 Experience, O, thou disprov’st report! Th’ imperious seas breeds monsters; for the dish Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish. I am sick still, heart-sick. Pisanio, I’ll now taste of thy drug.	 <ACTION>She swallows the drug.</ACTION> 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor, to Morgan and Cadwal</ACTION> I could not stir him. He said he was gentle but unfortunate, Dishonestly afflicted but yet honest. 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> Thus did he answer me, yet said hereafter I might know more. 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> To th’ field, to th’ field! <ACTION>To Fidele</ACTION> . We’ll leave you for this time. Go in and rest. 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> We’ll not be long away. 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> Pray, be not sick,	 For you must be our huswife. 

IMOGEN ,  <ACTION>as Fidele </ACTION> Well or ill, I am bound to you. 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> And shalt be ever. 

<ACTION>Imogen exits as into the cave.</ACTION> 

This youth, howe’er distressed, appears he hath had	 Good ancestors. 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> How angel-like he sings! 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> But his neat cookery! He cut our roots in characters And sauced our broths as Juno had been sick And he her dieter.	 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> Nobly he yokes A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh Was that it was for not being such a smile, The smile mocking the sigh that it would fly From so divine a temple to commix	 With winds that sailors rail at. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> I do note That grief and patience, rooted in them both, Mingle their spurs together. 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> Grow, patience,	 And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine His perishing root with the increasing vine! 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> It is great morning. Come, away. Who’s there? 

<ACTION>Enter Cloten.</ACTION> 

CLOTEN ,  <ACTION>to himself</ACTION> I cannot find those runagates. That villain Hath mocked me. I am faint.	 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan, to Polydor and Cadwal</ACTION> “Those runagates”? Means he not us? I partly know him. ’Tis Cloten, the son o’ th’ Queen. I fear some ambush. I saw him not these many years, and yet I know ’tis he. We are held as outlaws. Hence. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> He is but one. You and my brother search What companies are near. Pray you, away. Let me alone with him.	 <ACTION>Belarius and Arviragus exit.</ACTION> 

CLOTEN  Soft, what are you That fly me thus? Some villain mountaineers?	 I have heard of such.—What slave art thou? 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> A thing More slavish did I ne’er than answering A slave without a knock. 

CLOTEN Thou art a robber, A lawbreaker, a villain. Yield thee, thief. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> To who? To thee? What art thou? Have not I An arm as big as thine? A heart as big? Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,	 Why I should yield to thee. 

CLOTEN  Thou villain base, Know’st me not by my clothes? 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> No, nor thy tailor, rascal.	 Who is thy grandfather? He made those clothes, Which, as it seems, make thee. 

CLOTEN  Thou precious varlet, My tailor made them not. 

GUIDERIUS , <ACTION> as Polydor  </ACTION> Hence then, and thank	 The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool. I am loath to beat thee. 

CLOTEN Thou injurious thief, Hear but my name, and tremble. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> What’s thy name?	 

CLOTEN Cloten, thou villain. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name, I cannot tremble at it. Were it Toad, or Adder, Spider, ’Twould move me sooner. 

CLOTEN  To thy further fear,	 Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know I am son to th’ Queen. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> I am sorry for ’t, not seeming So worthy as thy birth. 

CLOTEN Art not afeard?	 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> Those that I reverence, those I fear—the wise; At fools I laugh, not fear them. 

CLOTEN Die the death! When I have slain thee with my proper hand, I’ll follow those that even now fled hence	 And on the gates of Lud’s Town set your heads. Yield, rustic mountaineer! 

<ACTION>They fight and exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Belarius as Morgan and Arviragus asCadwal.</ACTION> 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan </ACTION> No company’s abroad? 

ARVIRAGUS , <ACTION> as Cadwal</ACTION> None in the world. You did mistake him sure. 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> I cannot tell. Long is it since I saw him,	 But time hath nothing blurred those lines of favor Which then he wore. The snatches in his voice And burst of speaking were as his. I am absolute ’Twas very Cloten. 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> In this place we left them.	 I wish my brother make good time with him, You say he is so fell. 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> Being scarce made up, I mean to man, he had not apprehension Of roaring terrors; for defect of judgment	 Is oft the cause of fear. 

<ACTION>Enter Guiderius as Polydor, carrying Cloten’s head.</ACTION> 

But see, thy brother. 

But see, thy brother. 

GUIDERIUS, <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse; There was no money in ’t. Not Hercules Could have knocked out his brains, for he had none.	 Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne My head as I do his. 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan  </ACTION> What hast thou done? 

GUIDERIUS, <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten’s head, Son to the Queen, after his own report,	 Who called me traitor mountaineer, and swore With his own single hand he’d take us in, Displace our heads where, thank the gods, they grow, And set them on Lud’s Town.	 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> We are all undone. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> Why, worthy father, what have we to lose But that he swore to take, our lives? The law Protects not us. Then why should we be tender To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,	 Play judge and executioner all himself, For we do fear the law? What company Discover you abroad? 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> No single soul Can we set eye on, but in all safe reason	 He must have some attendants. Though his humor Was nothing but mutation—ay, and that From one bad thing to worse—not frenzy, Not absolute madness could so far have raved To bring him here alone. Although perhaps	 It may be heard at court that such as we Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time May make some stronger head, the which he hearing— As it is like him—might break out and swear	 He’d fetch us in, yet is ’t not probable To come alone, either he so undertaking Or they so suffering. Then on good ground we fear, If we do fear this body hath a tail More perilous than the head.	 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> Let ord’nance Come as the gods foresay it. Howsoe’er, My brother hath done well. 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> I had no mind To hunt this day. The boy Fidele’s sickness	 Did make my way long forth. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> With his own sword, Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta’en His head from him. I’ll throw ’t into the creek Behind our rock, and let it to the sea	 And tell the fishes he’s the Queen’s son, Cloten. That’s all I reck.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> I fear ’twill be revenged. Would, Polydor, thou hadst not done ’t, though valor Becomes thee well enough.	 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> Would I had done ’t, So the revenge alone pursued me. Polydor, I love thee brotherly, but envy much Thou hast robbed me of this deed. I would revenges That possible strength might meet would seek us	 through And put us to our answer. 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> Well, ’tis done. We’ll hunt no more today, nor seek for danger Where there’s no profit. I prithee, to our rock.	 You and Fidele play the cooks. I’ll stay Till hasty Polydor return, and bring him To dinner presently. 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> Poor sick Fidele. I’ll willingly to him. To gain his color	 I’d let a parish of such Clotens blood, And praise myself for charity.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

BELARIUS O thou goddess, Thou divine Nature, thou thyself thou blazon’st In these two princely boys! They are as gentle	 As zephyrs blowing below the violet, Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough, Their royal blood enchafed, as the rud’st wind That by the top doth take the mountain pine And make him stoop to th’ vale. ’Tis wonder	 That an invisible instinct should frame them To royalty unlearned, honor untaught, Civility not seen from other, valor That wildly grows in them but yields a crop As if it had been sowed. Yet still it’s strange	 What Cloten’s being here to us portends, Or what his death will bring us. 

<ACTION>Enter Guiderius as Polydor.</ACTION> 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor  </ACTION> Where’s my brother? I have sent Cloten’s clotpole down the stream In embassy to his mother. His body’s hostage	 For his return.	Solemn music. 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan </ACTION> My ingenious instrument! Hark, Polydor, it sounds! But what occasion Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> Is he at home?	 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> He went hence even now. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> What does he mean? Since death of my dear’st mother It did not speak before. All solemn things Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?	 Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys Is jollity for apes and grief for boys. Is Cadwal mad? 

<ACTION>Enter Arviragus as Cadwal, with Imogen as dead,bearing her in his arms.</ACTION> 

BELARIUS <ACTION>, as Morgan </ACTION> Look, here he comes, And brings the dire occasion in his arms	 Of what we blame him for. 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> The bird is dead That we have made so much on. I had rather Have skipped from sixteen years of age to sixty, To have turned my leaping time into a crutch,	 Than have seen this. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor </ACTION> O sweetest, fairest lily! My brother wears thee not the one half so well As when thou grew’st thyself. 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> O melancholy,	 Whoever yet could sound thy bottom, find The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare Might eas’liest harbor in?—Thou blessèd thing, Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I, Thou died’st, a most rare boy, of melancholy.—	 How found you him? 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal </ACTION> Stark, as you see; Thus smiling, as some fly had tickled slumber, Not as Death’s dart being laughed at; his right cheek Reposing on a cushion.	 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor </ACTION> Where? 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> O’ th’ floor, His arms thus leagued. I thought he slept, and put My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness Answered my steps too loud.	 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> Why, he but sleeps. If he be gone, he’ll make his grave a bed; With female fairies will his tomb be haunted— And worms will not come to thee. 

ARVIRAGUS , <ACTION> as Cadwal</ACTION> With fairest flowers,	 Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele, I’ll sweeten thy sad grave. Thou shalt not lack The flower that’s like thy face, pale primrose; nor The azured harebell, like thy veins; no, nor The leaf of eglantine whom, not to slander,	 Out-sweetened not thy breath. The ruddock would With charitable bill—O bill, sore shaming Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie Without a monument—bring thee all this, Yea, and furred moss besides, when flowers are none To winter-ground thy corse. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> Prithee, have done, And do not play in wench-like words with that Which is so serious. Let us bury him And not protract with admiration what	 Is now due debt. To th’ grave. 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> Say, where shall ’s lay him? 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> By good Euriphile, our mother. 

ARVIRAGUS, <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> Be ’t so.	 And let us, Polydor, though now our voices Have got the mannish crack, sing him to th’ ground As once to our mother; use like note and words, Save that “Euriphile” must be “Fidele.” 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor  </ACTION> Cadwal,	 I cannot sing. I’ll weep, and word it with thee, For notes of sorrow, out of tune, are worse Than priests and fanes that lie. 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal  </ACTION> We’ll speak it then. 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> Great griefs, I see, med’cine the less, for Cloten	 Is quite forgot. He was a queen’s son, boys, And though he came our enemy, remember He was paid for that. Though mean and mighty, Rotting together, have one dust, yet reverence, That angel of the world, doth make distinction	 Of place ’tween high and low. Our foe was princely, And though you took his life as being our foe, Yet bury him as a prince. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor, to Morgan</ACTION> Pray you fetch him hither.	 Thersites’ body is as good as Ajax’ When neither are alive. 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal, to Morgan</ACTION> If you’ll go fetch him, We’ll say our song the whilst.—Brother, begin.	 

<ACTION>Belarius exits.</ACTION> 

GUIDERIUS , as  <ACTION>Polydor</ACTION> Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to th’ east; My father hath a reason for ’t. 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> ’Tis true. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> Come on then, and remove him. 

<ACTION>They move Imogen’s body.</ACTION> 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> So, begin.	 

<ACTION>Song.</ACTION> 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> Fear no more the heat o’ th’ sun, Nor the furious winter’s rages; Thou thy worldly task hast done, Home art gone and ta’en thy wages. Golden lads and girls all must,	 As chimney-sweepers, come to dust. 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> Fear no more the frown o’ th’ great; Thou art past the tyrant’s stroke. Care no more to clothe and eat; To thee the reed is as the oak.	 The scepter, learning, physic must All follow this and come to dust. 

GUIDERIUS , <ACTION> as Polydor</ACTION> Fear no more the lightning flash. 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> Nor th’ all-dreaded thunderstone. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> Fear not slander, censure rash;	 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> Thou hast finished joy and moan. 

BOTH	 All lovers young, all lovers must Consign to thee and come to dust. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> No exorciser harm thee, 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> Nor no witchcraft charm thee.	 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> Ghost unlaid forbear thee. 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> Nothing ill come near thee. 

BOTH Quiet consummation have, And renownèd be thy grave. 

<ACTION>Enter Belarius as Morgan, with the body of Cloten.</ACTION> 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> We have done our obsequies. Come, lay him down.	 

<ACTION>Cloten’s body is placed by Imogen’s.</ACTION> 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> Here’s a few flowers, but ’bout midnight more. The herbs that have on them cold dew o’ th’ night Are strewings fitt’st for graves. Upon their faces.— You were as flowers, now withered. Even so These herblets shall, which we upon you strew.—	 Come on, away; apart upon our knees. The ground that gave them first has them again. Their pleasures here are past; so is their pain. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION> 

IMOGEN Yes, sir, to Milford Haven. Which is the way? I thank you. By yond bush? Pray, how far thither?	 Ods pittikins, can it be six mile yet? I have gone all night. Faith, I’ll lie down and sleep. 

<ACTION>She sees Cloten’s headless body.</ACTION> 

But soft! No bedfellow? O gods and goddesses! These flowers are like the pleasures of the world, This bloody man the care on ’t. I hope I dream,	 For so I thought I was a cave-keeper And cook to honest creatures. But ’tis not so. ’Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing, Which the brain makes of fumes. Our very eyes Are sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,	 I tremble still with fear; but if there be Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity As a wren’s eye, feared gods, a part of it! The dream’s here still. Even when I wake it is Without me as within me, not imagined, felt. A headless man? The garments of Posthumus? I know the shape of ’s leg. This is his hand, His foot Mercurial, his Martial thigh, The brawns of Hercules; but his Jovial face— Murder in heaven! How? ’Tis gone. Pisanio,	 All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks, And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou, Conspired with that irregulous devil Cloten, Hath here cut off my lord. To write and read Be henceforth treacherous. 

Damned Pisanio	 Hath with his forgèd letters—damned Pisanio— From this most bravest vessel of the world Struck the maintop.O Posthumus, alas, Where is thy head? Where’s that? Ay me, where’s that? Pisanio might have killed thee at the heart	 And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio? ’Tis he and Cloten. Malice and lucre in them Have laid this woe here. O, ’tis pregnant, pregnant! The drug he gave me, which he said was precious And cordial to me, have I not found it	 Murd’rous to th’ senses? That confirms it home. This is Pisanio’s deed, and Cloten. O, Give color to my pale cheek with thy blood, That we the horrider may seem to those Which chance to find us. O my lord! My lord! 

<ACTION>Enter Lucius, Captains, Soldiers, and a Soothsayer.</ACTION> 

CAPTAIN To them the legions garrisoned in Gallia, After your will, have crossed the sea, attending You here at Milford Haven with your ships. They are here in readiness. 

LUCIUS  But what from Rome?	 

CAPTAIN The Senate hath stirred up the confiners And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits That promise noble service, and they come Under the conduct of bold Iachimo, Siena’s brother.	 

LUCIUS When expect you them? 

CAPTAIN With the next benefit o’ th’ wind. 

LUCIUS  This forwardness Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers Be mustered; bid the Captains look to ’t.—Now, sir,	 What have you dreamed of late of this war’s purpose? 

SOOTHSAYER Last night the very gods showed me a vision— I fast and prayed for their intelligence—thus: I saw Jove’s bird, the Roman eagle, winged From the spongy south to this part of the west,	 There vanished in the sunbeams, which portends— Unless my sins abuse my divination— Success to th’ Roman host. 

LUCIUS Dream often so, And never false.—Soft, ho, what trunk is here	 Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime It was a worthy building. How, a page? Or dead or sleeping on him? But dead rather, For nature doth abhor to make his bed With the defunct or sleep upon the dead.	 Let’s see the boy’s face. 

CAPTAIN He’s alive, my lord. 

LUCIUS He’ll then instruct us of this body.—Young one, Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems They crave to be demanded. Who is this	 Thou mak’st thy bloody pillow? Or who was he That, otherwise than noble nature did, Hath altered that good picture? What’s thy interest In this sad wrack? How came ’t? Who is ’t? What art thou?	 

IMOGEN ,  <ACTION>as Fidele</ACTION> I am nothing; or if not, Nothing to be were better. This was my master, A very valiant Briton, and a good, That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas, There is no more such masters. I may wander	 From east to occident, cry out for service, Try many, all good, serve truly, never Find such another master. 

LUCIUS ’Lack, good youth, Thou mov’st no less with thy complaining than	 Thy master in bleeding. Say his name, good friend. 

IMOGEN ,  <ACTION>as Fidele</ACTION> Richard du Champ. Aside. If I do lie and do No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope They’ll pardon it.—Say you, sir? 

LUCIUS Thy name?	 

IMOGEN ,  <ACTION>as Fidele </ACTION> Fidele, sir. 

LUCIUS Thou dost approve thyself the very same; Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name. Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say Thou shalt be so well mastered, but be sure	 No less beloved. The Roman Emperor’s letters Sent by a consul to me should not sooner Than thine own worth prefer thee. Go with me. 

IMOGEN, <ACTION>as Fidele</ACTION> I’ll follow, sir. But first, an ’t please the gods, I’ll hide my master from the flies as deep	 As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when With wild-wood leaves and weeds I ha’ strewed his grave And on it said a century of prayers, Such as I can, twice o’er, I’ll weep and sigh,	 And leaving so his service, follow you, So please you entertain me. 

LUCIUS Ay, good youth, And rather father thee than master thee.—My friends, The boy hath taught us manly duties. Let us	 Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can, And make him with our pikes and partisans A grave. Come, arm him.—Boy, he’s preferred By thee to us, and he shall be interred As soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes.	 Some falls are means the happier to arise. 

<ACTION>They exit, the Soldiers carrying Cloten’s body.</ACTION>
