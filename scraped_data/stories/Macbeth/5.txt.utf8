<ACTION>Hautboys and Torches. Enter King Duncan, Malcolm,Donalbain, Banquo, Lennox, Macduff, Ross, Angus, andAttendants.</ACTION> 

DUNCAN This castle hath a pleasant seat. The air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses. 

BANQUO This guest of summer, The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,	 By his loved mansionry, that the heaven’s breath Smells wooingly here. No jutty, frieze, Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle. Where they most breed and haunt, I have	 observed, The air is delicate. 

<ACTION>Enter Lady Macbeth.</ACTION> 

DUNCAN See, see our honored hostess!— The love that follows us sometime is our trouble, Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you	 How you shall bid God ’ild us for your pains And thank us for your trouble. 

LADY MACBETH  All our service, In every point twice done and then done double, Were poor and single business to contend	 Against those honors deep and broad wherewith Your Majesty loads our house. For those of old, And the late dignities heaped up to them, We rest your hermits. 

DUNCAN Where’s the Thane of Cawdor?	 We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose To be his purveyor; but he rides well, And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath helped him To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,	 We are your guest tonight. 

LADY MACBETH Your servants ever Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs in compt To make their audit at your Highness’ pleasure, Still to return your own.	 

DUNCAN Give me your hand. 

<ACTION>Taking her hand.</ACTION> Conduct me to mine host. We love him highly And shall continue our graces towards him. By your leave, hostess. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
