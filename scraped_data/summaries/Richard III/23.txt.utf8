As Richard is throwing around his weight, Richmond enters the scene on another part of the stage. (This is a theatrical device for indicating two faraway places â€“ in this case, the two rival camps.)

Richmond is also making battle preparations, but rather than rely on the weakness of his enemy (as Richard does), he constructs a careful battle plan. He calls for pen and ink so he can draft all the battle movements and asks that some of his men stay to advise him.

Also in contrast to Richard, Richmond distributes the command among several leaders of regiments.

Richmond's even having one of the earls come to visit him at 2am to talk shop and go over the plan.

Finally, Richmond asks Captain Blunt to find his stepfather Lord Stanley, who is half a mile from Richard's own camp and still pretending to be on Richard's side. Richmond gives Blunt a letter to deliver to Stanley before steeping himself in the battle plans and preparations.
