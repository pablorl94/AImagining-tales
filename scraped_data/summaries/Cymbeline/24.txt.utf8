Lucius, Iachimo, and the Roman army enter on one side of the stage; the British army enters on the other. Posthumus follows.

Iachimo loses his sword to Posthumus (in disguise) and feels guilty about pretending to hook up with Posthumus's girl.

After Posthumus has left, Iachimo says he feels bad for slandering Imogen's good name. He figures that he is like all Romans—mere mortals—unlike British, who men are gods.

The battle rages on, and Cymbeline is overtaken.

It's Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus to the rescue. The three men rescue Cymbeline. Then Posthumus enters along with more British peeps.

Lucius realizes he and the Romans are defeated.
