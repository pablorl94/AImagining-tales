In morning time, when the dawn breaks at last, Awakened is that Emperour Charles. Saint Gabriel, who on God's part him guards, Raises his hand, the Sign upon him marks. Rises the King, his arms aside he's cast, The others then, through all the host, disarm. After they mount, by virtue canter fast Through those long ways, and through those roads so large; They go to see the marvellous damage In Rencesvals, there where the battle was. AOI. 

CCIV 

In Rencesvals is Charles entered, Begins to weep for those he finds there dead; Says to the Franks:  "My lords, restrain your steps, Since I myself alone should go ahead, For my nephew, whom I would find again. At Aix I was, upon the feast Noel, Vaunted them there my valiant chevaliers, Of battles great and very hot contests; With reason thus I heard Rollant speak then: He would not die in any foreign realm Ere he'd surpassed his peers and all his men. To the foes' land he would have turned his head, Conqueringly his gallant life he'ld end." Further than one a little wand could send, Before the rest he's on a peak mounted. 

CCV 

When the Emperour went seeking his nephew, He found the grass, and every flower that bloomed, Turned scarlat, with our barons' blood imbrued; Pity he felt, he could but weep for rue. Beneath two trees he climbed the hill and looked, And Rollant's strokes on three terraces knew, On the green grass saw lying his nephew; `Tis nothing strange that Charles anger grew. Dismounted then, and went--his heart was full, In his two hands the count's body he took; With anguish keen he fell on him and swooned. 

CCVI 

That Emperour is from his swoon revived. Naimes the Duke, and the count Aceline, Gefrei d'Anjou and his brother Tierry, Take up the King, bear him beneath a pine. There on the ground he sees his nephew lie. Most sweetly then begins he to repine: "Rollant, my friend, may God to thee be kind! Never beheld any man such a knight So to engage and so to end a fight. Now my honour is turned into decline!" Charle swoons again, he cannot stand upright. AOI. 

CCVII 

Charles the King returned out of his swoon. Him in their hands four of his barons took, He looked to the earth, saw lying his nephew; All colourless his lusty body grew, He turned his eyes, were very shadowful. Charles complained in amity and truth: "Rollant, my friend, God lay thee mid the blooms Of Paradise, among the glorious! Thou cam'st to Spain in evil tide, seigneur! Day shall not dawn, for thee I've no dolour. How perishes my strength and my valour! None shall I have now to sustain my honour; I think I've not one friend neath heaven's roof, Kinsmen I have, but none of them's so proof." He tore his locks, till both his hands were full. Five score thousand Franks had such great dolour There was not one but sorely wept for rue. AOI. 

CCVIII 

"Rollant, my friend, to France I will away; When at Loum, I'm in my hall again, Strange men will come from many far domains, Who'll ask me, where's that count, the Capitain; I'll say to them that he is dead in Spain. In bitter grief henceforward shall I reign, Day shall not dawn, I weep not nor complain. 

CCIX 

"Rollant, my friend, fair youth that bar'st the bell, When I arrive at Aix, in my Chapelle, Men coming there will ask what news I tell; I'll say to them: `Marvellous news and fell. My nephew's dead, who won for me such realms!' Against me then the Saxon will rebel, Hungar, Bulgar, and many hostile men, Romain, Puillain, all those are in Palerne, And in Affrike, and those in Califerne; Afresh then will my pain and suffrance swell. For who will lead my armies with such strength, When he is slain, that all our days us led? Ah!  France the Douce, now art thou deserted! Such grief I have that I would fain be dead." All his white beard he hath begun to rend, Tore with both hands the hair out of his head. Five score thousand Franks swooned on the earth and fell. 

CCX 

"Rollant, my friend, God shew thee His mercy! In Paradise repose the soul of thee! Who hath thee slain, exile for France decreed. I'ld live no more, so bitter is my grief For my household, who have been slain for me. God grant me this, the Son of Saint Mary, Ere I am come to th' master-pass of Size, From my body my soul at length go free! Among their souls let mine in glory be, And let my flesh upon their flesh be heaped." Still his white beard he tears, and his eyes weep. Duke Naimes says: "His wrath is great indeed." AOI. 

CCXI 

"Sire, Emperour," Gefrei d'Anjou implored, "Let not your grief to such excess be wrought; Bid that our men through all this field be sought, Whom those of Spain have in the battle caught; In a charnel command that they be borne." Answered the King: "Sound then upon your horn." AOI. 

CCXII 

Gefreid d'Anjou upon his trumpet sounds; As Charles bade them, all the Franks dismount. All of their friends, whose bodies they have found To a charnel speedily the bring down. Bishops there are, and abbots there enow, Canons and monks, vicars with shaven crowns; Absolution in God's name they've pronounced; Incense and myrrh with precious gums they've ground, And lustily they've swung the censers round; With honour great they've laid them in the ground. They've left them there; what else might they do now? AOI. 

CCXIII 

That Emperour sets Rollant on one side And Oliver, and the Archbishop Turpine; Their bodies bids open before his eyes. And all their hearts in silken veils to wind, And set them in coffers of marble white; After, they take the bodies of those knights, Each of the three is wrapped in a deer's hide; They're washen well in allspice and in wine. The King commands Tedbalt and Gebuin, Marquis Otun, Milun the count besides: Along the road in three wagons to drive. They're covered well with carpets Galazine. AOI. 

CCXIV 

Now to be off would that Emperour Charles, When pagans, lo! comes surging the vanguard; Two messengers come from their ranks forward, From the admiral bring challenge to combat: "'Tis not yet time, proud King, that thou de-part. Lo, Baligant comes cantering afterward, Great are the hosts he leads from Arab parts; This day we'll see if thou hast vassalage." Charles the King his snowy beard has clasped, Remembering his sorrow and damage, Haughtily then his people all regards, In a loud voice he cries with all his heart: "Barons and Franks, to horse, I say, to arms!" AOI. 

CCXC 

First before all was armed that Emperour, Nimbly enough his iron sark indued, Laced up his helm, girt on his sword Joiuse, Outshone the sun that dazzling light it threw, Hung from his neck a shield, was of Girunde, And took his spear, was fashioned at Blandune. On his good horse then mounted, Tencendur, Which he had won at th'ford below Marsune When he flung dead Malpalin of Nerbune, Let go the reins, spurred him with either foot; Five score thousand behind him as he flew, Calling on God and the Apostle of Roum. AOI. 

CCXVI 

Through all the field dismount the Frankish men, Five-score thousand and more, they arm themselves; The gear they have enhances much their strength, Their horses swift, their arms are fashioned well; Mounted they are, and fight with great science. Find they that host, battle they'll render them. Their gonfalons flutter above their helms. When Charles sees the fair aspect of them, He calls to him Jozeran of Provence, Naimon the Duke, with Antelme of Maience: "In such vassals should man have confidence, Whom not to trust were surely want of sense; Unless the Arabs of coming here repent, Then Rollant's life, I think, we'll dearly sell." Answers Duke Neimes: "God grant us his consent!" AOI. 

CCXVII 

Charles hath called Rabel and Guineman; Thus said the King: "My lords, you I command To take their place, Olivier and Rollant, One bear the sword and the other the olifant; So canter forth ahead, before the van, And in your train take fifteen thousand Franks, Young bachelors, that are most valiant. As many more shall after them advance, Whom Gebuins shall lead, also Lorains." Naimes the Duke and the count Jozerans Go to adjust these columns in their ranks. Find they that host, they'll make a grand attack. AOI. 

CCXVIII 

Of Franks the first columns made ready there, After those two a third they next prepare; In it are set the vassals of Baiviere, Some thousand score high-prized chevaliers; Never was lost the battle, where they were: Charles for no race neath heaven hath more care, Save those of France, who realms for him conquered. The Danish chief, the warrior count Oger, Shall lead that troop, for haughty is their air. AOI. 

CCXIX 

Three columns now, he has, the Emperour Charles. Naimes the Duke a fourth next sets apart Of good barons, endowed with vassalage; Germans they are, come from the German March, A thousand score, as all said afterward; They're well equipped with horses and with arms, Rather they'll die than from the battle pass; They shall be led by Hermans, Duke of Trace, Who'll die before he's any way coward. AOI. 

CCXX 

Naimes the Duke and the count Jozerans The fifth column have mustered, of Normans, A thousand score, or so say all the Franks; Well armed are they, their horses charge and prance; Rather they'ld die, than eer be recreant; No race neath heav'n can more in th'field compass. Richard the old, lead them in th'field he shall, He'll strike hard there with his good trenchant lance. AOI. 

CCXXI 

The sixth column is mustered of Bretons; Thirty thousand chevaliers therein come; These canter in the manner of barons, Upright their spears, their ensigns fastened on. The overlord of them is named Oedon, Who doth command the county Nevelon, Tedbald of Reims and the marquis Oton: "Lead ye my men, by my commission." AOI. 

CCXXII 

That Emperour hath now six columns yare Naimes the Duke the seventh next prepares Of Peitevins and barons from Alverne; Forty thousand chevaliers might be there; Their horses good, their arms are all most fair. They're neath a cliff, in a vale by themselves; With his right hand King Charles hath them blessed, Them Jozerans shall lead, also Godselmes. AOI. 

CCXXIII 

And the eighth column hath Naimes made ready; Tis of Flamengs, and barons out of Frise; Forty thousand and more good knights are these, Nor lost by them has any battle been. And the King says: "These shall do my service." Between Rembalt and Hamon of Galice Shall they be led, for all their chivalry. AOI. 

CCXXIV 

Between Naimon and Jozeran the count Are prudent men for the ninth column found, Of Lotherengs and those out of Borgoune; Fifty thousand good knights they are, by count; In helmets laced and sarks of iron brown, Strong are their spears, short are the shafts cut down; If the Arrabits demur not, but come out And trust themselves to these, they'll strike them down. Tierris the Duke shall lead them, of Argoune. AOI. 

CCXXV 

The tenth column is of barons of France, Five score thousand of our best capitans; Lusty of limb, and proud of countenance, Snowy their heads are, and their beards are blanched, In doubled sarks, and in hauberks they're clad, Girt on their sides Frankish and Spanish brands And noble shields of divers cognisance. Soon as they mount, the battle they demand, "Monjoie" they cry.  With them goes Charlemagne. Gefreid d'Anjou carries that oriflamme; Saint Peter's  twas, and bare the name Roman, But on that day Monjoie, by change, it gat. AOI. 

CCXXVI 

That Emperour down from his horse descends; To the green grass, kneeling, his face he bends. Then turns his eyes towards the Orient, Calls upon God with heartiest intent: "Very Father, this day do me defend, Who to Jonas succour didst truly send Out of the whale's belly, where he was pent; And who didst spare the king of Niniven, And Daniel from marvellous torment When he was caged within the lions' den; And three children, all in a fire ardent: Thy gracious Love to me be here present. In Thy Mercy, if it please Thee, consent That my nephew Rollant I may avenge. When he had prayed, upon his feet he stepped, With the strong mark of virtue signed his head; Upon his swift charger the King mounted While Jozerans and Neimes his stirrup held; He took his shield, his trenchant spear he kept; Fine limbs he had, both gallant and well set; Clear was his face and filled with good intent. Vigorously he cantered onward thence. In front, in rear, they sounded their trumpets, Above them all boomed the olifant again. Then all the Franks for pity of Rollant wept.
