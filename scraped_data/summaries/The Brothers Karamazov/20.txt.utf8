Fyodor dismisses the servants. He gets more and more drunk on cognac and starts making up stories about Zosima. He asks Ivan why he won't go to Chermashnya as a favor to him, but Ivan continues to refuse.

Fyodor then tells Alyosha some unsavory stories about his dead mother. After getting through one story about how he spit upon one of her religious icons, Fyodor notices that Alyosha has, all of a sudden, begun to tremble and weep, just as his mother, the "shrieker," used to do.

Fyodor wonders if he's gone too far, and Ivan savagely reminds him that Alyosha's mother is his mother, too.

At this point, Dmitri suddenly barges into the room.
