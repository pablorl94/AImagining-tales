Now, good sir, You know me, do you not? 

JAILER  For a worthy lady And one who much I honor. 

PAULINA Pray you then,	 Conduct me to the Queen. 

JAILER I may not, madam. To the contrary I have express commandment. 

PAULINA Here’s ado, to lock up honesty and honor from Th’ access of gentle visitors. Is ’t lawful, pray you,	 To see her women? Any of them? Emilia? 

JAILER So please you, madam, To put apart these your attendants, I Shall bring Emilia forth. 

PAULINA I pray now, call her.—	 Withdraw yourselves. 

<ACTION>Attendants and Gentleman exit.</ACTION> 

JAILER And, madam, I must be present at your conference. 

PAULINA Well, be ’t so, prithee.	Jailer exits. Here’s such ado to make no stain a stain As passes coloring.	 

<ACTION>Enter Emilia with Jailer.</ACTION> 

Dear gentlewoman, How fares our gracious lady? 

EMILIA As well as one so great and so forlorn May hold together. On her frights and griefs, Which never tender lady hath borne greater,	 She is something before her time delivered. 

PAULINA A boy? 

EMILIA A daughter, and a goodly babe, Lusty and like to live. The Queen receives Much comfort in ’t, says “My poor prisoner,	 I am innocent as you.” 

PAULINA   I dare be sworn. These dangerous unsafe lunes i’ th’ King, beshrew them! He must be told on ’t, and he shall. The office	 Becomes a woman best. I’ll take ’t upon me. If I prove honey-mouthed, let my tongue blister And never to my red-looked anger be The trumpet anymore. Pray you, Emilia, Commend my best obedience to the Queen.	 If she dares trust me with her little babe, I’ll show ’t the King and undertake to be Her advocate to th’ loud’st We do not know How he may soften at the sight o’ th’ child. The silence often of pure innocence	 Persuades when speaking fails. 

EMILIA Most worthy madam, Your honor and your goodness is so evident That your free undertaking cannot miss A thriving issue. There is no lady living	 So meet for this great errand. Please your Ladyship To visit the next room, I’ll presently Acquaint the Queen of your most noble offer, Who but today hammered of this design, But durst not tempt a minister of honor	 Lest she should be denied. 

PAULINA Tell her, Emilia, I’ll use that tongue I have. If wit flow from ’t As boldness from my bosom, let ’t not be doubted I shall do good. 

EMILIA  Now be you blest for it! I’ll to the Queen. Please you come something nearer. 

JAILER , <ACTION> to Paulina</ACTION> Madam, if ’t please the Queen to send the babe, I know not what I shall incur to pass it,	 Having no warrant. 

PAULINA You need not fear it, sir. This child was prisoner to the womb, and is By law and process of great nature thence Freed and enfranchised, not a party to	 The anger of the King, nor guilty of, If any be, the trespass of the Queen. 

JAILER I do believe it. 

PAULINA Do not you fear. Upon mine honor, I Will stand betwixt you and danger.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
