<ACTION>Enter Cleopatra and Enobarbus.</ACTION> 

CLEOPATRA I will be even with thee, doubt it not. 

ENOBARBUS But why, why, why? 

CLEOPATRA Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars And say’st it is not fit. 

ENOBARBUS Well, is it, is it?	 

CLEOPATRA Is ’t not denounced against us? Why should not we Be there in person? 

ENOBARBUS Well, I could reply: If we should serve with horse and mares together, The horse were merely lost. The mares would bear	 A soldier and his horse. 

CLEOPATRA What is ’t you say? 

ENOBARBUS Your presence needs must puzzle Antony, Take from his heart, take from his brain, from ’s time What should not then be spared. He is already	 Traduced for levity, and ’tis said in Rome That Photinus, an eunuch, and your maids Manage this war. 

CLEOPATRA Sink Rome, and their tongues rot That speak against us! A charge we bear i’ th’ war,	 And as the president of my kingdom will Appear there for a man. Speak not against it. I will not stay behind. 

<ACTION>Enter Antony and Canidius.</ACTION> 

ENOBARBUS Nay, I have done. Here comes the Emperor.	 

ANTONY Is it not strange, Canidius, That from Tarentum and Brundusium He could so quickly cut the Ionian Sea And take in Toryne?—You have heard on ’t, sweet? 

CLEOPATRA Celerity is never more admired	 Than by the negligent. 

ANTONY A good rebuke, Which might have well becomed the best of men, To taunt at slackness.—Canidius, we will fight With him by sea.	 

CLEOPATRA By sea, what else? 

CANIDIUS  Why will My lord do so? 

ANTONY For that he dares us to ’t. 

ENOBARBUS So hath my lord dared him to single fight.	 

CANIDIUS Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia, Where Caesar fought with Pompey. But these offers, Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off, And so should you. 

ENOBARBUS Your ships are not well manned,	 Your mariners are muleteers, reapers, people Engrossed by swift impress. In Caesar’s fleet Are those that often have ’gainst Pompey fought. Their ships are yare, yours heavy. No disgrace Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,	 Being prepared for land. 

ANTONY By sea, by sea. 

ENOBARBUS Most worthy sir, you therein throw away The absolute soldiership you have by land, Distract your army, which doth most consist	 Of war-marked footmen, leave unexecuted Your own renownèd knowledge, quite forgo The way which promises assurance, and Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard From firm security.	 

ANTONY I’ll fight at sea. 

CLEOPATRA I have sixty sails, Caesar none better. 

ANTONY Our overplus of shipping will we burn, And with the rest full-manned, from th’ head of Actium	 Beat th’ approaching Caesar. But if we fail, We then can do ’t at land. 

<ACTION>Enter a Messenger.</ACTION> 

Thy business? 

MESSENGER The news is true, my lord; he is descried. Caesar has taken Toryne.	 <ACTION>He exits.  </ACTION> 

ANTONY Can he be there in person? ’Tis impossible; Strange that his power should be. Canidius, Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land, And our twelve thousand horse. We’ll to our ship.— Away, my Thetis.	 

<ACTION>Enter a Soldier.</ACTION> 

How now, worthy soldier? 

SOLDIER O noble emperor, do not fight by sea! Trust not to rotten planks. Do you misdoubt This sword and these my wounds? Let th’ Egyptians And the Phoenicians go a-ducking. We	 Have used to conquer standing on the earth And fighting foot to foot. 

ANTONY Well, well, away. 

<ACTION>Antony, Cleopatra, and Enobarbus exit.</ACTION> 

SOLDIER By Hercules, I think I am i’ th’ right. 

CANIDIUS Soldier, thou art, but his whole action grows	 Not in the power on ’t. So our leader’s led, And we are women’s men. 

SOLDIER You keep by land The legions and the horse whole, do you not? 

CANIDIUS Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,	 Publicola, and Caelius are for sea, But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar’s Carries beyond belief. 

SOLDIER While he was yet in Rome, His power went out in such distractions as	 Beguiled all spies. 

CANIDIUS Who’s his lieutenant, hear you? 

SOLDIER They say one Taurus. 

CANIDIUS Well I know the man. 

<ACTION>Enter a Messenger.</ACTION> 

MESSENGER The Emperor calls Canidius.	 

CANIDIUS With news the time’s in labor, and throws forth Each minute some. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
