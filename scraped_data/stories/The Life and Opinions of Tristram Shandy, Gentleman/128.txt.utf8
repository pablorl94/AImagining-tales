Chapter 3.XI. 

I am a Turk if I had not as much forgot my mother, as if Nature had plaistered me up, and set me down naked upon the banks of the river Nile, without one.--Your most obedient servant, Madam--I've cost you a great deal of trouble,--I wish it may answer;--but you have left a crack in my back,--and here's a great piece fallen off here before,--and what must I do with this foot?--I shall never reach England with it. 

For my own part, I never wonder at any thing;--and so often has my judgment deceived me in my life, that I always suspect it, right or wrong,--at least I am seldom hot upon cold subjects. For all this, I reverence truth as much as any body; and when it has slipped us, if a man will but take me by the hand, and go quietly and search for it, as for a thing we have both lost, and can neither of us do well without,--I'll go to the world's end with him:--But I hate disputes,--and therefore (bating religious points, or such as touch society) I would almost subscribe to any thing which does not choak me in the first passage, rather than be drawn into one--But I cannot bear suffocation,--and bad smells worst of all.--For which reasons, I resolved from the beginning, That if ever the army of martyrs was to be augmented,--or a new one raised,--I would have no hand in it, one way or t'other.
