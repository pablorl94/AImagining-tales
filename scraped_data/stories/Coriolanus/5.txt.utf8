<ACTION>Enter Cominius as it were in retire, with Soldiers.</ACTION> 

COMINIUS Breathe you, my friends. Well fought! We are come off Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands Nor cowardly in retire. Believe me, sirs, We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,	 By interims and conveying gusts we have heard The charges of our friends. The Roman gods Lead their successes as we wish our own, That both our powers, with smiling fronts encount’ring,	 May give you thankful sacrifice! 

<ACTION>Enter a Messenger.</ACTION> 

Thy news? 

MESSENGER The citizens of Corioles have issued And given to Lartius and to Martius battle. I saw our party to their trenches driven,	 And then I came away. 

COMINIUS Though thou speakest truth, Methinks thou speak’st not well. How long is ’t since? 

MESSENGER Above an hour, my lord.	 

COMINIUS ’Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums. How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour And bring thy news so late? 

MESSENGER Spies of the Volsces Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel	 Three or four miles about; else had I, sir, Half an hour since brought my report.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Martius, bloody.</ACTION> 

COMINIUS Who’s yonder, That does appear as he were flayed? O gods, He has the stamp of Martius, and I have	 Before-time seen him thus. 

MARTIUS Come I too late? 

COMINIUS The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor More than I know the sound of Martius’ tongue From every meaner man.	 

MARTIUS Come I too late? 

COMINIUS Ay, if you come not in the blood of others, But mantled in your own. 

MARTIUS O, let me clip you In arms as sound as when I wooed, in heart	 As merry as when our nuptial day was done And tapers burnt to bedward!	 <ACTION>They embrace.</ACTION> 

COMINIUS Flower of warriors, how is ’t with Titus Lartius? 

MARTIUS As with a man busied about decrees, Condemning some to death and some to exile;	 Ransoming him or pitying, threat’ning th’ other; Holding Corioles in the name of Rome Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash, To let him slip at will. 

COMINIUS Where is that slave	 Which told me they had beat you to your trenches? Where is he? Call him hither. 

MARTIUS Let him alone. He did inform the truth. But for our gentlemen, The common file—a plague! Tribunes for them!—	 The mouse ne’er shunned the cat as they did budge From rascals worse than they. 

COMINIUS But how prevailed you? 

MARTIUS Will the time serve to tell? I do not think. Where is the enemy? Are you lords o’ th’ field?	 If not, why cease you till you are so? 

COMINIUS Martius, we have at disadvantage fought And did retire to win our purpose. 

MARTIUS How lies their battle? Know you on which side They have placed their men of trust?	 

COMINIUS As I guess, Martius, Their bands i’ th’ vaward are the Antiates, Of their best trust; o’er them Aufidius, Their very heart of hope.	 

MARTIUS I do beseech you, By all the battles wherein we have fought, By th’ blood we have shed together, by th’ vows we have made To endure friends, that you directly set me	 Against Aufidius and his Antiates, And that you not delay the present, but, Filling the air with swords advanced and darts, We prove this very hour. 

COMINIUS Though I could wish	 You were conducted to a gentle bath And balms applied to you, yet dare I never Deny your asking. Take your choice of those That best can aid your action. 

MARTIUS Those are they	 That most are willing. If any such be here— As it were sin to doubt—that love this painting Wherein you see me smeared; if any fear Lesser his person than an ill report; If any think brave death outweighs bad life,	 And that his country’s dearer than himself; Let him alone, or so many so minded, Wave thus to express his disposition And follow Martius.	 

<ACTION>He waves his sword.They all shout and wave their swords,take him up in their arms, and cast up their caps.</ACTION> 

O, me alone! Make you a sword of me?	 If these shows be not outward, which of you But is four Volsces? None of you but is Able to bear against the great Aufidius A shield as hard as his. A certain number, Though thanks to all, must I select from all.	 The rest shall bear the business in some other fight, As cause will be obeyed. Please you to march, And I shall quickly draw out my command, Which men are best inclined. 

COMINIUS March on, my fellows.	 Make good this ostentation, and you shall Divide in all with us. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
