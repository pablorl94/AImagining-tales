<ACTION>Enter the masquers, Gratiano and Salarino.</ACTION> 

GRATIANO This is the penthouse under which Lorenzo Desired us to make stand. 

SALARINO His hour is almost past. 

GRATIANO And it is marvel he outdwells his hour, For lovers ever run before the clock.	 

SALARINO O, ten times faster Venus’ pigeons fly To seal love’s bonds new-made than they are wont To keep obligèd faith unforfeited. 

GRATIANO That ever holds. Who riseth from a feast With that keen appetite that he sits down?	 Where is the horse that doth untread again His tedious measures with the unbated fire That he did pace them first? All things that are, Are with more spirit chasèd than enjoyed. How like a younger or a prodigal	 The scarfèd bark puts from her native bay, Hugged and embracèd by the strumpet wind; How like the prodigal doth she return With overweathered ribs and raggèd sails, Lean, rent, and beggared by the strumpet wind!	 

<ACTION>Enter Lorenzo.</ACTION> 

SALARINO Here comes Lorenzo. More of this hereafter. 

LORENZO Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode. Not I but my affairs have made you wait. When you shall please to play the thieves for wives, I’ll watch as long for you then. Approach.	 Here dwells my father Jew.—Ho! Who’s within? 

<ACTION>Enter Jessica above, dressed as a boy.</ACTION> 

JESSICA Who are you? Tell me for more certainty, Albeit I’ll swear that I do know your tongue. 

LORENZO Lorenzo, and thy love. 

JESSICA Lorenzo certain, and my love indeed,	 For who love I so much? And now who knows But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours? 

LORENZO Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art. 

<ACTION>JESSICA</ACTION> Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains. I am glad ’tis night, you do not look on me,	 For I am much ashamed of my exchange. But love is blind, and lovers cannot see The pretty follies that themselves commit, For if they could, Cupid himself would blush To see me thus transformèd to a boy.	 

LORENZO Descend, for you must be my torchbearer. 

JESSICA What, must I hold a candle to my shames? They in themselves, good sooth, are too too light. Why, ’tis an office of discovery, love, And I should be obscured.	 

LORENZO So are you, sweet, Even in the lovely garnish of a boy. But come at once, For the close night doth play the runaway, And we are stayed for at Bassanio’s feast.	 

JESSICA I will make fast the doors and gild myself With some more ducats, and be with you straight. 

<ACTION>Jessica exits, above.</ACTION> 

GRATIANO Now, by my hood, a gentle and no Jew! 

LORENZO Beshrew me but I love her heartily, For she is wise, if I can judge of her,	 And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true, And true she is, as she hath proved herself. And therefore, like herself, wise, fair, and true, Shall she be placèd in my constant soul. 

<ACTION>Enter Jessica, below.</ACTION> 

What, art thou come? On, gentleman, away!	 Our masquing mates by this time for us stay. 

<ACTION>All but Gratiano exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Antonio.</ACTION> 

ANTONIO Who’s there? 

GRATIANO  Signior Antonio? 

ANTONIO Fie, fie, Gratiano, where are all the rest? ’Tis nine o’clock! Our friends all stay for you.	 No masque tonight; the wind is come about; Bassanio presently will go aboard. I have sent twenty out to seek for you. 

GRATIANO I am glad on ’t. I desire no more delight Than to be under sail and gone tonight.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
