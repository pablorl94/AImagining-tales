The narrator (or Melville) tells you that no other part of the world has as many hermits living there as the Galapagos.

Captains can be tyrannical and awful, and escaping into the Galapagos is one of the few ways sailors have to get away.

Turtle-hunting makes hermits sometimes too; people go into the interiors, get lost, and their ships leave without them.

Or sometimes people are exiled by their captains.

He tells a story of a guy marooned on an island who was dying of thirst, till he came upon a seal, stabbed it, and sucked its blood.

Ick.

Vampire travel writing.

And another story about a guy who escaped an island by killing seals and making a float of their corpses.

He says people sometimes post bottles with messages in them on sticks; a kind of hermits' post office.

And as a cheery end, he talks about gravestones on the islands.

And that's it. Farewell, Galapagos novella. You were long, and your popularity is hard to figure, but at least Shmoop is done with you.
