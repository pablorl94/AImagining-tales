<ACTION>Enter young Bertram Count of Rossillion, his motherthe Countess, and Helen, Lord Lafew, all in black.</ACTION> 

COUNTESS In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband. 

BERTRAM And I in going, madam, weep o’er my father’s death anew; but I must attend his Majesty’s command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore	 in subjection. 

LAFEW  You shall find of the King a husband, madam; you, sir, a father. He that so generally is at all times good must of necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted	 rather than lack it where there is such abundance. 

COUNTESS What hope is there of his Majesty’s amendment? 

LAFEW  He hath abandoned his physicians, madam, under whose practices he hath persecuted time	 with hope, and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time. 

COUNTESS This young gentlewoman had a father—O, that “had,” how sad a passage ’tis!—whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched	 so far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would for the King’s sake he were living! I think it would be the death of the King’s disease. 

LAFEW  How called you the man you speak of,	 madam? 

COUNTESS He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon. 

LAFEW He was excellent indeed, madam. The King very lately spoke of him admiringly, and mourningly.	 He was skillful enough to have lived still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality. 

BERTRAM What is it, my good lord, the King languishes of? 

LAFEW A fistula, my lord.	 

BERTRAM I heard not of it before. 

LAFEW I would it were not notorious.—Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbon? 

COUNTESS His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my overlooking. I have those hopes of her good	 that her education promises. Her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity—they are virtues and traitors too. In her they are the better for their simpleness.	 She derives her honesty and achieves her goodness. 

LAFEW Your commendations, madam, get from her tears. 

COUNTESS ’Tis the best brine a maiden can season her	 praise in. The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek.—No more of this, Helena. Go to. No more, lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than to have—	 

HELEN I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too. 

LAFEW Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead, excessive grief the enemy to the living. 

COUNTESS  If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal.	 

BERTRAM Madam, I desire your holy wishes. 

LAFEW How understand we that? 

COUNTESS Be thou blessed, Bertram, and succeed thy father In manners as in shape. Thy blood and virtue Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness	 Share with thy birthright. Love all, trust a few, Do wrong to none. Be able for thine enemy Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend Under thy own life’s key Be checked for silence, But never taxed for speech. What heaven more will,	 That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down, Fall on thy head. To Lafew. Farewell, my lord. ’Tis an unseasoned courtier. Good my lord, Advise him. 

LAFEW He cannot want the best that shall	 Attend his love. 

COUNTESS Heaven bless him.—Farewell, Bertram. 

BERTRAM The best wishes that can be forged in your thoughts be servants to you.

<ACTION>To Helen.</ACTION> Be comfortable to my mother, your	 mistress, and make much of her. 

LAFEW Farewell, pretty lady. You must hold the credit of your father.

HELEN O, were that all! I think not on my father, And these great tears grace his remembrance more	 Than those I shed for him. What was he like? I have forgot him. My imagination Carries no favor in ’t but Bertram’s. I am undone. There is no living, none, If Bertram be away. ’Twere all one	 That I should love a bright particular star And think to wed it, he is so above me. In his bright radiance and collateral light Must I be comforted, not in his sphere. Th’ ambition in my love thus plagues itself:	 The hind that would be mated by the lion Must die for love. ’Twas pretty, though a plague, To see him every hour, to sit and draw His archèd brows, his hawking eye, his curls In our heart’s table—heart too capable	 Of every line and trick of his sweet favor. But now he’s gone, and my idolatrous fancy Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here? 

<ACTION>Enter Parolles.</ACTION> 

One that goes with him. I love him for his sake, And yet I know him a notorious liar,	 Think him a great way fool, solely a coward. Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him That they take place when virtue’s steely bones Looks bleak i’ th’ cold wind. Withal, full oft we see Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.	 

PAROLLES Save you, fair queen. 

HELEN And you, monarch. 

PAROLLES No. 

HELEN And no. 

PAROLLES Are you meditating on virginity?	 

HELEN  Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity. How may we barricado it against him? 

PAROLLES Keep him out. 

HELEN But he assails, and our virginity, though	 valiant in the defense, yet is weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance. 

PAROLLES There is none. Man setting down before you will undermine you and blow you up. 

HELEN Bless our poor virginity from underminers and	 blowers-up! Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men? 

PAROLLES Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up. Marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made you	 lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase, and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity by	 being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is ever lost. ’Tis too cold a companion. Away with ’t. 

HELEN I will stand for ’t a little, though therefore I die a virgin.	 

PAROLLES There’s little can be said in ’t. ’Tis against the rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin; virginity murders itself and should be buried in	 highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese, consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of	 self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by ’t. Out with ’t! Within ten year it will make itself two, which is a goodly increase, and the principal itself not much the worse. Away with ’t!	 

HELEN  How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking? 

PAROLLES Let me see. Marry, ill, to like him that ne’er it likes. ’Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept, the less worth. Off with ’t	 while ’tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion, richly suited but unsuitable, just like the brooch and the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge	 than in your cheek. And your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French withered pears: it looks ill, it eats dryly; many, ’tis a withered pear. It was formerly better, marry, yet ’tis a withered pear. Will you anything with it?	 

HELEN Not my virginity, yet— There shall your master have a thousand loves, A mother, and a mistress, and a friend, A phoenix, captain, and an enemy, A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,	 A counselor, a traitress, and a dear; His humble ambition, proud humility, His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet, His faith, his sweet disaster, with a world Of pretty, fond adoptious christendoms	 That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he— I know not what he shall. God send him well. The court’s a learning place, and he is one— 

PAROLLES What one, i’ faith? 

HELEN  That I wish well. ’Tis pity—	 

PAROLLES What’s pity? 

HELEN That wishing well had not a body in ’t Which might be felt, that we, the poorer born, Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes, Might with effects of them follow our friends	 And show what we alone must think, which never Returns us thanks.

PAGE  Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you. 

PAROLLES  Little Helen, farewell. If I can remember thee, I will think of thee at court.	 

HELEN  Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star. 

PAROLLES  Under Mars, I. 

HELEN I especially think under Mars. 

PAROLLES Why under Mars?	 

HELEN The wars hath so kept you under that you must needs be born under Mars. 

PAROLLES When he was predominant. 

HELEN When he was retrograde, I think rather. 

PAROLLES Why think you so?	 

HELEN You go so much backward when you fight. 

PAROLLES That’s for advantage. 

HELEN So is running away, when fear proposes the safety. But the composition that your valor and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I	 like the wear well. 

PAROLLES I am so full of businesses I cannot answer thee acutely. I will return perfect courtier, in the which my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier’s counsel	 and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee, else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes thee away. Farewell. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast none, remember thy friends. Get thee a good husband,	 and use him as he uses thee. So, farewell.

HELEN Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie Which we ascribe to heaven. The fated sky Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.	 What power is it which mounts my love so high, That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye? The mightiest space in fortune nature brings To join like likes and kiss like native things. Impossible be strange attempts to those	 That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove To show her merit that did miss her love? The King’s disease—my project may deceive me, But my intents are fixed and will not leave me.
