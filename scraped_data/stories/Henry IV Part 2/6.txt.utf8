<ACTION>Enter Northumberland, his wife, and the wife toHarry Percy.</ACTION> 

NORTHUMBERLAND I pray thee, loving wife and gentle daughter, Give even way unto my rough affairs. Put not you on the visage of the times And be, like them, to Percy troublesome. 

LADY NORTHUMBERLAND I have given over. I will speak no more.	 Do what you will; your wisdom be your guide. 

NORTHUMBERLAND Alas, sweet wife, my honor is at pawn, And, but my going, nothing can redeem it. 

LADY PERCY O yet, for God’s sake, go not to these wars. The time was, father, that you broke your word	 When you were more endeared to it than now, When your own Percy, when my heart’s dear Harry, Threw many a northward look to see his father Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain. Who then persuaded you to stay at home? There were two honors lost, yours and your son’s. For yours, the God of heaven brighten it. For his, it stuck upon him as the sun In the gray vault of heaven, and by his light Did all the chivalry of England move	 To do brave acts. He was indeed the glass Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves. He had no legs that practiced not his gait; And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish, Became the accents of the valiant;	 For those that could speak low and tardily Would turn their own perfection to abuse To seem like him. So that in speech, in gait, In diet, in affections of delight, In military rules, humors of blood, He was the mark and glass, copy and book, That fashioned others. And him—O wondrous him! 

O miracle of men!—him did you leave, Second to none, unseconded by you, To look upon the hideous god of war	 In disadvantage, to abide a field Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur’s name Did seem defensible.So you left him. Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong To hold your honor more precise and nice	 With others than with him. Let them alone. The Marshal and the Archbishop are strong. Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers, Today might I, hanging on Hotspur’s neck, Have talked of Monmouth’s grave. 

NORTHUMBERLAND Beshrew your heart, Fair daughter, you do draw my spirits from me With new lamenting ancient oversights. But I must go and meet with danger there,	 Or it will seek me in another place And find me worse provided. 

LADY NORTHUMBERLAND O, fly to Scotland Till that the nobles and the armèd commons Have of their puissance made a little taste.	 

LADY PERCY If they get ground and vantage of the King, Then join you with them like a rib of steel To make strength stronger; but, for all our loves, First let them try themselves. So did your son; He was so suffered. So came I a widow,	 And never shall have length of life enough To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven For recordation to my noble husband. 

NORTHUMBERLAND Come, come, go in with me. ’Tis with my mind	 As with the tide swelled up unto his height, That makes a still-stand, running neither way. Fain would I go to meet the Archbishop, But many thousand reasons hold me back. I will resolve for Scotland. There am I	 Till time and vantage crave my company. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
