KING EDWARD Now here a period of tumultuous broils. Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight. For Somerset, off with his guilty head. Go bear them hence. I will not hear them speak. 

OXFORD For my part, I’ll not trouble thee with words.	 

SOMERSET Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune. 

QUEEN MARGARET So part we sadly in this troublous world To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem. 

<ACTION>Oxford and Somerset exit, under guard.</ACTION> 

KING EDWARD Is proclamation made that who finds Edward Shall have a high reward, and he his life?	 

RICHARD It is, and lo where youthful Edward comes. 

<ACTION>Enter Prince Edward, wearing the red rose,under guard.</ACTION> 

KING EDWARD Bring forth the gallant; let us hear him speak. What, can so young a thorn begin to prick?— Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,	 And all the trouble thou hast turned me to? 

PRINCE EDWARD Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York. Suppose that I am now my father’s mouth: Resign thy chair, and where I stand, kneel thou, Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee	 Which, traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to. 

QUEEN MARGARET Ah, that thy father had been so resolved! 

RICHARD That you might still have worn the petticoat And ne’er have stol’n the breech from Lancaster. 

PRINCE EDWARD Let Aesop fable in a winter’s night;	 His currish riddles sorts not with this place. 

RICHARD By heaven, brat, I’ll plague you for that word. 

QUEEN MARGARET Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men. 

RICHARD For God’s sake, take away this captive scold. 

PRINCE EDWARD Nay, take away this scolding crookback, rather.	 

KING EDWARD Peace, willful boy, or I will charm your tongue. 

CLARENCE , <ACTION> to Prince Edward</ACTION> Untutored lad, thou art too malapert. 

PRINCE EDWARD I know my duty. You are all undutiful. Lascivious Edward, and thou perjured George, And thou misshapen Dick, I tell you all	 I am your better, traitors as you are, And thou usurp’st my father’s right and mine. 

KING EDWARD Take that, the likeness of this railer here!	 <ACTION>Stabs him.</ACTION> 

RICHARD Sprawl’st thou? Take that to end thy agony! <ACTION>Richard stabs him.</ACTION> 

CLARENCE And there’s for twitting me with perjury.	 <ACTION>Clarence stabs him</ACTION> . 

QUEEN MARGARET O, kill me too! 

RICHARD Marry, and shall.	 <ACTION>Offers to kill her.</ACTION> 

KING EDWARD Hold, Richard, hold, for we have done too much. 

RICHARD Why should she live to fill the world with words? <ACTION>Queen Margaret faints.</ACTION> 

KING EDWARD What, doth she swoon? Use means for her recovery.	 <ACTION>They attempt to revive her.</ACTION> 

RICHARD ,  <ACTION>taking Clarence aside</ACTION> Clarence, excuse me to the King my brother. I’ll hence to London on a serious matter. Ere you come there, be sure to hear some news. 

CLARENCE  What? What? 

RICHARD The Tower, the Tower!	He exits.   

QUEEN MARGARET ,  <ACTION>rising from her swoon</ACTION> O Ned, sweet Ned, speak to thy mother, boy. Canst thou not speak? O traitors, murderers! They that stabbed Caesar shed no blood at all, Did not offend, nor were not worthy blame, If this foul deed were by to equal it.	 He was a man; this, in respect, a child, And men ne’er spend their fury on a child. What’s worse than murderer, that I may name it? No, no, my heart will burst an if I speak, And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.	 Butchers and villains, bloody cannibals, How sweet a plant have you untimely cropped! You have no children, butchers. If you had, The thought of them would have stirred up remorse. But if you ever chance to have a child,	 Look in his youth to have him so cut off As, deathsmen, you have rid this sweet young prince. 

KING EDWARD Away with her. Go bear her hence perforce. 

QUEEN MARGARET Nay, never bear me hence! Dispatch me here. Here sheathe thy sword; I’ll pardon thee my death.	 What, wilt thou not?—Then, Clarence, do it thou. 

CLARENCE By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease. 

QUEEN MARGARET Good Clarence, do! Sweet Clarence, do thou do it. 

CLARENCE Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it? 

QUEEN MARGARET Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself.	 ’Twas sin before, but now ’tis charity. What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil’s butcher, Richard, Hard-favored Richard? Richard, where art thou? Thou art not here. Murder is thy alms-deed;	 Petitioners for blood thou ne’er putt’st back. 

KING EDWARD Away, I say!  <ACTION>(To Soldiers.) </ACTION> I charge you bear her hence. 

QUEEN MARGARET So come to you and yours as to this prince! 

<ACTION>Queen Margaret exits under guard.Soldiers carry off Prince Edward’s body.</ACTION> 

KING EDWARD Where’s Richard gone? 

CLARENCE To London all in post, and, as I guess, To make a bloody supper in the Tower. 

KING EDWARD He’s sudden if a thing comes in his head. Now march we hence. Discharge the common sort With pay and thanks, and let’s away to London	 And see our gentle queen how well she fares. By this I hope she hath a son for me. <ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
