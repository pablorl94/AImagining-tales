<ACTION>Sennet. Enter King, Gloucester, and Exeter,with Attendants.</ACTION> 

KING HENRY ,  <ACTION>to Gloucester</ACTION> Have you perused the letters from the Pope, The Emperor, and the Earl of Armagnac? 

GLOUCESTER I have, my lord, and their intent is this: They humbly sue unto your Excellence To have a godly peace concluded of	 Between the realms of England and of France. 

KING HENRY How doth your Grace affect their motion? 

GLOUCESTER Well, my good lord, and as the only means To stop effusion of our Christian blood And stablish quietness on every side.	 

KING HENRY Ay, marry, uncle, for I always thought It was both impious and unnatural That such immanity and bloody strife Should reign among professors of one faith. 

GLOUCESTER Besides, my lord, the sooner to effect	 And surer bind this knot of amity, The Earl of Armagnac, near knit to Charles, A man of great authority in France, Proffers his only daughter to your Grace In marriage, with a large and sumptuous dowry.	 

KING HENRY Marriage, uncle? Alas, my years are young; And fitter is my study and my books Than wanton dalliance with a paramour. Yet call th’ Ambassadors and, as you please, So let them have their answers every one.	 

<ACTION>An Attendant exits.</ACTION> 

I shall be well content with any choice Tends to God’s glory and my country’s weal. 

<ACTION>Enter Winchester, dressed in cardinal’s robes,and the Ambassador of Armagnac, a Papal Legate,and another Ambassador.</ACTION> 

EXETER ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> What, is my Lord of Winchester installed And called unto a cardinal’s degree? Then I perceive that will be verified	 Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy: “If once he come to be a cardinal, He’ll make his cap coequal with the crown.” 

KING HENRY My Lords Ambassadors, your several suits Have been considered and debated on;	 Your purpose is both good and reasonable, And therefore are we certainly resolved To draw conditions of a friendly peace, Which by my Lord of Winchester we mean Shall be transported presently to France.	 

GLOUCESTER ,  <ACTION>to the Ambassador of Armagnac</ACTION> And for the proffer of my lord your master, I have informed his Highness so at large As, liking of the lady’s virtuous gifts, Her beauty, and the value of her dower, He doth intend she shall be England’s queen.	 

KING HENRY ,  <ACTION>handing a jewel to the Ambassador</ACTION> In argument and proof of which contract, Bear her this jewel, pledge of my affection.— And so, my Lord Protector, see them guarded And safely brought to Dover, where, inshipped, Commit them to the fortune of the sea.	 

<ACTION>All except Winchester and Legate exit.</ACTION> 

WINCHESTER Stay, my Lord Legate; you shall first receive The sum of money which I promisèd Should be delivered to his Holiness For clothing me in these grave ornaments. 

LEGATE I will attend upon your Lordship’s leisure.	 <ACTION>He exits.  </ACTION> 

WINCHESTER Now Winchester will not submit, I trow, Or be inferior to the proudest peer. Humphrey of Gloucester, thou shalt well perceive That neither in birth or for authority The Bishop will be overborne by thee.	 I’ll either make thee stoop and bend thy knee, Or sack this country with a mutiny. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
