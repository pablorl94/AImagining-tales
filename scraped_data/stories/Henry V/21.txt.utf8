<ACTION>Enter Constable, Orléans, Bourbon, Dauphin, andRambures.</ACTION> 

CONSTABLE Ô diable! 

ORLÉANS Ô Seigneur! Le jour est perdu, tout est perdu! 

DAUPHIN Mort de ma vie, all is confounded, all! Reproach and everlasting shame Sits mocking in our plumes.	 <ACTION>A short Alarum.  </ACTION> Ô méchante Fortune! Do not run away. 

CONSTABLE  Why, all our ranks are broke. 

DAUPHIN O perdurable shame! Let’s stab ourselves. Be these the wretches that we played at dice for?	 

ORLÉANS Is this the king we sent to for his ransom? 

BOURBON Shame, and eternal shame, nothing but shame! Let us die. In once more! Back again! And he that will not follow Bourbon now, Let him go hence, and with his cap in hand	 Like a base pander hold the chamber door, Whilst by a slave, no gentler than my dog, His fairest daughter is contaminate. 

CONSTABLE Disorder, that hath spoiled us, friend us now. Let us on heaps go offer up our lives.	 

ORLÉANS We are enough yet living in the field To smother up the English in our throngs, If any order might be thought upon. 

BOURBON The devil take order now! I’ll to the throng. Let life be short, else shame will be too long.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
