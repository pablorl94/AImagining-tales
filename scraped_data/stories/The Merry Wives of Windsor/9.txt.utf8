<ACTION>Enter Mistress Ford and Mistress Page.</ACTION> 

MISTRESS FORD What, John! What, Robert! 

MISTRESS PAGE Quickly, quickly! Is the buck-basket— 

MISTRESS FORD I warrant.—What, Robert, I say! 

<ACTION>Enter John and Robert with a large buck-basket.</ACTION> 

MISTRESS PAGE Come, come, come. 

MISTRESS FORD Here, set it down.	 

MISTRESS PAGE Give your men the charge. We must be brief. 

MISTRESS FORD Marry, as I told you before, John and Robert, be ready here hard by in the brewhouse, and when I suddenly call you, come forth, and	 without any pause or staggering take this basket on your shoulders. That done, trudge with it in all haste, and carry it among the whitsters in Datchet Mead, and there empty it in the muddy ditch close by the Thames side.	 

MISTRESS PAGE You will do it? 

MISTRESS FORD I ha’ told them over and over. They lack no direction.—Be gone, and come when you are called.	 

<ACTION>John and Robert exit.</ACTION> 

MISTRESS PAGE Here comes little Robin.	 

<ACTION>Enter Robin.</ACTION> 

MISTRESS FORD How now, my eyas-musket? What news with you? 

ROBIN  My master, Sir John, is come in at your back door, Mistress Ford, and requests your company. 

MISTRESS PAGE You little Jack-a-Lent, have you been	 true to us? 

ROBIN Ay, I’ll be sworn. My master knows not of your being here and hath threatened to put me into everlasting liberty if I tell you of it, for he swears he’ll turn me away.	 

MISTRESS PAGE Thou ’rt a good boy. This secrecy of thine shall be a tailor to thee and shall make thee a new doublet and hose.—I’ll go hide me. 

MISTRESS FORD Do so.—Go tell thy master I am alone. 

<ACTION>Robin exits. </ACTION> 

Mistress Page, remember you your	 cue. 

MISTRESS PAGE I warrant thee. If I do not act it, hiss me.	 

<ACTION>She exits.</ACTION> 

MISTRESS FORD Go to, then. We’ll use this unwholesome humidity, this gross-wat’ry pumpion. We’ll	 teach him to know turtles from jays. 

<ACTION>Enter Sir John Falstaff.</ACTION> 

FALSTAFF “Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel?” Why, now let me die, for I have lived long enough. This is the period of my ambition. O, this blessèd hour!	 

MISTRESS FORD O, sweet Sir John! 

FALSTAFF Mistress Ford, I cannot cog. I cannot prate, Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish: I would thy husband were dead. I’ll speak it before the best lord: I would make thee my lady.	 

MISTRESS FORD I your lady, Sir John? Alas, I should be a pitiful lady. 

FALSTAFF Let the court of France show me such another. I see how thine eye would emulate the diamond. Thou hast the right arched beauty of the	 brow that becomes the ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of Venetian admittance. 

MISTRESS FORD A plain kerchief, Sir John. My brows become nothing else, nor that well neither. 

FALSTAFF Thou art a tyrant to say so. Thou wouldst	 make an absolute courtier, and the firm fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion to thy gait in a semicircled farthingale. I see what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature thy friend. Come, thou canst not hide it.	 

MISTRESS FORD Believe me, there’s no such thing in me. 

FALSTAFF What made me love thee? Let that persuade thee. There’s something extraordinary in thee. Come, I cannot cog and say thou art this and that	 like a many of these lisping hawthorn buds that come like women in men’s apparel and smell like Bucklersbury in simple time. I cannot. But I love thee, none but thee; and thou deserv’st it. 

MISTRESS FORD Do not betray me, sir. I fear you love	 Mistress Page. 

FALSTAFF  Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the Counter gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek of a lime-kiln. 

MISTRESS FORD Well, heaven knows how I love you,	 and you shall one day find it. 

FALSTAFF Keep in that mind. I’ll deserve it. 

MISTRESS FORD Nay, I must tell you, so you do, or else I could not be in that mind. 

<ACTION>Enter Robin.</ACTION> 

ROBIN Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford! Here’s Mistress	 Page at the door, sweating and blowing and looking wildly, and would needs speak with you presently. 

FALSTAFF She shall not see me. I will ensconce me behind the arras.	 

MISTRESS FORD Pray you, do so. She’s a very tattling woman.	 

<ACTION>Falstaff stands behind the arras.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Mistress Page.</ACTION> 

What’s the matter? How now? 

MISTRESS PAGE  O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You’re shamed, you’re overthrown, you’re undone	 forever! 

MISTRESS FORD  What’s the matter, good Mistress Page? 

MISTRESS PAGE O well-a-day, Mistress Ford, having an honest man to your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion!	 

MISTRESS FORD What cause of suspicion? 

MISTRESS PAGE What cause of suspicion? Out upon you! How am I mistook in you! 

MISTRESS FORD Why, alas, what’s the matter? 

MISTRESS PAGE Your husband’s coming hither, woman,	 with all the officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that he says is here now in the house, by your consent, to take an ill advantage of his absence. You are undone. 

MISTRESS FORD ’Tis not so, I hope.	 

MISTRESS PAGE Pray heaven it be not so, that you have such a man here! But ’tis most certain your husband’s coming, with half Windsor at his heels, to search for such a one. I come before to tell you. If you know yourself clear, why, I am glad of it. But if	 you have a friend here, convey, convey him out. Be not amazed! Call all your senses to you; defend your reputation, or bid farewell to your good life forever. 

MISTRESS FORD What shall I do? There is a gentleman,	 my dear friend; and I fear not mine own shame so much as his peril. I had rather than a thousand pound he were out of the house. 

MISTRESS PAGE For shame! Never stand “you had rather” and “you had rather.” Your husband’s here	 at hand. Bethink you of some conveyance. In the house you cannot hide him. O, how have you deceived me! Look, here is a basket. If he be of any reasonable stature, he may creep in here; and throw foul linen upon him, as if it were going to	 bucking. Or—it is whiting time—send him by your two men to Datchet Mead. 

MISTRESS FORD  He’s too big to go in there. What shall I do?	 

<ACTION>Falstaff comes forward.</ACTION> 

FALSTAFF Let me see ’t, let me see ’t! O, let me see ’t! I’ll	 in, I’ll in. Follow your friend’s counsel. I’ll in. 

MISTRESS PAGE  What, Sir John Falstaff?  <ACTION>Aside tohim.</ACTION> Are these your letters, knight? 

FALSTAFF , <ACTION> aside to Mistress Page</ACTION> I love thee. Help me away. Let me creep in here. I’ll never—	 

<ACTION>Falstaff goes into the basket; they coverhim with dirty clothes.</ACTION> 

MISTRESS PAGE ,  <ACTION>to Robin</ACTION> Help to cover your master, boy.—Call your men, Mistress Ford.—You dissembling knight!	 

<ACTION>Robin exits.</ACTION> 

MISTRESS FORD  What, John! Robert! John! 

<ACTION>Enter Robert and John.</ACTION> 

Go, take up these clothes here quickly. Where’s the	 cowlstaff? Look how you drumble! Carry them to the laundress in Datchet Mead. Quickly! Come. 

<ACTION>Enter Ford, Page, Doctor Caius,and Sir Hugh Evans.</ACTION> 

FORD  Pray you, come near. If I suspect without cause, why then make sport at me. Then let me be your jest; I deserve it.—How now? Whither bear you	 this? 

ROBERT AND JOHN To the laundress, forsooth. 

MISTRESS FORD Why, what have you to do whither they bear it? You were best meddle with buck-washing! 

FORD  Buck? I would I could wash myself of the buck.	 Buck, buck, buck! Ay, buck! I warrant you, buck, and of the season too, it shall appear. 

<ACTION>Robert and John exit with the buck-basket.</ACTION> 

Gentlemen, I have dreamed tonight; I’ll tell you my dream. Here, here, here be my keys. Ascend my chambers. Search, seek, find out. I’ll warrant we’ll	 unkennel the fox. Let me stop this way first.  

<ACTION>He locks the door. </ACTION> 

So, now uncape. 

PAGE Good Master Ford, be contented. You wrong yourself too much. 

FORD True, Master Page.—Up, gentlemen. You shall	 see sport anon. Follow me, gentlemen.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

SIR HUGH This is fery fantastical humors and jealousies. 

DOCTOR CAIUS By gar, ’tis no the fashion of France. It is not jealous in France.	 

PAGE Nay, follow him, gentlemen. See the issue of his search.	 

<ACTION>Page, Sir Hugh, and Caius exit.</ACTION> 

MISTRESS PAGE Is there not a double excellency in this? 

MISTRESS FORD  I know not which pleases me better— that my husband is deceived, or Sir John.	 

MISTRESS PAGE  What a taking was he in when your husband asked who was in the basket! 

MISTRESS FORD I am half afraid he will have need of washing, so throwing him into the water will do him a benefit.	 

MISTRESS PAGE Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the same strain were in the same distress. 

MISTRESS FORD I think my husband hath some special suspicion of Falstaff’s being here, for I never saw him so gross in his jealousy till now.	 

MISTRESS PAGE I will lay a plot to try that, and we will yet have more tricks with Falstaff. His dissolute disease will scarce obey this medicine. 

MISTRESS FORD Shall we send that foolish carrion Mistress Quickly to him, and excuse his throwing into	 the water, and give him another hope, to betray him to another punishment? 

MISTRESS PAGE  We will do it. Let him be sent for tomorrow eight o’clock to have amends. 

<ACTION>Enter Ford, Page, Doctor Caius, and Sir Hugh.</ACTION> 

FORD I cannot find him. Maybe the knave bragged of	 that he could not compass. 

MISTRESS PAGE , <ACTION> aside to Mistress Ford</ACTION> Heard you that? 

MISTRESS FORD You use me well, Master Ford, do you? 

FORD  Ay, I do so.	 

MISTRESS FORD Heaven make you better than your thoughts! 

FORD Amen! 

MISTRESS PAGE  You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford.	 

FORD  Ay, ay. I must bear it. 

SIR HUGH If there be anypody in the house, and in the chambers, and in the coffers, and in the presses, heaven forgive my sins at the day of judgment! 

DOCTOR CAIUS Be gar, nor I too. There is nobodies.	 

PAGE Fie, fie, Master Ford, are you not ashamed? What spirit, what devil suggests this imagination? I would not ha’ your distemper in this kind for the wealth of Windsor Castle. 

FORD ’Tis my fault, Master Page. I suffer for it.	 

SIR HUGH You suffer for a pad conscience. Your wife is as honest a ’omans as I will desires among five thousand, and five hundred too. 

DOCTOR CAIUS By gar, I see ’tis an honest woman. 

FORD Well, I promised you a dinner. Come, come,	 walk in the park. I pray you, pardon me. I will hereafter make known to you why I have done this.—Come, wife—come, Mistress Page, I pray you, pardon me. Pray, heartily, pardon me. 

<ACTION>Mistress Page and Mistress Ford exit.</ACTION> 

PAGE , <ACTION> to Caius and Sir Hugh</ACTION> Let’s go in, gentlemen.	 But, trust me, we’ll mock him.  

<ACTION>To Ford, Caius,and Sir Hugh. </ACTION> 

I do invite you tomorrow morning to my house to breakfast. After, we’ll a-birding together; I have a fine hawk for the bush. Shall it be so?		 

FORD  Anything. 

SIR HUGH If there is one, I shall make two in the company. 

DOCTOR CAIUS If there be one or two, I shall make-a the turd	.	 

FORD  Pray you, go, Master Page. 

<ACTION>Ford and Page exit.</ACTION> 

SIR HUGH I pray you now, remembrance tomorrow on the lousy knave mine Host. 

DOCTOR CAIUS Dat is good, by gar, with all my heart. 

SIR HUGH A lousy knave, to have his gibes and his	240 mockeries! 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
