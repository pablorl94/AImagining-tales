GOWER Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre, Welcomed and settled to his own desire. His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus, Unto Diana there ’s a votaress. Now to Marina bend your mind,	 Whom our fast-growing scene must find At Tarsus, and by Cleon trained In music, letters; who hath gained Of education all the grace Which makes high both the art and place Of general wonder. But, alack, That monster envy, oft the wrack Of earnèd praise, Marina’s life Seeks to take off by treason’s knife. And in this kind our Cleon hath	 One daughter and a full grown wench, Even ripe for marriage rite. This maid Hight Philoten, and it is said For certain in our story she Would ever with Marina be. Be ’t when they weaved the sleided silk With fingers long, small, white as milk; Or when she would with sharp needle wound The cambric, which she made more sound By hurting it; or when to the lute	 She sung, and made the night bird mute, That still records with moan; or when She would with rich and constant pen Vail to her mistress Dian, still This Philoten contends in skill	 With absolute Marina. So With the dove of Paphos might the crow Vie feathers white. 

Marina gets All praises, which are paid as debts And not as given.This so darks	 In Philoten all graceful marks That Cleon’s wife, with envy rare, A present murderer does prepare For good Marina, that her daughter Might stand peerless by this slaughter. The sooner her vile thoughts to stead, Lychorida, our nurse, is dead, And cursèd Dionyza hath The pregnant instrument of wrath Prest for this blow. The unborn event I do commend to your content. Only I carry wingèd Time Post on the lame feet of my rhyme, Which never could I so convey Unless your thoughts went on my way. Dionyza does appear, With Leonine, a murderer.
