Chapter 3.XXXIII. 

O blessed health! cried my father, making an exclamation, as he turned over the leaves to the next chapter, thou art before all gold and treasure; 'tis thou who enlargest the soul,--and openest all its powers to receive instruction and to relish virtue.--He that has thee, has little more to wish for;--and he that is so wretched as to want thee,--wants every thing with thee. 

I have concentrated all that can be said upon this important head, said my father, into a very little room, therefore we'll read the chapter quite through. 

My father read as follows: 

'The whole secret of health depending upon the due contention for mastery betwixt the radical heat and the radical moisture'--You have proved that matter of fact, I suppose, above, said Yorick. Sufficiently, replied my father. 

In saying this, my father shut the book,--not as if he resolved to read no more of it, for he kept his fore-finger in the chapter:--nor pettishly,--for he shut the book slowly; his thumb resting, when he had done it, upon the upper-side of the cover, as his three fingers supported the lower side of it, without the least compressive violence.-- 

I have demonstrated the truth of that point, quoth my father, nodding to Yorick, most sufficiently in the preceding chapter. 

Now could the man in the moon be told, that a man in the earth had wrote a chapter, sufficiently demonstrating, That the secret of all health depended upon the due contention for mastery betwixt the radical heat and the radical moisture,--and that he had managed the point so well, that there was not one single word wet or dry upon radical heat or radical moisture, throughout the whole chapter,--or a single syllable in it, pro or con, directly or indirectly, upon the contention betwixt these two powers in any part of the animal oeconomy-- 

'O thou eternal Maker of all beings!'--he would cry, striking his breast with his right hand (in case he had one)--'Thou whose power and goodness can enlarge the faculties of thy creatures to this infinite degree of excellence and perfection,--What have we Moonites done?'
