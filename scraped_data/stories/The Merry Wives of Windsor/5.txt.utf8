<ACTION>Enter Sir John Falstaff and Pistol.</ACTION> 

FALSTAFF I will not lend thee a penny. 

PISTOL Why then, the world’s mine oyster, which I with sword will open. 

FALSTAFF Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should lay my countenance to pawn. I have grated	 upon my good friends for three reprieves for you and your coach-fellow Nym, or else you had looked through the grate like a gemini of baboons. I am damned in hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends you were good soldiers and tall fellows.	 And when Mistress Bridget lost the handle of her fan, I took ’t upon mine honor thou hadst it not. 

PISTOL Didst not thou share? Hadst thou not fifteen pence? 

FALSTAFF Reason, you rogue, reason. Think’st thou I’ll	 endanger my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more about me. I am no gibbet for you. Go—a short knife and a throng—to your manor of Pickt-hatch, go. You’ll not bear a letter for me, you rogue? You stand upon your honor? Why, thou unconfinable	 baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the terms of my honor precise. Ay, ay, I myself sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand and hiding mine honor in my necessity, am fain to shuffle, to hedge, and to lurch; and yet you, rogue,	 will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your bold beating oaths under the shelter of your honor! You will not do it? You? 

PISTOL I do relent. What would thou more of man?	 

<ACTION>Enter Robin.</ACTION> 

ROBIN Sir, here’s a woman would speak with you. 

FALSTAFF Let her approach. 

<ACTION>Enter Mistress Quickly.</ACTION> 

MISTRESS QUICKLY Give your Worship good morrow. 

FALSTAFF Good morrow, goodwife. 

MISTRESS QUICKLY Not so, an ’t please your Worship.	 

FALSTAFF Good maid, then. 

MISTRESS QUICKLY I’ll be sworn—as my mother was, the first hour I was born. 

FALSTAFF I do believe the swearer. What with me? 

MISTRESS QUICKLY Shall I vouchsafe your Worship a	 word or two? 

FALSTAFF  Two thousand, fair woman, and I’ll vouchsafe thee the hearing. 

MISTRESS QUICKLY There is one Mistress Ford, sir—I pray, come a little nearer this ways. I myself dwell	 with Master Doctor Caius. 

FALSTAFF Well, on. “Mistress Ford,” you say— 

MISTRESS QUICKLY Your Worship says very true. I pray your Worship, come a little nearer this ways. 

FALSTAFF I warrant thee, nobody hears. Mine own	 people, mine own people. 

MISTRESS QUICKLY  Are they so? God bless them and make them His servants! 

FALSTAFF Well, “Mistress Ford”—what of her? 

MISTRESS QUICKLY Why, sir, she’s a good creature.	 Lord, Lord, your Worship’s a wanton! Well, heaven forgive you and all of us, I pray! 

FALSTAFF “Mistress Ford”—come, “Mistress Ford”— 

MISTRESS QUICKLY  Marry, this is the short and the long of it: you have brought her into such a canaries as	 ’tis wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when the court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her to such a canary. Yet there has been knights, and lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant you, coach after coach, letter after letter,	 gift after gift, smelling so sweetly—all musk—and so rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold, and in such alligant terms, and in such wine and sugar of the best and the fairest, that would have won any woman’s heart; and, I warrant you, they could	 never get an eye-wink of her. I had myself twenty angels given me this morning, but I defy all angels in any such sort, as they say, but in the way of honesty. And, I warrant you, they could never get her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of	 them all. And yet there has been earls—nay, which is more, pensioners—but, I warrant you, all is one with her. 

FALSTAFF But what says she to me? Be brief, my good she-Mercury.	 

MISTRESS QUICKLY Marry, she hath received your letter, for the which she thanks you a thousand times, and she gives you to notify that her husband will be absence from his house between ten and eleven. 

FALSTAFF Ten and eleven?	 

MISTRESS QUICKLY Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the picture, she says, that you wot of. Master Ford, her husband, will be from home. Alas, the sweet woman leads an ill life with him. He’s a very jealousy man. She leads a very frampold life with	 him, good heart. 

FALSTAFF  Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her. I will not fail her. 

MISTRESS QUICKLY  Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to your Worship. Mistress Page	 hath her hearty commendations to you too; and, let me tell you in your ear, she’s as fartuous a civil modest wife, and one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe’er be the other. And she bade me tell	 your Worship that her husband is seldom from home, but she hopes there will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon a man. Surely, I think you have charms, la! Yes, in truth. 

FALSTAFF  Not I, I assure thee. Setting the attraction of	 my good parts aside, I have no other charms. 

MISTRESS QUICKLY Blessing on your heart for ’t! 

FALSTAFF But I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford’s wife and Page’s wife acquainted each other how they love me?	 

MISTRESS QUICKLY That were a jest indeed! They have not so little grace, I hope. That were a trick indeed! But Mistress Page would desire you to send her your little page, of all loves. Her husband has a marvelous infection to the little page; and, truly,	 Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in Windsor leads a better life than she does. Do what she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go to bed when she list, rise when she list—all is as she will. And, truly, she deserves it, for if there be a	 kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must send her your page, no remedy. 

FALSTAFF  Why, I will. 

MISTRESS QUICKLY  Nay, but do so then, and, look you, he may come and go between you both. And in any	 case have a nayword, that you may know one another’s mind, and the boy never need to understand anything; for ’tis not good that children should know any wickedness. Old folks, you know, have discretion, as they say, and know the world.	 

FALSTAFF Fare thee well. Commend me to them both. There’s my purse.  <ACTION>He gives her money.</ACTION> I am yet thy debtor.—Boy, go along with this woman.  

<ACTION>Mistress Quickly and Robin exit. </ACTION> 

This news distracts me.		 

PISTOL , <ACTION> aside</ACTION> This punk is one of Cupid’s carriers. Clap on more sails, pursue; up with your fights; Give fire! She is my prize, or ocean whelm them all! 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

FALSTAFF Sayst thou so, old Jack? Go thy ways. I’ll make more of thy old body than I have done. Will	 they yet look after thee? Wilt thou, after the expense of so much money, be now a gainer? Good body, I thank thee. Let them say ’tis grossly done; so it be fairly done, no matter. 

<ACTION>Enter Bardolph with wine.</ACTION> 

BARDOLPH Sir John, there’s one Master Brook below	 would fain speak with you and be acquainted with you, and hath sent your Worship a morning’s draught of sack.  

<ACTION>He hands Falstaff the wine.</ACTION> 

FALSTAFF  Brook is his name? 

BARDOLPH Ay, sir.	 

FALSTAFF Call him in. Such Brooks are welcome to me that o’erflows such liquor.  

<ACTION>Bardolph exits.</ACTION> 

Ah ha, Mistress Ford and Mistress Page, have I encompassed you? Go to. Via! 

<ACTION>Enter Bardolph with Ford disguised as Brook.</ACTION> 

FORD , <ACTION> as Brook</ACTION> God bless you, sir.	 

FALSTAFF And you, sir. Would you speak with me? 

FORD , <ACTION> as Brook</ACTION> I make bold to press with so little preparation upon you. 

FALSTAFF You’re welcome. What’s your will?—Give us leave, drawer.	  

<ACTION>Bardolph exits.</ACTION> 

FORD , <ACTION> as Brook</ACTION> Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much. My name is Brook. 

FALSTAFF  Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you. 

FORD , <ACTION> as Brook</ACTION> Good Sir John, I sue for yours—not	 to charge you, for I must let you understand I think myself in better plight for a lender than you are, the which hath something emboldened me to this unseasoned intrusion; for they say, if money go before, all ways do lie open.	 

FALSTAFF Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on. 

FORD , <ACTION> as Brook </ACTION> Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me.  <ACTION>He sets it down.</ACTION> If you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or half, for easing me of the carriage.	 

FALSTAFF Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter. 

FORD , <ACTION> as Brook</ACTION> I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing. 

FALSTAFF  Speak, good Master Brook. I shall be glad	 to be your servant. 

FORD , <ACTION> as Brook</ACTION> Sir, I hear you are a scholar—I will be brief with you—and you have been a man long known to me, though I had never so good means as desire to make myself acquainted with you. I	 shall discover a thing to you wherein I must very much lay open mine own imperfection. But, good Sir John, as you have one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded, turn another into the register of your own, that I may pass with a reproof	 the easier, sith you yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender. 

FALSTAFF  Very well, sir. Proceed. 

FORD , <ACTION> as Brook</ACTION> There is a gentlewoman in this town—her husband’s name is Ford.	 

FALSTAFF Well, sir. 

FORD , <ACTION> as Brook</ACTION> I have long loved her and, I protest to you, bestowed much on her, followed her with a doting observance, engrossed opportunities to meet her, fee’d every slight occasion that could but	 niggardly give me sight of her, not only bought many presents to give her, but have given largely to many to know what she would have given. Briefly, I have pursued her as love hath pursued me, which hath been on the wing of all occasions. But whatsoever	 I have merited, either in my mind or in my means, meed I am sure I have received none, unless experience be a jewel. That I have purchased at an infinite rate, and that hath taught me to say this:		 “Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues, Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.” 

FALSTAFF Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?	 

FORD , <ACTION> as Brook</ACTION> Never. 

FALSTAFF Have you importuned her to such a purpose? 

FORD , <ACTION> as Brook</ACTION> Never. 

FALSTAFF Of what quality was your love, then?	 

FORD , <ACTION> as Brook </ACTION> Like a fair house built on another man’s ground, so that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where I erected it. 

FALSTAFF To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?		 

FORD , <ACTION> as Brook</ACTION> When I have told you that, I have told you all. Some say that though she appear honest to me, yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir John, here is the heart of my	 purpose: you are a gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your place and person, generally allowed for your many warlike, courtlike, and learned preparations.	 

FALSTAFF O, sir! 

FORD , <ACTION> as Brook</ACTION> Believe it, for you know it. There is money.  <ACTION>He points to the bag.</ACTION> Spend it, spend it, spend more; spend all I have. Only give me so much of your time in exchange of it as to lay an	 amiable siege to the honesty of this Ford’s wife. Use your art of wooing; win her to consent to you. If any man may, you may as soon as any. 

FALSTAFF Would it apply well to the vehemency of your affection that I should win what you would	 enjoy? Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously. 

FORD ,  <ACTION>as Brook </ACTION> O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on the excellency of her honor that the folly of my soul dares not present itself; she is too	 bright to be looked against. Now, could I come to her with any detection in my hand, my desires had instance and argument to commend themselves. I could drive her then from the ward of her purity, her reputation, her marriage vow, and a thousand	 other her defenses, which now are too too strongly embattled against me. What say you to ’t, Sir John? 

FALSTAFF , <ACTION> taking the bag</ACTION> Master Brook, I will first make bold with your money; next, give me your	 hand; and, last, as I am a gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford’s wife. 

FORD , <ACTION> as Brook</ACTION> O, good sir! 

FALSTAFF I say you shall. 

FORD , <ACTION> as Brook</ACTION> Want no money, Sir John; you shall	 want none. 

FALSTAFF Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her own appointment. Even as you came in to me, her assistant or go-between parted from me. I	 say I shall be with her between ten and eleven, for at that time the jealous, rascally knave her husband will be forth. Come you to me at night. You shall know how I speed. 

FORD ,  <ACTION>as Brook</ACTION> I am blessed in your acquaintance.	 Do you know Ford, sir? 

FALSTAFF Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not. Yet I wrong him to call him poor. They say the jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money, for the which his wife seems to me well-favored.	 I will use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue’s coffer, and there’s my harvest home. 

FORD ,  <ACTION>as Brook</ACTION> I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him if you saw him. 

FALSTAFF Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I	 will stare him out of his wits. I will awe him with my cudgel; it shall hang like a meteor o’er the cuckold’s horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night. Ford’s	 a knave, and I will aggravate his style. Thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and cuckold. Come to me soon at night.	 

<ACTION>Falstaff exits.</ACTION> 

FORD What a damned epicurean rascal is this! My heart is ready to crack with impatience. Who says	 this is improvident jealousy? My wife hath sent to him, the hour is fixed, the match is made. Would any man have thought this? See the hell of having a false woman: my bed shall be abused, my coffers ransacked, my reputation gnawn at. And	 I shall not only receive this villainous wrong but stand under the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that does me this wrong. Terms, names! “Amaimon” sounds well, “Lucifer” well, “Barbason” well; yet they are devils’ additions, the	 names of fiends. But “Cuckold,” “Wittoll,” “Cuckold”! The devil himself hath not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass. He will trust his wife, he will not be jealous. I will rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh the Welshman with my	310 cheese, an Irishman with my aquavitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling gelding, than my wife with herself. 

Then she plots, then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they think in their hearts they may effect, they will break their hearts	315 but they will effect.God be praised for my jealousy! Eleven o’clock the hour. I will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged on Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it. Better three hours too soon than a minute too late. Fie, fie, fie! Cuckold, cuckold,	 cuckold! 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
