<ACTION>Enter Cymbeline, Lords, Pisanio, and Attendants.</ACTION> 

CYMBELINE Again, and bring me word how ’tis with her. 

<ACTION>An Attendant exits.</ACTION> 

A fever, with the absence of her son; A madness, of which her life’s in danger. Heavens, How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen, The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen	 Upon a desperate bed, and in a time When fearful wars point at me; her son gone, So needful for this present. It strikes me past The hope of comfort.—But for thee, fellow, Who needs must know of her departure and	 Dost seem so ignorant, we’ll enforce it from thee By a sharp torture. 

PISANIO  Sir, my life is yours. I humbly set it at your will. But for my mistress, I nothing know where she remains, why gone,	 Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your Highness, Hold me your loyal servant. 

LORD Good my liege, The day that she was missing, he was here.	 I dare be bound he’s true and shall perform All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten, There wants no diligence in seeking him, And will no doubt be found. 

CYMBELINE The time is troublesome.	 To Pisanio. We’ll slip you for a season, but our jealousy Does yet depend. 

LORD  So please your Majesty, The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn, Are landed on your coast with a supply	 Of Roman gentlemen by the Senate sent. 

CYMBELINE Now for the counsel of my son and queen! I am amazed with matter. 

LORD Good my liege, Your preparation can affront no less	 Than what you hear of. Come more, for more you’re ready. The want is but to put those powers in motion That long to move. 

CYMBELINE I thank you. Let’s withdraw,	 And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not What can from Italy annoy us, but We grieve at chances here. Away. 

<ACTION>They exit. Pisanio remains.</ACTION> 

PISANIO I heard no letter from my master since I wrote him Imogen was slain. ’Tis strange.	 Nor hear I from my mistress, who did promise To yield me often tidings. Neither know I What is betid to Cloten, but remain Perplexed in all. The heavens still must work. Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.	 These present wars shall find I love my country, Even to the note o’ th’ King, or I’ll fall in them. All other doubts, by time let them be cleared. Fortune brings in some boats that are not steered. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
