(Note: In the Folger edition of the play that we're using here, this is still Act 1, Scene 1.) 

<ACTION>Enter the Queen, Posthumus, and Imogen.</ACTION> 

QUEEN No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter, After the slander of most stepmothers, Evil-eyed unto you. You’re my prisoner, but Your jailer shall deliver you the keys That lock up your restraint.—For you, Posthumus,	 So soon as I can win th’ offended king, I will be known your advocate. Marry, yet The fire of rage is in him, and ’twere good You leaned unto his sentence with what patience Your wisdom may inform you.	 

POSTHUMUS  Please your Highness, I will from hence today. 

QUEEN   You know the peril. I’ll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying The pangs of barred affections, though the King	 Hath charged you should not speak together.	She exits. 

IMOGEN  O, Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband, I something fear my father’s wrath, but nothing—	 Always reserved my holy duty—what His rage can do on me. You must be gone, And I shall here abide the hourly shot Of angry eyes, not comforted to live But that there is this jewel in the world	 That I may see again.	She weeps. 

POSTHUMUS My queen, my mistress! O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause To be suspected of more tenderness Than doth become a man. I will remain	 The loyal’st husband that did e’er plight troth. My residence in Rome at one Philario’s, Who to my father was a friend, to me Known but by letter; thither write, my queen, And with mine eyes I’ll drink the words you send,	 Though ink be made of gall. 

<ACTION>Enter Queen.</ACTION> 

QUEEN Be brief, I pray you. If the King come, I shall incur I know not How much of his displeasure. (Aside.) Yet I’ll move him		 To walk this way. I never do him wrong But he does buy my injuries, to be friends, Pays dear for my offenses.	She exits. 

POSTHUMUS Should we be taking leave As long a term as yet we have to live,	 The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu. 

IMOGEN Nay, stay a little! Were you but riding forth to air yourself, Such parting were too petty. Look here, love: This diamond was my mother’s.  <ACTION>(She offers a	ring.)</ACTION> Take it, heart, But keep it till you woo another wife When Imogen is dead. 

POSTHUMUS How, how? Another? You gentle gods, give me but this I have,	 And cere up my embracements from a next With bonds of death.	 <ACTION>(He puts the ring on his finger.)</ACTION> Remain, remain thou here, While sense can keep it on.—And sweetest, fairest, As I my poor self did exchange for you	 To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles I still win of you. For my sake, wear this. <ACTION>He offers a bracelet.</ACTION> It is a manacle of love. I’ll place it Upon this fairest prisoner.	 <ACTION>He puts it on her wrist.</ACTION> 

IMOGEN O the gods!	 When shall we see again? 

<ACTION>Enter Cymbeline and Lords.</ACTION> 

POSTHUMUS Alack, the King. 

CYMBELINE Thou basest thing, avoid hence, from my sight! If after this command thou fraught the court With thy unworthiness, thou diest. Away!	 Thou ’rt poison to my blood. 

POSTHUMUS The gods protect you, And bless the good remainders of the court. I am gone.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

IMOGEN There cannot be a pinch in death	 More sharp than this is. 

CYMBELINE O disloyal thing That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap’st A year’s age on me. 

IMOGEN I beseech you, sir,	 Harm not yourself with your vexation. I am senseless of your wrath. A touch more rare Subdues all pangs, all fears. 

CYMBELINE  Past grace? Obedience? 

IMOGEN Past hope and in despair; that way past grace.	 

CYMBELINE That mightst have had the sole son of my queen! 

IMOGEN O, blessèd that I might not! I chose an eagle And did avoid a puttock. 

CYMBELINE Thou took’st a beggar, wouldst have made my throne A seat for baseness.	 

IMOGEN  No, I rather added A luster to it. 

CYMBELINE O thou vile one! 

IMOGEN Sir, It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus.	 You bred him as my playfellow, and he is A man worth any woman, overbuys me Almost the sum he pays. 

CYMBELINE What, art thou mad? 

IMOGEN Almost, sir. Heaven restore me! Would I were	 A neatherd’s daughter, and my Leonatus Our neighbor shepherd’s son.	 <ACTION>She weeps.</ACTION> 

CYMBELINE Thou foolish thing! 

<ACTION>Enter Queen.</ACTION> 

They were again together. You have done Not after our command. Away with her	 And pen her up. 

QUEEN Beseech your patience.—Peace, Dear lady daughter, peace.—Sweet sovereign, Leave us to ourselves, and make yourself some comfort	 Out of your best advice. 

CYMBELINE  Nay, let her languish A drop of blood a day, and being aged Die of this folly.	 <ACTION>He exits, with Lords.</ACTION> 

QUEEN Fie, you must give way.	 

<ACTION>Enter Pisanio.</ACTION> 

Here is your servant.—How now, sir? What news? 

PISANIO My lord your son drew on my master. 

QUEEN   Ha? No harm, I trust, is done? 

PISANIO There might have been, But that my master rather played than fought And had no help of anger. They were parted By gentlemen at hand. 

QUEEN I am very glad on ’t. 

IMOGEN Your son’s my father’s friend; he takes his part	 To draw upon an exile. O, brave sir! I would they were in Afric both together, Myself by with a needle, that I might prick The goer-back.—Why came you from your master? 

PISANIO On his command. He would not suffer me	 To bring him to the haven, left these notes Of what commands I should be subject to When ’t pleased you to employ me. 

QUEEN, <ACTION>to Imogen</ACTION> This hath been Your faithful servant. I dare lay mine honor	 He will remain so. 

PISANIO I humbly thank your Highness. 

QUEEN, <ACTION>to Imogen</ACTION> Pray, walk awhile. 

IMOGEN , <ACTION> to Pisanio </ACTION> About some half hour hence, Pray you, speak with me. You shall at least	 Go see my lord aboard. For this time leave me. <ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
