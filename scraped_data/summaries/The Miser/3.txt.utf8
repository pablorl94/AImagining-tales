Now that La Flèche is gone, Harpagon is left alone on stage. He gives the audience a nice soliloquy (monologue) about how he doesn't trust La Flèche. Further, he talks about how a person can't be too careful with his money, since having money is the only thing that can make a person happy. Someone whose name rhymes with "Larpagon" needs to get his priorities straight.
