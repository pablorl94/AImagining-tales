<ACTION>Enter two Gentlemen, meeting one another, the FirstGentleman carrying a paper.</ACTION> 

FIRST GENTLEMAN You’re well met once again. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN  So are you. 

FIRST GENTLEMAN You come to take your stand here and behold The Lady Anne pass from her coronation? 

SECOND GENTLEMAN ’Tis all my business. At our last encounter, The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial. 

FIRST GENTLEMAN ’Tis very true. But that time offered sorrow, This general joy. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN ’Tis well. The citizens I am sure have shown at full their royal minds,	10 As, let ’em have their rights, they are ever forward In celebration of this day with shows, Pageants, and sights of honor. 

FIRST GENTLEMAN  Yes, ’tis the list Of those that claim their offices this day By custom of the coronation.	 The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims To be High Steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk, He to be Earl Marshal. You may read the rest. 

<ACTION>He offers him the paper.</ACTION> 

SECOND GENTLEMAN I thank you, sir. Had I not known those customs, I should have been beholding to your paper.	 But I beseech you, what’s become of Katherine, The Princess Dowager? How goes her business? 

FIRST GENTLEMAN That I can tell you too. The Archbishop Of Canterbury, accompanied with other Learnèd and reverend fathers of his order,	 Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles off From Ampthill, where the Princess lay, to which She was often cited by them, but appeared not; And, to be short, for not appearance and The King’s late scruple, by the main assent	 Of all these learnèd men she was divorced, And the late marriage made of none effect; Since which she was removed to Kymmalton, Where she remains now sick. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN Alas, good lady! 

<ACTION>Hautboys. A lively flourish of trumpets.The trumpets sound. Stand close. The Queen is coming.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Then, enter two Judges; Lord Chancellor, with purseand mace before him. Choristers singing. Music.Enter Mayor of London, bearing the mace. ThenGarter, in his coat of arms, and on his head he wore agilt copper crown.</ACTION> 

A royal train, believe me! These I know. 

<ACTION>Enter Marques Dorset, bearing a scepter of gold; on hishead a demi-coronal of gold. With him, the Earl ofSurrey, bearing the rod of silver with the dove, crownedwith an earl’s coronet. Collars of S’s.</ACTION> 

Who’s that that bears the scepter? 

FIRST GENTLEMAN Marques Dorset, And that the Earl of Surrey with the rod.	 

SECOND GENTLEMAN A bold brave gentleman. 

<ACTION>Enter Duke of Suffolk, in his robe of estate, hiscoronet on his head, bearing a long white wand, as HighSteward. With him, the Duke of Norfolk, with the rod ofMarshalship, a coronet on his head. Collars of S’s.</ACTION> 

That should be The Duke of Suffolk. 

FIRST GENTLEMAN ’Tis the same: High Steward. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN And that my Lord of Norfolk?	 

FIRST GENTLEMAN Yes. 

<ACTION>Enter a canopy, borne by four of the Cinque-ports,under it the Queen in her robe, in her hair, richlyadorned with pearl, crowned. On each side her, theBishops of London and Winchester.</ACTION> 

SECOND GENTLEMAN  Heaven bless thee! Thou hast the sweetest face I ever looked on.— Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel. Our king has all the Indies in his arms, And more, and richer, when he strains that lady. I cannot blame his conscience. 

FIRST GENTLEMAN  They that bear The cloth of honor over her are four barons Of the Cinque-ports.	 

SECOND GENTLEMAN Those men are happy, and so are all are near her. 

<ACTION>Enter the Old Duchess of Norfolk, in a coronal ofgold wrought with flowers, bearing the Queen’s train.Certain Ladies or Countesses, with plain circlets of goldwithout flowers.</ACTION> 

I take it she that carries up the train Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk. 

FIRST GENTLEMAN It is, and all the rest are countesses. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed.	 

FIRST GENTLEMAN And sometimes falling ones. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN No more of that. The Coronation procession exits, having passed over the stage in order and state, and then a great flourish of trumpets. 

<ACTION>Enter a third Gentleman.</ACTION> 

FIRST GENTLEMAN God save you, sir. Where have you been broiling? 

THIRD GENTLEMAN Among the crowd i’ th’ Abbey, where a finger Could not be wedged in more. I am stifled	 With the mere rankness of their joy. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN  You saw The ceremony? 

THIRD GENTLEMAN   That I did. 

FIRST GENTLEMAN How was it?	 

THIRD GENTLEMAN Well worth the seeing. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN Good sir, speak it to us! 

THIRD GENTLEMAN As well as I am able. The rich stream Of lords and ladies, having brought the Queen To a prepared place in the choir, fell off	 A distance from her, while her Grace sat down To rest awhile, some half an hour or so, In a rich chair of state, opposing freely The beauty of her person to the people. Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman	 That ever lay by man, which when the people Had the full view of, such a noise arose As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest— As loud and to as many tunes. Hats, cloaks, Doublets, I think, flew up, and had their faces	 Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy I never saw before. Great-bellied women That had not half a week to go, like rams In the old time of war, would shake the press And make ’em reel before ’em. No man living	 Could say “This is my wife there,” all were woven So strangely in one piece. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN But what followed? 

THIRD GENTLEMAN At length her Grace rose, and with modest paces Came to the altar, where she kneeled and saintlike	 Cast her fair eyes to heaven and prayed devoutly, Then rose again and bowed her to the people. When by the Archbishop of Canterbury She had all the royal makings of a queen— As, holy oil, Edward Confessor’s crown,	 The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems— Laid nobly on her; which performed, the choir, With all the choicest music of the kingdom, Together sung Te Deum. So she parted, And with the same full state paced back again	 To York Place, where the feast is held. 

FIRST GENTLEMAN Sir, You must no more call it “York Place”; that’s past, For since the Cardinal fell, that title’s lost. ’Tis now the King’s and called “Whitehall.”	 

THIRD GENTLEMAN I know it, But ’tis so lately altered that the old name Is fresh about me. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN  What two reverend bishops Were those that went on each side of the Queen?	 

THIRD GENTLEMAN Stokeley and Gardiner, the one of Winchester, Newly preferred from the King’s secretary, The other London. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN He of Winchester Is held no great good lover of the Archbishop’s,	 The virtuous Cranmer. 

THIRD GENTLEMAN  All the land knows that. However, yet there is no great breach. When it comes, Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN Who may that be, I pray you?	 

THIRD GENTLEMAN   Thomas Cromwell, A man in much esteem with th’ King, and truly A worthy friend. The King has made him Master o’ th’ Jewel House, And one already of the Privy Council.	 

SECOND GENTLEMAN He will deserve more. 

THIRD GENTLEMAN  Yes, without all doubt. Come, gentlemen, you shall go my way, Which is to th’ court, and there you shall be my guests,	 Something I can command. As I walk thither, I’ll tell you more. 

BOTH You may command us, sir. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
