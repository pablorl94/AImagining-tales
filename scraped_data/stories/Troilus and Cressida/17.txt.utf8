<ACTION>Enter Hector, armed, and Andromache.</ACTION> 

ANDROMACHE When was my lord so much ungently tempered To stop his ears against admonishment? Unarm, unarm, and do not fight today. 

HECTOR You train me to offend you. Get you in. By all the everlasting gods, I’ll go!	 

ANDROMACHE My dreams will sure prove ominous to the day. 

HECTOR No more, I say. 

<ACTION>Enter Cassandra.</ACTION> 

CASSANDRA Where is my brother Hector? 

ANDROMACHE Here, sister, armed and bloody in intent. Consort with me in loud and dear petition;	 Pursue we him on knees. For I have dreamt Of bloody turbulence, and this whole night Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter. 

CASSANDRA O, ’tis true! 

HECTOR ,  <ACTION>calling out</ACTION> Ho! Bid my trumpet sound!	 

CASSANDRA No notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother! 

HECTOR Begone, I say. The gods have heard me swear. 

CASSANDRA The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows. They are polluted off’rings more abhorred Than spotted livers in the sacrifice.	 

ANDROMACHE ,  <ACTION>to Hector</ACTION> O, be persuaded! Do not count it holy To hurt by being just. It is as lawful, For we would give much, to use violent thefts And rob in the behalf of charity. 

CASSANDRA It is the purpose that makes strong the vow,	 But vows to every purpose must not hold. Unarm, sweet Hector. 

HECTOR Hold you still, I say. Mine honor keeps the weather of my fate. Life every man holds dear, but the dear man	 Holds honor far more precious-dear than life. 

<ACTION>Enter Troilus, armed.</ACTION> 

How now, young man? Meanest thou to fight today? 

ANDROMACHE Cassandra, call my father to persuade. 

<ACTION>Cassandra exits.</ACTION> 

HECTOR No, faith, young Troilus, doff thy harness, youth. I am today i’ th’ vein of chivalry.	 Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong, And tempt not yet the brushes of the war. Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy, I’ll stand today for thee and me and Troy. 

TROILUS Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you	 Which better fits a lion than a man. 

HECTOR What vice is that? Good Troilus, chide me for it. 

TROILUS When many times the captive Grecian falls, Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword, You bid them rise and live.	 

HECTOR O, ’tis fair play. 

TROILUS Fool’s play, by heaven. Hector. 

HECTOR How now? How now? 

TROILUS For th’ love of all the gods, Let’s leave the hermit Pity with our mother,	 And when we have our armors buckled on, The venomed Vengeance ride upon our swords, Spur them to ruthful work, rein them from ruth. 

HECTOR Fie, savage, fie! 

TROILUS Hector, then ’tis wars.	 

HECTOR Troilus, I would not have you fight today. 

TROILUS Who should withhold me? Not fate, obedience, nor the hand of Mars, Beck’ning with fiery truncheon my retire; Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees,	 Their eyes o’er-gallèd with recourse of tears; Nor you, my brother, with your true sword drawn Opposed to hinder me, should stop my way, But by my ruin. 

<ACTION>Enter Priam and Cassandra.</ACTION> 

CASSANDRA ,  <ACTION>indicating Hector</ACTION> Lay hold upon him, Priam; hold him fast.	 He is thy crutch. Now if thou loose thy stay, Thou on him leaning, and all Troy on thee, Fall all together. 

PRIAM  Come, Hector, come. Go back. Thy wife hath dreamt, thy mother hath had visions,	 Cassandra doth foresee, and I myself Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt To tell thee that this day is ominous. Therefore, come back. 

HECTOR Aeneas is afield,	 And I do stand engaged to many Greeks, Even in the faith of valor, to appear This morning to them. 

PRIAM Ay, but thou shalt not go. 

HECTOR I must not break my faith.	 You know me dutiful; therefore, dear sir, Let me not shame respect, but give me leave To take that course by your consent and voice Which you do here forbid me, royal Priam. 

CASSANDRA O Priam, yield not to him!	 

ANDROMACHE Do not, dear father. 

HECTOR Andromache, I am offended with you. Upon the love you bear me, get you in. 

<ACTION>Andromache exits.</ACTION> 

TROILUS This foolish, dreaming, superstitious girl Makes all these bodements.	 

CASSANDRA O farewell, dear Hector. Look how thou diest! Look how thy eye turns pale! Look how thy wounds do bleed at many vents! Hark, how Troy roars, how Hecuba cries out, How poor Andromache shrills her dolor forth!	 Behold, distraction, frenzy, and amazement, Like witless antics, one another meet, And all cry “Hector! Hector’s dead! O, Hector!” 

TROILUS Away, away! 

CASSANDRA Farewell.—Yet soft! Hector, I take my leave.	 Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive.	 

<ACTION>She exits.</ACTION> 

HECTOR You are amazed, my liege, at her exclaim. Go in and cheer the town. We’ll forth and fight, Do deeds worth praise, and tell you them at night. 

PRIAM Farewell. The gods with safety stand about thee!	 

<ACTION>Hector and Priam exit at separate doors.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Alarum.</ACTION> 

TROILUS They are at it, hark! Proud Diomed, believe, I come to lose my arm or win my sleeve. 

<ACTION>Enter Pandarus, with a paper.</ACTION> 

PANDARUS  Do you hear, my lord? Do you hear? 

TROILUS  What now? 

PANDARUS Here’s a letter come from yond poor girl.	 

TROILUS Let me read.	 

<ACTION>He reads.</ACTION> 

PANDARUS A whoreson phthisic, a whoreson rascally phthisic so troubles me, and the foolish fortune of this girl, and what one thing, what another, that I shall leave you one o’ these days. And I have a	 rheum in mine eyes too, and such an ache in my bones that, unless a man were cursed, I cannot tell what to think on ’t.—What says she there? 

TROILUS Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart. Th’ effect doth operate another way.	 Go, wind, to wind! There turn and change together. 

<ACTION>He tears up the paper and throws the pieces in the air.</ACTION> 

My love with words and errors still she feeds, But edifies another with her deeds. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
