Chapter 2.VI. 

--Bless my soul!--my poor mistress is ready to faint--and her pains are gone--and the drops are done--and the bottle of julap is broke--and the nurse has cut her arm--(and I, my thumb, cried Dr. Slop,) and the child is where it was, continued Susannah,--and the midwife has fallen backwards upon the edge of the fender, and bruised her hip as black as your hat.--I'll look at it, quoth Dr Slop.--There is no need of that, replied Susannah,--you had better look at my mistress--but the midwife would gladly first give you an account how things are, so desires you would go up stairs and speak to her this moment. 

Human nature is the same in all professions. 

The midwife had just before been put over Dr. Slop's head--He had not digested it.--No, replied Dr. Slop, 'twould be full as proper if the midwife came down to me.--I like subordination, quoth my uncle Toby,--and but for it, after the reduction of Lisle, I know not what might have become of the garrison of Ghent, in the mutiny for bread, in the year Ten.--Nor, replied Dr. Slop, (parodying my uncle Toby's hobby-horsical reflection; though full as hobby-horsical himself)--do I know, Captain Shandy, what might have become of the garrison above stairs, in the mutiny and confusion I find all things are in at present, but for the subordination of fingers and thumbs to...--the application of which, Sir, under this accident of mine, comes in so a propos, that without it, the cut upon my thumb might have been felt by the Shandy family, as long as the Shandy family had a name.
