<ACTION>Flourish cornets. Enter the King of France with letters,two Lords, and divers Attendants.</ACTION> 

KING The Florentines and Senoys are by th’ ears, Have fought with equal fortune, and continue A braving war. 

FIRST LORD So ’tis reported, sir. 

KING Nay, ’tis most credible. We here receive it	 A certainty vouched from our cousin Austria, With caution that the Florentine will move us For speedy aid, wherein our dearest friend Prejudicates the business and would seem To have us make denial.	 

FIRST LORD His love and wisdom, Approved so to your Majesty, may plead For amplest credence. 

KING He hath armed our answer, And Florence is denied before he comes.	 Yet for our gentlemen that mean to see The Tuscan service, freely have they leave To stand on either part. 

SECOND LORD It well may serve A nursery to our gentry, who are sick	 For breathing and exploit. 

<ACTION>Enter Bertram, Lafew, and Parolles.</ACTION> 

KING What’s he comes here? 

FIRST LORD It is the Count Rossillion, my good lord, Young Bertram. 

KING Youth, thou bear’st thy father’s face.	 Frank nature, rather curious than in haste, Hath well composed thee. Thy father’s moral parts Mayst thou inherit too. Welcome to Paris. 

BERTRAM My thanks and duty are your Majesty’s. 

KING I would I had that corporal soundness now	 As when thy father and myself in friendship First tried our soldiership. He did look far Into the service of the time and was Discipled of the bravest. He lasted long, But on us both did haggish age steal on	 And wore us out of act. It much repairs me To talk of your good father. In his youth He had the wit which I can well observe Today in our young lords; but they may jest Till their own scorn return to them unnoted	 Ere they can hide their levity in honor. So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were, His equal had awaked them, and his honor, Clock to itself, knew the true minute when	 Exception bid him speak, and at this time His tongue obeyed his hand. Who were below him He used as creatures of another place And bowed his eminent top to their low ranks, Making them proud of his humility,	 In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man Might be a copy to these younger times, Which, followed well, would demonstrate them now But goers backward. 

BERTRAM His good remembrance, sir,	 Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb. So in approof lives not his epitaph As in your royal speech. 

KING Would I were with him! He would always say— Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words	 He scattered not in ears, but grafted them To grow there and to bear. “Let me not live”— This his good melancholy oft began On the catastrophe and heel of pastime, When it was out—“Let me not live,” quoth he,	 “After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses All but new things disdain, whose judgments are Mere fathers of their garments, whose constancies Expire before their fashions.” This he wished.	 I, after him, do after him wish too, Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home, I quickly were dissolvèd from my hive To give some laborers room. 

SECOND LORD You’re lovèd, sir.	 They that least lend it you shall lack you first. 

KING I fill a place, I know ’t.—How long is ’t, count, Since the physician at your father’s died? He was much famed. 

BERTRAM Some six months since, my lord.	 

KING If he were living, I would try him yet.— Lend me an arm.—The rest have worn me out With several applications. Nature and sickness Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count. My son’s no dearer.	 

BERTRAM  Thank your Majesty.
