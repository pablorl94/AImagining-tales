A "forlorn woman" is wandering down a crowded avenue. Surely, it must be Maggie—she's the definition of forlorn.

But wait… it isn't Maggie; it's Hattie. Apparently Jimmie has done his own number on a woman and now she's trying to track him down. It looks like Jimmie is no better than Pete after all, especially since he rejects her in an equally roguish way.

Back at Rum Alley: Maggie has returned home (she has nowhere else to go), and Mom is milking the opportunity to make Maggie feel like a rotten piece of you-know-what. Mary downright enjoys humiliating her daughter, while the denizens of Rum Alley turn the reunion into a spectacle.
