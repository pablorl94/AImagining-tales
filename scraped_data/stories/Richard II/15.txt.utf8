Scene 3 

<ACTION>Enter the King with his Nobles.</ACTION> 

KING HENRY Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son? ’Tis full three months since I did see him last. If any plague hang over us, ’tis he. I would to God, my lords, he might be found. Inquire at London, ’mongst the taverns there,	 For there, they say, he daily doth frequent With unrestrainèd loose companions, Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes And beat our watch and rob our passengers, While he, young wanton and effeminate boy,	 Takes on the point of honor to support So dissolute a crew. 

PERCY My lord, some two days since I saw the Prince, And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford. 

KING HENRY And what said the gallant?	 

PERCY His answer was, he would unto the stews, And from the common’st creature pluck a glove And wear it as a favor, and with that He would unhorse the lustiest challenger. 

KING HENRY As dissolute as desperate. Yet through both	 I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years May happily bring forth. But who comes here? 

<ACTION>Enter Aumerle amazed.</ACTION> 

AUMERLE Where is the King? 

KING HENRY What means our cousin, that he stares and looks so wildly? 

AUMERLE God save your Grace. I do beseech your Majesty To have some conference with your Grace alone. 

KING HENRY ,  <ACTION>to his Nobles</ACTION> Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone. 

<ACTION>The Nobles exit.</ACTION> 

What is the matter with our cousin now? 

AUMERLE ,  <ACTION>kneeling</ACTION> Forever may my knees grow to the earth, My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth, Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak. 

KING HENRY Intended or committed was this fault? If on the first, how heinous e’er it be, To win thy after-love I pardon thee.	 

AUMERLE ,  <ACTION>standing</ACTION> Then give me leave that I may turn the key That no man enter till my tale be done. 

KING HENRY Have thy desire.  

<ACTION>Aumerle locks the door.</ACTION> <ACTION>The Duke of York knocks at the door and crieth.</ACTION> 

YORK ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> My liege, beware! Look to thyself! Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there.	 

KING HENRY ,  <ACTION>to Aumerle</ACTION> Villain, I’ll make thee safe. 

<ACTION>He draws his sword.</ACTION> 

AUMERLE Stay thy revengeful hand. Thou hast no cause to fear. 

YORK ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> Open the door, secure, foolhardy king! Shall I for love speak treason to thy face? Open the door, or I will break it open.	 

<ACTION>King Henry unlocks the door.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter York.</ACTION> 

KING HENRY What is the matter, uncle? Speak. Recover breath. Tell us how near is danger That we may arm us to encounter it. 

YORK ,  <ACTION>giving King Henry a paper</ACTION> Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know The treason that my haste forbids me show. 

AUMERLE ,  <ACTION>to King Henry</ACTION> Remember, as thou read’st, thy promise passed. I do repent me. Read not my name there. My heart is not confederate with my hand. 

YORK It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.— I tore it from the traitor’s bosom, king.	 Fear, and not love, begets his penitence. Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove A serpent that will sting thee to the heart. 

KING HENRY O heinous, strong, and bold conspiracy! O loyal father of a treacherous son, Thou sheer, immaculate, and silver fountain From whence this stream, through muddy passages, Hath held his current and defiled himself, Thy overflow of good converts to bad, And thy abundant goodness shall excuse	 This deadly blot in thy digressing son. 

YORK So shall my virtue be his vice’s bawd, And he shall spend mine honor with his shame, As thriftless sons their scraping fathers’ gold. Mine honor lives when his dishonor dies,	 Or my shamed life in his dishonor lies. Thou kill’st me in his life: giving him breath, The traitor lives, the true man’s put to death. 

DUCHESS ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> What ho, my liege! For God’s sake, let me in! 

KING HENRY What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry?	 

DUCHESS ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> A woman and thy aunt, great king. ’Tis I. Speak with me, pity me. Open the door! A beggar begs that never begged before. 

KING HENRY Our scene is altered from a serious thing And now changed to “The Beggar and the King.”— My dangerous cousin, let your mother in. I know she is come to pray for your foul sin. 

<ACTION>Aumerle opens the door.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Duchess of York enters and kneels.</ACTION> 

YORK If thou do pardon whosoever pray, More sins for this forgiveness prosper may. This festered joint cut off, the rest rest sound. This let alone will all the rest confound. 

DUCHESS O king, believe not this hard-hearted man. Love loving not itself, none other can. 

YORK Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here? Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?	 

DUCHESS Sweet York, be patient.—Hear me, gentle liege. 

KING HENRY Rise up, good aunt. 

DUCHESS Not yet, I thee beseech. Forever will I walk upon my knees And never see day that the happy sees,	 Till thou give joy, until thou bid me joy By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy. 

AUMERLE ,  <ACTION>kneeling</ACTION> Unto my mother’s prayers I bend my knee. 

YORK ,  <ACTION>kneeling</ACTION> Against them both my true joints bended be. Ill mayst thou thrive if thou grant any grace.	 

DUCHESS Pleads he in earnest? Look upon his face. His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest; His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast. He prays but faintly and would be denied.	 We pray with heart and soul and all beside. His weary joints would gladly rise, I know. Our knees still kneel till to the ground they grow. His prayers are full of false hypocrisy, Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.	 Our prayers do outpray his. Then let them have That mercy which true prayer ought to have. 

KING HENRY Good aunt, stand up. 

DUCHESS Nay, do not say “stand up.” Say “pardon” first and afterwards “stand up.” An if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach, “Pardon” should be the first word of thy speech. I never longed to hear a word till now. Say “pardon,” king; let pity teach thee how. The word is short, but not so short as sweet.	 No word like “pardon” for kings’ mouths so meet. 

YORK Speak it in French, king. Say “pardonne moy.” 

DUCHESS Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy? Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord, That sets the word itself against the word!	 To King Henry. Speak “pardon” as ’tis current in our land; The chopping French we do not understand. Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there, Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear,	 That, hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce, Pity may move thee “pardon” to rehearse. 

KING HENRY Good aunt, stand up. 

DUCHESS I do not sue to stand. Pardon is all the suit I have in hand. 

KING HENRY I pardon him, as God shall pardon me. 

DUCHESS O, happy vantage of a kneeling knee! Yet am I sick for fear. Speak it again. Twice saying “pardon” doth not pardon twain,	 But makes one pardon strong. 

KING HENRY  I pardon him with all my heart. 

DUCHESS A god on Earth thou art. They all stand. 

KING HENRY But for our trusty brother-in-law and the Abbot, With all the rest of that consorted crew, Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels. Good uncle, help to order several powers To Oxford or where’er these traitors are. They shall not live within this world, I swear, But I will have them, if I once know where.	 Uncle, farewell,—and cousin, adieu. Your mother well hath prayed; and prove you true. 

DUCHESS ,  <ACTION>to Aumerle</ACTION> Come, my old son. I pray God make thee new. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
