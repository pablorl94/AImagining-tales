<ACTION>Enter Amiens, Jaques, and others.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Song.</ACTION> 

AMIENS <ACTION>sings</ACTION> "Under the greenwood tree Who loves to lie with me And turn his merry note Unto the sweet bird’s throat, Come hither, come hither, come hither.	 Here shall he see No enemy But winter and rough weather." 

JAQUES More, more, I prithee, more. 

AMIENS It will make you melancholy, Monsieur	 Jaques. 

JAQUES I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee, more. 

AMIENS My voice is ragged. I know I cannot please you.	 

JAQUES I do not desire you to please me. I do desire you to sing. Come, more, another stanzo. Call you ’em “stanzos”? 

AMIENS What you will, Monsieur Jaques. 

JAQUES Nay, I care not for their names. They owe me	 nothing. Will you sing? 

AMIENS More at your request than to please myself. 

JAQUES Well then, if ever I thank any man, I’ll thank you. But that they call “compliment” is like th’ encounter of two dog-apes. And when a man thanks	 me heartily, methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me the beggarly thanks. Come, sing. And you that will not, hold your tongues. 

AMIENS Well, I’ll end the song.—Sirs, cover the while; the Duke will drink under this tree.—He hath been	 all this day to look you. 

JAQUES And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is too disputable for my company. I think of as many matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no boast of them. Come, warble, come.	 

<ACTION>Song.</ACTION> 

ALL <ACTION>together here.</ACTION> "Who doth ambition shun And loves to live i’ th’ sun, Seeking the food he eats And pleased with what he gets, Come hither, come hither, come hither.	 Here shall he see No enemy But winter and rough weather." 

JAQUES I’ll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in despite of my invention.	 

AMIENS And I’ll sing it. 

JAQUES Thus it goes: "If it do come to pass That any man turn ass, Leaving his wealth and ease	 A stubborn will to please, Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame. Here shall he see Gross fools as he, An if he will come to me."  

AMIENS  What’s that “ducdame”? 

JAQUES ’Tis a Greek invocation to call fools into a circle. I’ll go sleep if I can. If I cannot, I’ll rail against all the first-born of Egypt. 

AMIENS  And I’ll go seek the Duke. His banquet is	 prepared. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
