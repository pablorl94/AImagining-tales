<ACTION>Enter the King in a chair, Warwick, Thomas Duke ofClarence, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, andAttendants.</ACTION> 

KING Now, lords, if God doth give successful end To this debate that bleedeth at our doors, We will our youth lead on to higher fields And draw no swords but what are sanctified. Our navy is addressed, our power collected,	 Our substitutes in absence well invested, And everything lies level to our wish. Only we want a little personal strength; And pause us till these rebels now afoot Come underneath the yoke of government.	 

WARWICK Both which we doubt not but your Majesty Shall soon enjoy. 

KING Humphrey, my son of Gloucester, where is the Prince your brother? 

HUMPHREY OF GLOUCESTER I think he’s gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.	 

KING And how accompanied? 

HUMPHREY OF GLOUCESTER I do not know, my lord. 

KING Is not his brother Thomas of Clarence with him? 

HUMPHREY OF GLOUCESTER No, my good lord, he is in presence here. 

THOMAS OF CLARENCE ,  <ACTION>coming forward </ACTION> What would  my lord and father? 

KING Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence. How chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother? He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas. Thou hast a better place in his affection Than all thy brothers. Cherish it, my boy, And noble offices thou mayst effect Of mediation, after I am dead, Between his greatness and thy other brethren. Therefore omit him not, blunt not his love, Nor lose the good advantage of his grace By seeming cold or careless of his will. For he is gracious if he be observed; He hath a tear for pity, and a hand	 Open as day for melting charity; Yet notwithstanding, being incensed he is flint, As humorous as winter, and as sudden As flaws congealèd in the spring of day. His temper therefore must be well observed. Chide him for faults, and do it reverently, When you perceive his blood inclined to mirth; But, being moody, give him time and scope Till that his passions, like a whale on ground, Confound themselves with working. 

Learn this,	 Thomas, And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends, A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in, That the united vessel of their blood, Mingled with venom of suggestion	 (As, force perforce, the age will pour it in), Shall never leak, though it do work as strong As aconitum or rash gunpowder.

THOMAS OF CLARENCE I shall observe him with all care and love. 

KING Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?	 

THOMAS OF CLARENCE He is not there today; he dines in London. 

KING And how accompanied? Canst thou tell that? 

THOMAS OF CLARENCE With Poins and other his continual followers. 

KING Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds, And he, the noble image of my youth,	 Is overspread with them; therefore my grief Stretches itself beyond the hour of death. The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape, In forms imaginary, th’ unguided days And rotten times that you shall look upon	 When I am sleeping with my ancestors. For when his headstrong riot hath no curb, When rage and hot blood are his counsellors, When means and lavish manners meet together, O, with what wings shall his affections fly	 Towards fronting peril and opposed decay! 

WARWICK My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite. The Prince but studies his companions Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language,	 ’Tis needful that the most immodest word Be looked upon and learned; which, once attained, Your Highness knows, comes to no further use But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms, The Prince will, in the perfectness of time,	 Cast off his followers, and their memory Shall as a pattern or a measure live, By which his Grace must mete the lives of others, Turning past evils to advantages. 

KING ’Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb	 In the dead carrion. 

<ACTION>Enter Westmoreland.</ACTION> 

Who’s here? Westmoreland? 

WESTMORELAND Health to my sovereign, and new happiness Added to that that I am to deliver. Prince John your son doth kiss your Grace’s hand.	 Mowbray, the Bishop Scroop, Hastings, and all Are brought to the correction of your law. There is not now a rebel’s sword unsheathed, But peace puts forth her olive everywhere. The manner how this action hath been borne	95 Here at more leisure may your Highness read With every course in his particular. He gives the King a paper. 

KING O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird, Which ever in the haunch of winter sings The lifting up of day.	 

<ACTION>Enter Harcourt.</ACTION> 

Look, here’s more news. 

HARCOURT From enemies heavens keep your Majesty, And when they stand against you, may they fall As those that I am come to tell you of. The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph,	 With a great power of English and of Scots, Are by the shrieve of Yorkshire overthrown. The manner and true order of the fight This packet, please it you, contains at large. <ACTION>He gives the King papers.</ACTION> 

KING And wherefore should these good news make me	 sick? Will Fortune never come with both hands full, But write her fair words still in foulest letters? She either gives a stomach and no food— Such are the poor, in health—or else a feast	 And takes away the stomach—such are the rich, That have abundance and enjoy it not. I should rejoice now at this happy news, And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy. O, me! Come near me, now I am much ill.	 

HUMPHREY OF GLOUCESTER Comfort, your Majesty. 

THOMAS OF CLARENCE O, my royal father! 

WESTMORELAND My sovereign lord, cheer up yourself, look up. 

WARWICK Be patient, princes. You do know these fits Are with his Highness very ordinary.	 Stand from him, give him air. He’ll straight be well. 

THOMAS OF CLARENCE No, no, he cannot long hold out these pangs. Th’ incessant care and labor of his mind Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in	 So thin that life looks through and will break out. 

HUMPHREY OF GLOUCESTER The people fear me, for they do observe Unfathered heirs and loathly births of nature. The seasons change their manners, as the year Had found some months asleep and leapt them	 over. 

THOMAS OF CLARENCE The river hath thrice flowed, no ebb between, And the old folk, time’s doting chronicles, Say it did so a little time before That our great-grandsire, Edward, sicked and died.	 

WARWICK Speak lower, princes, for the King recovers. 

HUMPHREY OF GLOUCESTER This apoplexy will certain be his end. 

KING I pray you take me up and bear me hence Into some other chamber. Softly, pray. 

<ACTION>The King is carried to a bed on anotherpart of the stage.</ACTION> 

Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends,	 Unless some dull and favorable hand Will whisper music to my weary spirit.
