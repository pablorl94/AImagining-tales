<ACTION>Enter Sebastian and Feste, the Fool.</ACTION> 

FOOL Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you? 

SEBASTIAN Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow. Let me be clear of thee. 

FOOL Well held out, i’ faith. No, I do not know you, nor	 I am not sent to you by my lady to bid you come speak with her, nor your name is not Master Cesario, nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so is so. 

SEBASTIAN I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else.	 Thou know’st not me. 

FOOL Vent my folly? He has heard that word of some great man and now applies it to a Fool. Vent my folly? I am afraid this great lubber the world will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy strangeness	 and tell me what I shall vent to my lady. Shall I vent to her that thou art coming? 

SEBASTIAN I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me. There’s money for thee. Giving money. If you tarry longer, I shall give worse payment.	 

FOOL By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men that give Fools money get themselves a good report—after fourteen years’ purchase. 

<ACTION>Enter Andrew, Toby, and Fabian. </ACTION> 

ANDREW ,  <ACTION>to Sebastian</ACTION> Now, sir, have I met you again? There’s for you.	 <ACTION>He strikes Sebastian.  </ACTION> 

SEBASTIAN ,  <ACTION>returning the blow</ACTION> Why, there’s for thee, and there, and there.—Are all the people mad? 

TOBY Hold, sir, or I’ll throw your dagger o’er the house. 

FOOL ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> This will I tell my lady straight. I would	 not be in some of your coats for twopence. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

TOBY ,  <ACTION>seizing Sebastian</ACTION> Come on, sir, hold! 

ANDREW Nay, let him alone. I’ll go another way to work with him. I’ll have an action of battery against him, if there be any law in Illyria. Though I struck	 him first, yet it’s no matter for that. 

SEBASTIAN ,  <ACTION>to Toby</ACTION> Let go thy hand! 

TOBY Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young soldier, put up your iron. You are well fleshed. Come on.	 

SEBASTIAN I will be free from thee. 

<ACTION>He pulls free and draws his sword.</ACTION> 

What wouldst thou now? If thou dar’st tempt me further, draw thy sword. 

TOBY What, what? Nay, then, I must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you.	 

<ACTION>He draws his sword.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Olivia.</ACTION> 

OLIVIA Hold, Toby! On thy life I charge thee, hold! 

TOBY Madam. 

OLIVIA Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch, Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves, Where manners ne’er were preached! Out of my	 sight!— Be not offended, dear Cesario.— Rudesby, begone!	 

<ACTION>Toby, Andrew, and Fabian exit.</ACTION> 

I prithee, gentle friend, Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway	 In this uncivil and unjust extent Against thy peace. Go with me to my house, And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks This ruffian hath botched up, that thou thereby Mayst smile at this. Thou shalt not choose but go.	 Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me! He started one poor heart of mine, in thee. 

SEBASTIAN ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> What relish is in this? How runs the stream? Or I am mad, or else this is a dream. Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;	 If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep! 

OLIVIA Nay, come, I prithee. Would thou ’dst be ruled by me! 

SEBASTIAN Madam, I will. 

OLIVIA O, say so, and so be!	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
