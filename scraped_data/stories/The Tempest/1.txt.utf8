<ACTION>Enter Prospero and Miranda.</ACTION> 

MIRANDA If by your art, my dearest father, you have Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them. The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, But that the sea, mounting to th’ welkin’s cheek, Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered	 With those that I saw suffer! A brave vessel, Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her, Dashed all to pieces. O, the cry did knock Against my very heart! Poor souls, they perished. Had I been any god of power, I would	 Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere It should the good ship so have swallowed, and The fraughting souls within her. 

PROSPERO Be collected. No more amazement. Tell your piteous heart	 There’s no harm done. 

MIRANDA O, woe the day! 

PROSPERO No harm. I have done nothing but in care of thee, Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who	 Art ignorant of what thou art, naught knowing Of whence I am, nor that I am more better Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell, And thy no greater father. 

MIRANDA More to know	 Did never meddle with my thoughts. 

PROSPERO ’Tis time I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand And pluck my magic garment from me. <ACTION>Putting aside his cloak.</ACTION> So,		 Lie there, my art.—Wipe thou thine eyes. Have comfort. The direful spectacle of the wrack, which touched The very virtue of compassion in thee, I have with such provision in mine art	 So safely ordered that there is no soul— No, not so much perdition as an hair, Betid to any creature in the vessel Which thou heard’st cry, which thou saw’st sink. Sit down,	 For thou must now know farther.	 <ACTION>They sit.</ACTION> 

MIRANDA You have often Begun to tell me what I am, but stopped And left me to a bootless inquisition, Concluding “Stay. Not yet.”	 

PROSPERO The hour’s now come. The very minute bids thee ope thine ear. Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell? I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not	 Out three years old. 

MIRANDA  Certainly, sir, I can. 

PROSPERO By what? By any other house or person? Of anything the image tell me that Hath kept with thy remembrance.	 

MIRANDA ’Tis far off And rather like a dream than an assurance That my remembrance warrants. Had I not Four or five women once that tended me? 

PROSPERO Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it	 That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else In the dark backward and abysm of time? If thou rememb’rest aught ere thou cam’st here, How thou cam’st here thou mayst. 

MIRANDA But that I do not.	 

PROSPERO Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since, Thy father was the Duke of Milan and A prince of power. 

MIRANDA Sir, are not you my father? 

PROSPERO Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and	 She said thou wast my daughter. And thy father Was Duke of Milan, and his only heir And princess no worse issued. 

MIRANDA O, the heavens! What foul play had we that we came from thence?	 Or blessèd was ’t we did? 

PROSPERO Both, both, my girl. By foul play, as thou sayst, were we heaved thence, But blessedly holp hither. 

MIRANDA O, my heart bleeds	 To think o’ th’ teen that I have turned you to, Which is from my remembrance. Please you, farther. 

PROSPERO My brother and thy uncle, called Antonio— I pray thee, mark me—that a brother should	 Be so perfidious!—he whom next thyself Of all the world I loved, and to him put The manage of my state, as at that time Through all the signories it was the first, And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed	 In dignity, and for the liberal arts Without a parallel. Those being all my study, The government I cast upon my brother And to my state grew stranger, being transported And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle—	 Dost thou attend me? 

MIRANDA Sir, most heedfully. 

PROSPERO Being once perfected how to grant suits, How to deny them, who t’ advance, and who To trash for overtopping, new created	 The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed ’em, Or else new formed ’em, having both the key Of officer and office, set all hearts i’ th’ state To what tune pleased his ear, that now he was The ivy which had hid my princely trunk	 And sucked my verdure out on ’t. Thou attend’st not. 

MIRANDA O, good sir, I do. 

PROSPERO I pray thee, mark me. I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated To closeness and the bettering of my mind	 With that which, but by being so retired, O’erprized all popular rate, in my false brother Awaked an evil nature, and my trust, Like a good parent, did beget of him A falsehood in its contrary as great	 As my trust was, which had indeed no limit, A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded, Not only with what my revenue yielded But what my power might else exact, like one Who, having into truth by telling of it,	 Made such a sinner of his memory To credit his own lie, he did believe He was indeed the Duke, out o’ th’ substitution And executing th’ outward face of royalty With all prerogative. Hence, his ambition growing—	 Dost thou hear? 

MIRANDA Your tale, sir, would cure deafness. 

PROSPERO To have no screen between this part he played And him he played it for, he needs will be Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library	 Was dukedom large enough. Of temporal royalties He thinks me now incapable; confederates, So dry he was for sway, wi’ th’ King of Naples To give him annual tribute, do him homage, Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend	 The dukedom, yet unbowed—alas, poor Milan!— To most ignoble stooping. 

MIRANDA O, the heavens! 

PROSPERO Mark his condition and th’ event. Then tell me If this might be a brother.	 

MIRANDA I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother. Good wombs have borne bad sons. 

PROSPERO Now the condition. This King of Naples, being an enemy	 To me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit, Which was that he, in lieu o’ th’ premises Of homage and I know not how much tribute, Should presently extirpate me and mine Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan,	 With all the honors, on my brother; whereon, A treacherous army levied, one midnight Fated to th’ purpose did Antonio open The gates of Milan, and i’ th’ dead of darkness The ministers for th’ purpose hurried thence	 Me and thy crying self. 

MIRANDA Alack, for pity! I, not rememb’ring how I cried out then, Will cry it o’er again. It is a hint That wrings mine eyes to ’t.	 

PROSPERO Hear a little further, And then I’ll bring thee to the present business Which now ’s upon ’s, without the which this story Were most impertinent. 

MIRANDA Wherefore did they not	 That hour destroy us? 

PROSPERO  Well demanded, wench. My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not, So dear the love my people bore me, nor set A mark so bloody on the business, but	 With colors fairer painted their foul ends. In few, they hurried us aboard a bark, Bore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigged, Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats	 Instinctively have quit it. There they hoist us To cry to th’ sea that roared to us, to sigh To th’ winds, whose pity, sighing back again, Did us but loving wrong. 

MIRANDA Alack, what trouble	 Was I then to you! 

PROSPERO O, a cherubin Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile, Infusèd with a fortitude from heaven, When I have decked the sea with drops full salt,	 Under my burden groaned, which raised in me An undergoing stomach to bear up Against what should ensue. 

MIRANDA How came we ashore? 

PROSPERO  By providence divine.	 Some food we had, and some fresh water, that A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo, Out of his charity, who being then appointed Master of this design, did give us, with Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries,	 Which since have steaded much. So, of his gentleness, Knowing I loved my books, he furnished me From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom.	 

MIRANDA Would I might But ever see that man. 

PROSPERO ,  <ACTION>standing </ACTION> Now I arise. Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow. Here in this island we arrived, and here	 Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit Than other princes can, that have more time For vainer hours and tutors not so careful. 

MIRANDA Heavens thank you for ’t. And now I pray you, sir— For still ’tis beating in my mind—your reason	 For raising this sea storm? 

PROSPERO Know thus far forth: By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune, Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies Brought to this shore; and by my prescience	 I find my zenith doth depend upon A most auspicious star, whose influence If now I court not, but omit, my fortunes Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions. Thou art inclined to sleep. ’Tis a good dullness,	 And give it way. I know thou canst not choose. 

<ACTION>Miranda falls asleep.Prospero puts on his cloak.</ACTION> 

Come away, servant, come. I am ready now. Approach, my Ariel. Come. 

<ACTION>Enter Ariel.</ACTION> 

ARIEL All hail, great master! Grave sir, hail! I come To answer thy best pleasure. Be ’t to fly,	 To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride On the curled clouds, to thy strong bidding task Ariel and all his quality. 

PROSPERO  Hast thou, spirit, Performed to point the tempest that I bade thee?	 

ARIEL To every article. I boarded the King’s ship; now on the beak, Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin, I flamed amazement. Sometimes I’d divide And burn in many places. On the topmast,	 The yards, and bowsprit would I flame distinctly, Then meet and join. Jove’s lightning, the precursors O’ th’ dreadful thunderclaps, more momentary And sight-outrunning were not. The fire and cracks Of sulfurous roaring the most mighty Neptune	 Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble, Yea, his dread trident shake. 

PROSPERO  My brave spirit! Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil Would not infect his reason?	 

ARIEL Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad, and played Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel, Then all afire with me. The King’s son, Ferdinand,	 With hair up-staring—then like reeds, not hair— Was the first man that leaped; cried “Hell is empty, And all the devils are here.” 

PROSPERO Why, that’s my spirit! But was not this nigh shore?	 

ARIEL Close by, my master. 

PROSPERO But are they, Ariel, safe? 

ARIEL Not a hair perished. On their sustaining garments not a blemish, But fresher than before; and, as thou bad’st me,	 In troops I have dispersed them ’bout the isle. The King’s son have I landed by himself, Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting, His arms in this sad knot.	He folds his arms.   

PROSPERO Of the King’s ship, The mariners say how thou hast disposed, And all the rest o’ th’ fleet. 

ARIEL Safely in harbor Is the King’s ship. In the deep nook, where once	 Thou called’st me up at midnight to fetch dew From the still-vexed Bermoothes, there she’s hid; The mariners all under hatches stowed, Who, with a charm joined to their suffered labor, I have left asleep. And for the rest o’ th’ fleet,	 Which I dispersed, they all have met again And are upon the Mediterranean float, Bound sadly home for Naples, Supposing that they saw the King’s ship wracked And his great person perish.	 

PROSPERO Ariel, thy charge Exactly is performed. But there’s more work. What is the time o’ th’ day? 

ARIEL Past the mid season. 

PROSPERO At least two glasses. The time ’twixt six and now	 Must by us both be spent most preciously. 

ARIEL Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains, Let me remember thee what thou hast promised, Which is not yet performed me. 

PROSPERO  How now? Moody?	 What is ’t thou canst demand? 

ARIEL My liberty. 

PROSPERO Before the time be out? No more. 

ARIEL I prithee, Remember I have done thee worthy service,	 Told thee no lies, made no mistakings, served Without or grudge or grumblings. Thou did promise To bate me a full year. 

PROSPERO Dost thou forget From what a torment I did free thee?	 

ARIEL No. 

PROSPERO Thou dost, and think’st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep, To run upon the sharp wind of the North, To do me business in the veins o’ th’ Earth	 When it is baked with frost. 

ARIEL I do not, sir. 

PROSPERO Thou liest, malignant thing. Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop? Hast thou forgot her?	 

ARIEL No, sir. 

PROSPERO Thou hast. Where was she born? Speak. Tell me. 

ARIEL Sir, in Argier. 

PROSPERO O, was she so? I must Once in a month recount what thou hast been,	 Which thou forget’st. This damned witch Sycorax, For mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing, from Argier, Thou know’st, was banished. For one thing she did They would not take her life. Is not this true?	 

ARIEL Ay, sir. 

PROSPERO This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child And here was left by th’ sailors. Thou, my slave, As thou report’st thyself, was then her servant, And for thou wast a spirit too delicate	 To act her earthy and abhorred commands, Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee, By help of her more potent ministers And in her most unmitigable rage, Into a cloven pine, within which rift	 Imprisoned thou didst painfully remain A dozen years; within which space she died And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans As fast as mill wheels strike. Then was this island (Save for the son that she did litter here,	 A freckled whelp, hag-born) not honored with A human shape. 

ARIEL Yes, Caliban, her son. 

PROSPERO Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know’st	 What torment I did find thee in. Thy groans Did make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts Of ever-angry bears. It was a torment To lay upon the damned, which Sycorax Could not again undo. It was mine art,	 When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape The pine and let thee out. 

ARIEL I thank thee, master. 

PROSPERO If thou more murmur’st, I will rend an oak And peg thee in his knotty entrails till	 Thou hast howled away twelve winters. 

ARIEL Pardon, master. I will be correspondent to command And do my spriting gently. 

PROSPERO Do so, and after two days	 I will discharge thee. 

ARIEL That’s my noble master. What shall I do? Say, what? What shall I do? 

PROSPERO Go make thyself like a nymph o’ th’ sea. Be subject To no sight but thine and mine, invisible	 To every eyeball else. Go, take this shape, And hither come in ’t. Go, hence with diligence! 

<ACTION>Ariel exits.</ACTION> 

Awake, dear heart, awake. Thou hast slept well. Awake.	 

<ACTION>Miranda wakes.</ACTION> 

MIRANDA The strangeness of your story put	 Heaviness in me. 

PROSPERO Shake it off. Come on, We’ll visit Caliban, my slave, who never Yields us kind answer. 

MIRANDA ,  <ACTION>rising</ACTION> ’Tis a villain, sir, 	  I do not love to look on. 

PROSPERO But, as ’tis, We cannot miss him. He does make our fire, Fetch in our wood, and serves in offices That profit us.—What ho, slave, Caliban!	 Thou earth, thou, speak! 

CALIBAN ,  <ACTION>within </ACTION> There’s wood enough within. 

PROSPERO Come forth, I say. There’s other business for thee. Come, thou tortoise. When? 

<ACTION>Enter Ariel like a water nymph.</ACTION> 

Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,	 Hark in thine ear.	 <ACTION>He whispers to Ariel.</ACTION> 

ARIEL My lord, it shall be done.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

PROSPERO ,  <ACTION>to Caliban</ACTION> Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself Upon thy wicked dam, come forth! 

<ACTION>Enter Caliban.</ACTION> 

CALIBAN As wicked dew as e’er my mother brushed	 With raven’s feather from unwholesome fen Drop on you both. A southwest blow on you And blister you all o’er. 

PROSPERO For this, be sure, tonight thou shalt have cramps, Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up. Urchins	 Shall forth at vast of night that they may work All exercise on thee. Thou shalt be pinched As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging Than bees that made ’em. 

CALIBAN  I must eat my dinner.	 This island’s mine by Sycorax, my mother, Which thou tak’st from me. When thou cam’st first, Thou strok’st me and made much of me, wouldst give me Water with berries in ’t, and teach me how	 To name the bigger light and how the less, That burn by day and night. And then I loved thee, And showed thee all the qualities o’ th’ isle, The fresh springs, brine pits, barren place and fertile.	 Cursed be I that did so! All the charms Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you, For I am all the subjects that you have, Which first was mine own king; and here you sty me In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me	 The rest o’ th’ island. 

PROSPERO Thou most lying slave, Whom stripes may move, not kindness, I have used thee, Filth as thou art, with humane care, and lodged	 thee In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate The honor of my child. 

CALIBAN O ho, O ho! Would ’t had been done! Thou didst prevent me. I had peopled else	 This isle with Calibans. 

MIRANDA Abhorrèd slave, Which any print of goodness wilt not take, Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee, Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each	 hour One thing or other. When thou didst not, savage, Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like A thing most brutish, I endowed thy purposes With words that made them known. But thy vile	 race, Though thou didst learn, had that in ’t which good natures Could not abide to be with. Therefore wast thou Deservedly confined into this rock,	 Who hadst deserved more than a prison. 

CALIBAN You taught me language, and my profit on ’t Is I know how to curse. The red plague rid you For learning me your language! 

PROSPERO Hagseed, hence!	 Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou ’rt best, To answer other business. Shrugg’st thou, malice? If thou neglect’st or dost unwillingly What I command, I’ll rack thee with old cramps, Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar	 That beasts shall tremble at thy din. 

CALIBAN No, pray thee. <ACTION>Aside.</ACTION> I must obey. His art is of such power It would control my dam’s god, Setebos, And make a vassal of him.	 

PROSPERO So, slave, hence. 

<ACTION>Caliban exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Ferdinand; and Ariel, invisible,playing and singing.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Song.</ACTION> ARIEL "Come unto these yellow sands, And then take hands. Curtsied when you have, and kissed The wild waves whist.	 Foot it featly here and there, And sweet sprites bear The burden. Hark, hark! <ACTION>	      Burden dispersedly, within:</ACTION> Bow-wow. The watchdogs bark.	 <ACTION>	      Burden dispersedly, within:</ACTION> Bow-wow. Hark, hark! I hear The strain of strutting chanticleer Cry cock-a-diddle-dow." 

FERDINAND Where should this music be? I’ th’ air, or th’ earth?	 It sounds no more; and sure it waits upon Some god o’ th’ island. Sitting on a bank, Weeping again the King my father’s wrack, This music crept by me upon the waters, Allaying both their fury and my passion	 With its sweet air. Thence I have followed it, Or it hath drawn me rather. But ’tis gone. No, it begins again. 

<ACTION>Song.</ACTION> ARIEL "Full fathom five thy father lies. Of his bones are coral made.	 Those are pearls that were his eyes. Nothing of him that doth fade But doth suffer a sea change Into something rich and strange. Sea nymphs hourly ring his knell.	 <ACTION>		Burden, within:</ACTION> Ding dong. Hark, now I hear them: ding dong bell." 

FERDINAND The ditty does remember my drowned father. This is no mortal business, nor no sound That the Earth owes. I hear it now above me.	 

PROSPERO , <ACTION> to Miranda</ACTION> The fringèd curtains of thine eye advance And say what thou seest yond. 

MIRANDA What is ’t? A spirit? Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir, It carries a brave form. But ’tis a spirit.	 

PROSPERO No, wench, it eats and sleeps and hath such senses As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest Was in the wrack; and, but he’s something stained With grief—that’s beauty’s canker—thou might’st call him	 A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows And strays about to find ’em. 

MIRANDA I might call him A thing divine, for nothing natural I ever saw so noble.	 

PROSPERO ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> It goes on, I see, As my soul prompts it. To Ariel. Spirit, fine spirit, I’ll free thee Within two days for this. 

FERDINAND ,  <ACTION>seeing Miranda </ACTION> Most sure, the goddess 	  On whom these airs attend!—Vouchsafe my prayer May know if you remain upon this island, And that you will some good instruction give How I may bear me here. My prime request, Which I do last pronounce, is—O you wonder!—	 If you be maid or no. 

MIRANDA No wonder, sir, But certainly a maid. 

FERDINAND My language! Heavens! I am the best of them that speak this speech,	 Were I but where ’tis spoken. 

PROSPERO How? The best? What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee? 

FERDINAND A single thing, as I am now, that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me,	 And that he does I weep. Myself am Naples, Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld The King my father wracked. 

MIRANDA Alack, for mercy! 

FERDINAND Yes, faith, and all his lords, the Duke of Milan	 And his brave son being twain. 

PROSPERO ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> The Duke of Milan And his more braver daughter could control thee, If now ’twere fit to do ’t. At the first sight They have changed eyes.—Delicate Ariel,	 I’ll set thee free for this.  <ACTION>To Ferdinand.</ACTION> A word, good sir. I fear you have done yourself some wrong. A word. 

MIRANDA Why speaks my father so ungently? This Is the third man that e’er I saw, the first	 That e’er I sighed for. Pity move my father To be inclined my way. 

FERDINAND  O, if a virgin, And your affection not gone forth, I’ll make you The Queen of Naples.	 

PROSPERO Soft, sir, one word more. <ACTION>Aside.</ACTION> They are both in either’s powers. But this swift business I must uneasy make, lest too light winning Make the prize light.  <ACTION>To Ferdinand.</ACTION> One word	 more. I charge thee That thou attend me. Thou dost here usurp The name thou ow’st not, and hast put thyself Upon this island as a spy, to win it From me, the lord on ’t.	 

FERDINAND No, as I am a man! 

MIRANDA There’s nothing ill can dwell in such a temple. If the ill spirit have so fair a house, Good things will strive to dwell with ’t. 

PROSPERO ,  <ACTION>to Ferdinand</ACTION> Follow me.	 <ACTION>To Miranda. </ACTION> Speak not you for him. He’s a traitor. <ACTION>To Ferdinand.</ACTION> Come, I’ll manacle thy neck and feet together. Sea water shalt thou drink. Thy food shall be The fresh-brook mussels, withered roots, and husks	 Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow. 

FERDINAND No, I will resist such entertainment till Mine enemy has more power. 

<ACTION>He draws, and is charmed from moving.</ACTION> 

MIRANDA O dear father,	 Make not too rash a trial of him, for He’s gentle and not fearful. 

PROSPERO  What, I say, My foot my tutor?—Put thy sword up, traitor, Who mak’st a show, but dar’st not strike, thy	 conscience Is so possessed with guilt. Come from thy ward, For I can here disarm thee with this stick And make thy weapon drop. 

MIRANDA  Beseech you, father—	 

PROSPERO Hence! Hang not on my garments. 

MIRANDA Sir, have pity. I’ll be his surety. 

PROSPERO Silence! One word more Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What,	 An advocate for an impostor? Hush. Thou think’st there is no more such shapes as he, Having seen but him and Caliban. Foolish wench, To th’ most of men this is a Caliban, And they to him are angels.	 

MIRANDA My affections Are then most humble. I have no ambition To see a goodlier man. 

PROSPERO ,  <ACTION>to Ferdinand</ACTION> Come on, obey. Thy nerves are in their infancy again	 And have no vigor in them. 

FERDINAND So they are. My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up. My father’s loss, the weakness which I feel, The wrack of all my friends, nor this man’s threats	 To whom I am subdued, are but light to me, Might I but through my prison once a day Behold this maid. All corners else o’ th’ Earth Let liberty make use of. Space enough Have I in such a prison.	 

PROSPERO ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> It works.—Come on.— Thou hast done well, fine Ariel.—Follow me. <ACTION>To Ariel. </ACTION> Hark what thou else shalt do me. 

MIRANDA ,  <ACTION>to Ferdinand</ACTION> Be of comfort.	 My father’s of a better nature, sir, Than he appears by speech. This is unwonted Which now came from him. 

PROSPERO ,  <ACTION>to Ariel</ACTION> Thou shalt be as free As mountain winds; but then exactly do	 All points of my command. 

ARIEL To th’ syllable. 

PROSPERO , <ACTION> to Ferdinand</ACTION> Come follow.  <ACTION>To Miranda. </ACTION> Speak not for him. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
