<ACTION>Enter Demetrius and Philo.</ACTION> 

PHILO Nay, but this dotage of our general’s O’erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes, That o’er the files and musters of the war Have glowed like plated Mars, now bend, now turn The office and devotion of their view	 Upon a tawny front. His captain’s heart, Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper And is become the bellows and the fan To cool a gypsy’s lust.	 

<ACTION>Flourish. Enter Antony, Cleopatra, her Ladies, the Train,with Eunuchs fanning her.</ACTION> 

Look where they come. Take but good note, and you shall see in him The triple pillar of the world transformed Into a strumpet’s fool. Behold and see. 

CLEOPATRA If it be love indeed, tell me how much.	 

ANTONY There’s beggary in the love that can be reckoned. 

CLEOPATRA I’ll set a bourn how far to be beloved. 

ANTONY Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new Earth. 

<ACTION>Enter a Messenger.</ACTION> 

MESSENGER News, my good lord, from Rome.	 

ANTONY Grates me, the sum. 

CLEOPATRA Nay, hear them, Antony. Fulvia perchance is angry. Or who knows If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent His powerful mandate to you: “Do this, or this;	 Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that. Perform ’t, or else we damn thee.” 

ANTONY How, my love? 

CLEOPATRA Perchance? Nay, and most like. You must not stay here longer; your dismission	 Is come from Caesar. Therefore hear it, Antony. Where’s Fulvia’s process? Caesar’s, I would say— both? Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt’s queen, Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine	 Is Caesar’s homager; else so thy cheek pays shame When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers! 

ANTONY Let Rome in Tiber melt and the wide arch Of the ranged empire fall. Here is my space. Kingdoms are clay. Our dungy earth alike	 Feeds beast as man. The nobleness of life Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair And such a twain can do ’t, in which I bind, On pain of punishment, the world to weet We stand up peerless.	 

CLEOPATRA  Excellent falsehood! Why did he marry Fulvia and not love her? I’ll seem the fool I am not. Antony Will be himself. 

ANTONY But stirred by Cleopatra.	 Now for the love of Love and her soft hours, Let’s not confound the time with conference harsh. There’s not a minute of our lives should stretch Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight? 

CLEOPATRA Hear the ambassadors.	 

ANTONY  Fie, wrangling queen, Whom everything becomes—to chide, to laugh, To weep; whose every passion fully strives To make itself, in thee, fair and admired! No messenger but thine, and all alone	 Tonight we’ll wander through the streets and note The qualities of people. Come, my queen, Last night you did desire it.  <ACTION>To the Messenger.</ACTION> Speak not to us. 

<ACTION>Antony and Cleopatra exit with the Train.</ACTION> 

DEMETRIUS Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?	 

PHILO Sir, sometimes when he is not Antony He comes too short of that great property Which still should go with Antony. 

DEMETRIUS I am full sorry That he approves the common liar who	 Thus speaks of him at Rome; but I will hope Of better deeds tomorrow. Rest you happy! 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
