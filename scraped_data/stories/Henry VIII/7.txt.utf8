<ACTION>Enter Anne Bullen and an old Lady.</ACTION> 

ANNE Not for that neither. Here’s the pang that pinches: His Highness having lived so long with her, and she So good a lady that no tongue could ever Pronounce dishonor of her—by my life, She never knew harm-doing!—O, now, after	 So many courses of the sun enthroned, Still growing in a majesty and pomp, the which To leave a thousandfold more bitter than ’Tis sweet at first t’ acquire—after this process, To give her the avaunt! It is a pity	 Would move a monster. 

OLD LADY Hearts of most hard temper Melt and lament for her. 

ANNE   O, God’s will! Much better She ne’er had known pomp; though ’t be temporal,	 Yet if that quarrel, Fortune, do divorce It from the bearer, ’tis a sufferance panging As soul and body’s severing. 

OLD LADY Alas, poor lady, She’s a stranger now again!	 

ANNE So much the more Must pity drop upon her. Verily, I swear, ’tis better to be lowly born And range with humble livers in content Than to be perked up in a glist’ring grief	 And wear a golden sorrow. 

OLD LADY Our content Is our best having. 

ANNE By my troth and maidenhead, I would not be a queen. 

OLD LADY  Beshrew me, I would, And venture maidenhead for ’t; and so would you, For all this spice of your hypocrisy. You, that have so fair parts of woman on you, Have too a woman’s heart, which ever yet	 Affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty; Which, to say sooth, are blessings; and which gifts, Saving your mincing, the capacity Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive If you might please to stretch it. 

ANNE Nay, good troth. 

OLD LADY Yes, troth, and troth. You would not be a queen? 

ANNE No, not for all the riches under heaven. 

OLD LADY ’Tis strange. A threepence bowed would hire me, Old as I am, to queen it. But I pray you, What think you of a duchess? Have you limbs To bear that load of title? 

ANNE No, in truth. 

OLD LADY Then you are weakly made. Pluck off a little. I would not be a young count in your way	 For more than blushing comes to. If your back Cannot vouchsafe this burden, ’tis too weak Ever to get a boy. 

ANNE  How you do talk! I swear again, I would not be a queen	 For all the world. 

OLD LADY In faith, for little England You’d venture an emballing. I myself Would for Carnarvanshire, although there longed No more to th’ crown but that. Lo, who comes here?	 

<ACTION>Enter Lord Chamberlain.</ACTION> 

CHAMBERLAIN Good morrow, ladies. What were ’t worth to know The secret of your conference? 

ANNE  My good lord, Not your demand; it values not your asking. Our mistress’ sorrows we were pitying.	 

CHAMBERLAIN It was a gentle business, and becoming The action of good women. There is hope All will be well. 

ANNE Now, I pray God, amen! 

CHAMBERLAIN You bear a gentle mind, and heav’nly blessings	 Follow such creatures. That you may, fair lady, Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note’s Ta’en of your many virtues, the King’s Majesty Commends his good opinion of you to you, and Does purpose honor to you no less flowing	 Than Marchioness of Pembroke, to which title A thousand pound a year annual support Out of his grace he adds. 

ANNE I do not know What kind of my obedience I should tender.	 More than my all is nothing, nor my prayers Are not words duly hallowed, nor my wishes More worth than empty vanities. Yet prayers and wishes Are all I can return. ’Beseech your Lordship,	 Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience, As from a blushing handmaid, to his Highness, Whose health and royalty I pray for. 

CHAMBERLAIN  Lady, I shall not fail t’ approve the fair conceit	 The King hath of you.  <ACTION>(Aside.)</ACTION> I have perused her well. Beauty and honor in her are so mingled That they have caught the King. And who knows yet But from this lady may proceed a gem	 To lighten all this isle?—I’ll to the King And say I spoke with you. 

ANNE  My honored lord. 

<ACTION>Lord Chamberlain exits.</ACTION> 

OLD LADY Why, this it is! See, see! I have been begging sixteen years in court,	 Am yet a courtier beggarly, nor could Come pat betwixt too early and too late For any suit of pounds; and you—O, fate!— A very fresh fish here—fie, fie, fie upon This compelled fortune!—have your mouth filled up	 Before you open it. 

ANNE This is strange to me. 

OLD LADY How tastes it? Is it bitter? Forty pence, no. There was a lady once—’tis an old story— That would not be a queen, that would she not, For all the mud in Egypt. Have you heard it? 

ANNE Come, you are pleasant. 

OLD LADY With your theme, I could O’ermount the lark. The Marchioness of Pembroke? A thousand pounds a year for pure respect?	 No other obligation? By my life, That promises more thousands; honor’s train Is longer than his foreskirt. By this time I know your back will bear a duchess. Say, Are you not stronger than you were?	 

ANNE  Good lady, Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy, And leave me out on ’t. Would I had no being If this salute my blood a jot. It faints me To think what follows.	 The Queen is comfortless and we forgetful In our long absence. Pray do not deliver What here you’ve heard to her. 

OLD LADY What do you think me? 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
