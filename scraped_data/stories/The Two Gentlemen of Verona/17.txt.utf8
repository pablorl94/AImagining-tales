<ACTION>Enter Thurio, Proteus, and Julia, disguised asSebastian.</ACTION> 

THURIO Sir Proteus, what says Sylvia to my suit? 

PROTEUS O sir, I find her milder than she was, And yet she takes exceptions at your person. 

THURIO What? That my leg is too long? 

PROTEUS No, that it is too little.	 

THURIO I’ll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder. 

JULIA , <ACTION> aside</ACTION> But love will not be spurred to what it loathes. 

THURIO What says she to my face? 

PROTEUS She says it is a fair one. 

THURIO Nay, then the wanton lies; my face is black.	 

PROTEUS But pearls are fair, and the old saying is, Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies’ eyes. 

JULIA , <ACTION> aside</ACTION> ’Tis true, such pearls as put out ladies’ eyes, For I had rather wink than look on them. 

THURIO How likes she my discourse?	 

PROTEUS Ill, when you talk of war. 

THURIO But well when I discourse of love and peace. 

JULIA , <ACTION> aside</ACTION> But better, indeed, when you hold your peace. 

THURIO What says she to my valor? 

PROTEUS O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.	 

JULIA , <ACTION> aside</ACTION> She needs not when she knows it cowardice. 

THURIO What says she to my birth? 

PROTEUS That you are well derived. 

JULIA , <ACTION> aside</ACTION> True, from a gentleman to a fool. 

THURIO Considers she my possessions?	 

PROTEUS O, ay, and pities them. 

THURIO Wherefore? 

JULIA ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> That such an ass should owe them. 

PROTEUS That they are out by lease. 

JULIA ,  <ACTION>as Sebastian</ACTION> Here comes the Duke.	 

<ACTION>Enter Duke.</ACTION> 

DUKE How now, Sir Proteus?—How now, Thurio? Which of you saw Eglamour of late? 

THURIO Not I. 

PROTEUS Nor I. 

DUKE Saw you my daughter?	 

PROTEUS Neither. 

DUKE Why, then, she’s fled unto that peasant, Valentine, And Eglamour is in her company. ’Tis true, for Friar Lawrence met them both As he, in penance, wandered through the forest;	 Him he knew well and guessed that it was she, But, being masked, he was not sure of it. Besides, she did intend confession At Patrick’s cell this even, and there she was not. These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.	 Therefore I pray you stand not to discourse, But mount you presently and meet with me Upon the rising of the mountain foot That leads toward Mantua, whither they are fled. Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

THURIO Why, this it is to be a peevish girl That flies her fortune when it follows her. I’ll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour Than for the love of reckless Sylvia.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

PROTEUS And I will follow, more for Sylvia’s love	 Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

JULIA And I will follow, more to cross that love Than hate for Sylvia, that is gone for love. 

<ACTION>She exits.</ACTION>
