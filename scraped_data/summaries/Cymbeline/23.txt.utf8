At the Roman camp, Posthumus enters and talks to a bloody cloth. We're not kidding, folks: he got it from Pisanio as "proof" of Imogen's death.

Posthumus feels really bad about Imogen's death. He wishes his servant wouldn't have obeyed him.

Posthumus tells us that he's been roped into fighting against the British because he's a Roman resident.

Well, forget that: Posthumus doesn't want to live with any regrets, so he swaps out his Roman uniform for a British one. That way, he won't have to fight against his homeland.

Posthumus hopes he can be strong and valiant on the battlefield.
