CHAPTER VI 

Newman gave up Damascus and Bagdad and returned to Paris before the autumn was over. He established himself in some rooms selected for him by Tom Tristram, in accordance with the latter’s estimate of what he called his social position. When Newman learned that his social position was to be taken into account, he professed himself utterly incompetent, and begged Tristram to relieve him of the care. “I didn’t know I had a social position,” he said, “and if I have, I haven’t the smallest idea what it is. Isn’t a social position knowing some two or three thousand people and inviting them to dinner? I know you and your wife and little old Mr. Nioche, who gave me French lessons last spring. Can I invite you to dinner to meet each other? If I can, you must come to-morrow.” 

“That is not very grateful to me,” said Mrs. Tristram, “who introduced you last year to every creature I know.” 

“So you did; I had quite forgotten. But I thought you wanted me to forget,” said Newman, with that tone of simple deliberateness which frequently marked his utterance, and which an observer would not have known whether to pronounce a somewhat mysteriously humorous affection of ignorance or a modest aspiration to knowledge; “you told me you disliked them all.” 

“Ah, the way you remember what I say is at least very flattering. But in future,” added Mrs. Tristram, “pray forget all the wicked things and remember only the good ones. It will be easily done, and it will not fatigue your memory. But I forewarn you that if you trust my husband to pick out your rooms, you are in for something hideous.” 

“Hideous, darling?” cried Tristram. 

“To-day I must say nothing wicked; otherwise I should use stronger language.” 

“What do you think she would say, Newman?” asked Tristram. “If she really tried, now? She can express displeasure, volubly, in two or three languages; that’s what it is to be intellectual. It gives her the start of me completely, for I can’t swear, for the life of me, except in English. When I get mad I have to fall back on our dear old mother tongue. There’s nothing like it, after all.” 

Newman declared that he knew nothing about tables and chairs, and that he would accept, in the way of a lodging, with his eyes shut, anything that Tristram should offer him. This was partly veracity on our hero’s part, but it was also partly charity. He knew that to pry about and look at rooms, and make people open windows, and poke into sofas with his cane, and gossip with landladies, and ask who lived above and who below--he knew that this was of all pastimes the dearest to Tristram’s heart, and he felt the more disposed to put it in his way as he was conscious that, as regards his obliging friend, he had suffered the warmth of ancient good-fellowship somewhat to abate. Besides, he had no taste for upholstery; he had even no very exquisite sense of comfort or convenience. He had a relish for luxury and splendor, but it was satisfied by rather gross contrivances. He scarcely knew a hard chair from a soft one, and he possessed a talent for stretching his legs which quite dispensed with adventitious facilities. 

His idea of comfort was to inhabit very large rooms, have a great many of them, and be conscious of their possessing a number of patented mechanical devices--half of which he should never have occasion to use.The apartments should be light and brilliant and lofty; he had once said that he liked rooms in which you wanted to keep your hat on. For the rest, he was satisfied with the assurance of any respectable person that everything was “handsome.” Tristram accordingly secured for him an apartment to which this epithet might be lavishly applied. It was situated on the Boulevard Haussmann, on the first floor, and consisted of a series of rooms, gilded from floor to ceiling a foot thick, draped in various light shades of satin, and chiefly furnished with mirrors and clocks. Newman thought them magnificent, thanked Tristram heartily, immediately took possession, and had one of his trunks standing for three months in his drawing-room. 

One day Mrs. Tristram told him that her beautiful friend, Madame de Cintré, had returned from the country; that she had met her three days before, coming out of the Church of St. Sulpice; she herself having journeyed to that distant quarter in quest of an obscure lace-mender, of whose skill she had heard high praise. 

“And how were those eyes?” Newman asked. 

“Those eyes were red with weeping, if you please!” said Mrs. Tristram. “She had been to confession.” 

“It doesn’t tally with your account of her,” said Newman, “that she should have sins to confess.” 

“They were not sins; they were sufferings.” 

“How do you know that?” 

“She asked me to come and see her; I went this morning.” 

“And what does she suffer from?” 

“I didn’t ask her. With her, somehow, one is very discreet. But I guessed, easily enough. She suffers from her wicked old mother and her Grand Turk of a brother. They persecute her. But I can almost forgive them, because, as I told you, she is a saint, and a persecution is all that she needs to bring out her saintliness and make her perfect.” 

“That’s a comfortable theory for her. I hope you will never impart it to the old folks. Why does she let them bully her? Is she not her own mistress?” 

“Legally, yes, I suppose; but morally, no. In France you must never say nay to your mother, whatever she requires of you. She may be the most abominable old woman in the world, and make your life a purgatory; but, after all, she is _ma mère_, and you have no right to judge her. You have simply to obey. The thing has a fine side to it. Madame de Cintré bows her head and folds her wings.” 

“Can’t she at least make her brother leave off?” 

“Her brother is the _chef de la famille_, as they say; he is the head of the clan. With those people the family is everything; you must act, not for your own pleasure, but for the advantage of the family.” 

“I wonder what _my_ family would like me to do!” exclaimed Tristram. 

“I wish you had one!” said his wife. 

“But what do they want to get out of that poor lady?” Newman asked. 

“Another marriage. They are not rich, and they want to bring more money into the family.” 

“There’s your chance, my boy!” said Tristram. 

“And Madame de Cintré objects,” Newman continued. 

“She has been sold once; she naturally objects to being sold again. It appears that the first time they made rather a poor bargain; M. de Cintré left a scanty property.” 

“And to whom do they want to marry her now?” 

“I thought it best not to ask; but you may be sure it is to some horrid old nabob, or to some dissipated little duke.” 

“There’s Mrs. Tristram, as large as life!” cried her husband. “Observe the richness of her imagination. She has not a single question--it’s vulgar to ask questions--and yet she knows everything. She has the history of Madame de Cintré’s marriage at her fingers’ ends. She has seen the lovely Claire on her knees, with loosened tresses and streaming eyes, and the rest of them standing over her with spikes and goads and red-hot irons, ready to come down on her if she refuses the tipsy duke. The simple truth is that they made a fuss about her milliner’s bill or refused her an opera-box.” 

Newman looked from Tristram to his wife with a certain mistrust in each direction. “Do you really mean,” he asked of Mrs. Tristram, “that your friend is being forced into an unhappy marriage?” 

“I think it extremely probable. Those people are very capable of that sort of thing.” 

“It is like something in a play,” said Newman; “that dark old house over there looks as if wicked things had been done in it, and might be done again.” 

“They have a still darker old house in the country Madame de Cintré tells me, and there, during the summer this scheme must have been hatched.” 

“_Must_ have been; mind that!” said Tristram. 

“After all,” suggested Newman, after a silence, “she may be in trouble about something else.” 

“If it is something else, then it is something worse,” said Mrs. Tristram, with rich decision. 

Newman was silent a while, and seemed lost in meditation. “Is it possible,” he asked at last, “that they do that sort of thing over here? that helpless women are bullied into marrying men they hate?” 

“Helpless women, all over the world, have a hard time of it,” said Mrs. Tristram. “There is plenty of bullying everywhere.” 

“A great deal of that kind of thing goes on in New York,” said Tristram. “Girls are bullied or coaxed or bribed, or all three together, into marrying nasty fellows. There is no end of that always going on in the Fifth Avenue, and other bad things besides. The Mysteries of the Fifth Avenue! Someone ought to show them up.” 

“I don’t believe it!” said Newman, very gravely. “I don’t believe that, in America, girls are ever subjected to compulsion. I don’t believe there have been a dozen cases of it since the country began.” 

“Listen to the voice of the spread eagle!” cried Tristram. 

“The spread eagle ought to use his wings,” said Mrs. Tristram. “Fly to the rescue of Madame de Cintré!” 

“To her rescue?” 

“Pounce down, seize her in your talons, and carry her off. Marry her yourself.” 

Newman, for some moments, answered nothing; but presently, “I should suppose she had heard enough of marrying,” he said. “The kindest way to treat her would be to admire her, and yet never to speak of it. But that sort of thing is infamous,” he added; “it makes me feel savage to hear of it.” 

He heard of it, however, more than once afterward. Mrs. Tristram again saw Madame de Cintré, and again found her looking very sad. But on these occasions there had been no tears; her beautiful eyes were clear and still. “She is cold, calm, and hopeless,” Mrs. Tristram declared, and she added that on her mentioning that her friend Mr. Newman was again in Paris and was faithful in his desire to make Madame de Cintré’s acquaintance, this lovely woman had found a smile in her despair, and declared that she was sorry to have missed his visit in the spring and that she hoped he had not lost courage. “I told her something about you,” said Mrs. Tristram. 

“That’s a comfort,” said Newman, placidly. “I like people to know about me.” 

A few days after this, one dusky autumn afternoon, he went again to the Rue de l’Université. The early evening had closed in as he applied for admittance at the stoutly guarded _Hôtel de Bellegarde_. He was told that Madame de Cintré was at home; he crossed the court, entered the farther door, and was conducted through a vestibule, vast, dim, and cold, up a broad stone staircase with an ancient iron balustrade, to an apartment on the second floor. Announced and ushered in, he found himself in a sort of paneled boudoir, at one end of which a lady and gentleman were seated before the fire. The gentleman was smoking a cigarette; there was no light in the room save that of a couple of candles and the glow from the hearth. Both persons rose to welcome Newman, who, in the firelight, recognized Madame de Cintré. She gave him her hand with a smile which seemed in itself an illumination, and, pointing to her companion, said softly, “My brother.” The gentleman offered Newman a frank, friendly greeting, and our hero then perceived him to be the young man who had spoken to him in the court of the hotel on his former visit and who had struck him as a good fellow. 

“Mrs. Tristram has spoken to me a great deal of you,” said Madame de Cintré gently, as she resumed her former place. 

Newman, after he had seated himself, began to consider what, in truth, was his errand. He had an unusual, unexpected sense of having wandered into a strange corner of the world. He was not given, as a general thing, to anticipating danger, or forecasting disaster, and he had had no social tremors on this particular occasion. He was not timid and he was not impudent. He felt too kindly toward himself to be the one, and too good-naturedly toward the rest of the world to be the other. But his native shrewdness sometimes placed his ease of temper at its mercy; with every disposition to take things simply, it was obliged to perceive that some things were not so simple as others. He felt as one does in missing a step, in an ascent, where one expected to find it. This strange, pretty woman, sitting in fire-side talk with her brother, in the gray depths of her inhospitable-looking house--what had he to say to her? She seemed enveloped in a sort of fantastic privacy; on what grounds had he pulled away the curtain? For a moment he felt as if he had plunged into some medium as deep as the ocean, and as if he must exert himself to keep from sinking. 

Meanwhile he was looking at Madame de Cintré, and she was settling herself in her chair and drawing in her long dress and turning her face towards him.Their eyes met; a moment afterwards she looked away and motioned to her brother to put a log on the fire. But the moment, and the glance which traversed it, had been sufficient to relieve Newman of the first and the last fit of personal embarrassment he was ever to know. He performed the movement which was so frequent with him, and which was always a sort of symbol of his taking mental possession of a scene--he extended his legs. The impression Madame de Cintré had made upon him on their first meeting came back in an instant; it had been deeper than he knew. She was pleasing, she was interesting; he had opened a book and the first lines held his attention. 

She asked him several questions: how lately he had seen Mrs. Tristram, how long he had been in Paris, how long he expected to remain there, how he liked it. She spoke English without an accent, or rather with that distinctively British accent which, on his arrival in Europe, had struck Newman as an altogether foreign tongue, but which, in women, he had come to like extremely. Here and there Madame de Cintré’s utterance had a faint shade of strangeness but at the end of ten minutes Newman found himself waiting for these soft roughnesses. He enjoyed them, and he marveled to see that gross thing, error, brought down to so fine a point. 

“You have a beautiful country,” said Madame de Cintré, presently. 

“Oh, magnificent!” said Newman. “You ought to see it.” 

“I shall never see it,” said Madame de Cintré with a smile. 

“Why not?” asked Newman. 

“I don’t travel; especially so far.” 

“But you go away sometimes; you are not always here?” 

“I go away in summer, a little way, to the country.” 

Newman wanted to ask her something more, something personal, he hardly knew what. “Don’t you find it rather--rather quiet here?” he said; “so far from the street?” Rather “gloomy,” he was going to say, but he reflected that that would be impolite. 

“Yes, it is very quiet,” said Madame de Cintré; “but we like that.” 

“Ah, you like that,” repeated Newman, slowly. 

“Besides, I have lived here all my life.” 

“Lived here all your life,” said Newman, in the same way. 

“I was born here, and my father was born here before me, and my grandfather, and my great-grandfathers. Were they not, Valentin?” and she appealed to her brother. 

“Yes, it’s a family habit to be born here!” the young man said with a laugh, and rose and threw the remnant of his cigarette into the fire, and then remained leaning against the chimney-piece. An observer would have perceived that he wished to take a better look at Newman, whom he covertly examined, while he stood stroking his moustache. 

“Your house is tremendously old, then,” said Newman. 

“How old is it, brother?” asked Madame de Cintré. 

The young man took the two candles from the mantel-shelf, lifted one high in each hand, and looked up toward the cornice of the room, above the chimney-piece. This latter feature of the apartment was of white marble, and in the familiar rococo style of the last century; but above it was a paneling of an earlier date, quaintly carved, painted white, and gilded here and there. The white had turned to yellow, and the gilding was tarnished. On the top, the figures ranged themselves into a sort of shield, on which an armorial device was cut. Above it, in relief, was a date--1627. “There you have it,” said the young man. “That is old or new, according to your point of view.” 

“Well, over here,” said Newman, “one’s point of view gets shifted round considerably.” And he threw back his head and looked about the room. “Your house is of a very curious style of architecture,” he said. 

“Are you interested in architecture?” asked the young man at the chimney-piece. 

“Well, I took the trouble, this summer,” said Newman, “to examine--as well as I can calculate--some four hundred and seventy churches. Do you call that interested?” 

“Perhaps you are interested in theology,” said the young man. 

“Not particularly. Are you a Roman Catholic, madam?” And he turned to Madame de Cintré. 

“Yes, sir,” she answered, gravely. 

Newman was struck with the gravity of her tone; he threw back his head and began to look round the room again. “Had you never noticed that number up there?” he presently asked. 

She hesitated a moment, and then, “In former years,” she said. 

Her brother had been watching Newman’s movement. “Perhaps you would like to examine the house,” he said. 

Newman slowly brought down his eyes and looked at him; he had a vague impression that the young man at the chimney-piece was inclined to irony. He was a handsome fellow, his face wore a smile, his moustaches were curled up at the ends, and there was a little dancing gleam in his eye. “Damn his French impudence!” Newman was on the point of saying to himself. “What the deuce is he grinning at?” He glanced at Madame de Cintré; she was sitting with her eyes fixed on the floor. She raised them, they met his, and she looked at her brother. Newman turned again to this young man and observed that he strikingly resembled his sister. This was in his favor, and our hero’s first impression of the Count Valentin, moreover, had been agreeable. His mistrust expired, and he said he would be very glad to see the house. 

The young man gave a frank laugh, and laid his hand on one of the candlesticks. “Good, good!” he exclaimed. “Come, then.” 

But Madame de Cintré rose quickly and grasped his arm, “Ah, Valentin!” she said. “What do you mean to do?” 

“To show Mr. Newman the house. It will be very amusing.” 

She kept her hand on his arm, and turned to Newman with a smile. “Don’t let him take you,” she said; “you will not find it amusing. It is a musty old house, like any other.” 

“It is full of curious things,” said the count, resisting. “Besides, I want to do it; it is a rare chance.” 

“You are very wicked, brother,” Madame de Cintré answered. 

“Nothing venture, nothing have!” cried the young man. “Will you come?” 

Madame de Cintré stepped toward Newman, gently clasping her hands and smiling softly. “Would you not prefer my society, here, by my fire, to stumbling about dark passages after my brother?” 

“A hundred times!” said Newman. “We will see the house some other day.” 

The young man put down his candlestick with mock solemnity, and, shaking his head, “Ah, you have defeated a great scheme, sir!” he said. 

“A scheme? I don’t understand,” said Newman. 

“You would have played your part in it all the better. Perhaps some day I shall have a chance to explain it.” 

“Be quiet, and ring for the tea,” said Madame de Cintré. 

The young man obeyed, and presently a servant brought in the tea, placed the tray on a small table, and departed. Madame de Cintré, from her place, busied herself with making it. She had but just begun when the door was thrown open and a lady rushed in, making a loud rustling sound. She stared at Newman, gave a little nod and a “Monsieur!” and then quickly approached Madame de Cintré and presented her forehead to be kissed. Madame de Cintré saluted her, and continued to make tea. The new-comer was young and pretty, it seemed to Newman; she wore her bonnet and cloak, and a train of royal proportions. She began to talk rapidly in French. “Oh, give me some tea, my beautiful one, for the love of God! I’m exhausted, mangled, massacred.” Newman found himself quite unable to follow her; she spoke much less distinctly than M. Nioche. 

“That is my sister-in-law,” said the Count Valentin, leaning towards him. 

“She is very pretty,” said Newman. 

“Exquisite,” answered the young man, and this time, again, Newman suspected him of irony. 

His sister-in-law came round to the other side of the fire with her cup of tea in her hand, holding it out at arm’s-length, so that she might not spill it on her dress, and uttering little cries of alarm. She placed the cup on the mantel-shelf and begun to unpin her veil and pull off her gloves, looking meanwhile at Newman. 

“Is there anything I can do for you, my dear lady?” the Count Valentin asked, in a sort of mock-caressing tone. 

“Present monsieur,” said his sister-in-law. 

The young man answered, “Mr. Newman!” 

“I can’t courtesy to you, monsieur, or I shall spill my tea,” said the lady. “So Claire receives strangers, like that?” she added, in a low voice, in French, to her brother-in-law. 

“Apparently!” he answered with a smile. Newman stood a moment, and then he approached Madame de Cintré. She looked up at him as if she were thinking of something to say. But she seemed to think of nothing; so she simply smiled. He sat down near her and she handed him a cup of tea. For a few moments they talked about that, and meanwhile he looked at her. He remembered what Mrs. Tristram had told him of her “perfection” and of her having, in combination, all the brilliant things that he dreamed of finding. This made him observe her not only without mistrust, but without uneasy conjectures; the presumption, from the first moment he looked at her, had been in her favor. And yet, if she was beautiful, it was not a dazzling beauty. She was tall and moulded in long lines; she had thick fair hair, a wide forehead, and features with a sort of harmonious irregularity. Her clear gray eyes were strikingly expressive; they were both gentle and intelligent, and Newman liked them immensely; but they had not those depths of splendor--those many-colored rays--which illumine the brows of famous beauties. Madame de Cintré was rather thin, and she looked younger than probably she was. 

In her whole person there was something both youthful and subdued, slender and yet ample, tranquil yet shy; a mixture of immaturity and repose, of innocence and dignity.What had Tristram meant, Newman wondered, by calling her proud? She was certainly not proud now, to him; or if she was, it was of no use, it was lost upon him; she must pile it up higher if she expected him to mind it. She was a beautiful woman, and it was very easy to get on with her. Was she a countess, a _marquise_, a kind of historical formation? Newman, who had rarely heard these words used, had never been at pains to attach any particular image to them; but they occurred to him now and seemed charged with a sort of melodious meaning. They signified something fair and softly bright, that had easy motions and spoke very agreeably. 

“Have you many friends in Paris; do you go out?” asked Madame de Cintré, who had at last thought of something to say. 

“Do you mean do I dance, and all that?” 

“Do you go _dans le monde_ , as we say?” 

“I have seen a good many people. Mrs. Tristram has taken me about. I do whatever she tells me.” 

“By yourself, you are not fond of amusements?” 

“Oh yes, of some sorts. I am not fond of dancing, and that sort of thing; I am too old and sober. But I want to be amused; I came to Europe for that.” 

“But you can be amused in America, too.” 

“I couldn’t; I was always at work. But after all, that was my amusement.” 

At this moment Madame de Bellegarde came back for another cup of tea, accompanied by the Count Valentin. Madame de Cintré, when she had served her, began to talk again with Newman, and recalling what he had last said, “In your own country you were very much occupied?” she asked. 

“I was in business. I have been in business since I was fifteen years old.” 

“And what was your business?” asked Madame de Bellegarde, who was decidedly not so pretty as Madame de Cintré. 

“I have been in everything,” said Newman. “At one time I sold leather; at one time I manufactured wash-tubs.” 

Madame de Bellegarde made a little grimace. “Leather? I don’t like that. Wash-tubs are better. I prefer the smell of soap. I hope at least they made your fortune.” She rattled this off with the air of a woman who had the reputation of saying everything that came into her head, and with a strong French accent. 

Newman had spoken with cheerful seriousness, but Madame de Bellegarde’s tone made him go on, after a meditative pause, with a certain light grimness of jocularity. “No, I lost money on wash-tubs, but I came out pretty square on leather.” 

“I have made up my mind, after all,” said Madame de Bellegarde, “that the great point is--how do you call it?--to come out square. I am on my knees to money; I don’t deny it. If you have it, I ask no questions. For that I am a real democrat--like you, monsieur. Madame de Cintré is very proud; but I find that one gets much more pleasure in this sad life if one doesn’t look too close.” 

“Just Heaven, dear madam, how you go at it,” said the Count Valentin, lowering his voice. 

“He’s a man one can speak to, I suppose, since my sister receives him,” the lady answered. “Besides, it’s very true; those are my ideas.” 

“Ah, you call them ideas,” murmured the young man. 

“But Mrs. Tristram told me you had been in the army--in your war,” said Madame de Cintré. 

“Yes, but that is not business!” said Newman. 

“Very true!” said M. de Bellegarde. “Otherwise perhaps I should not be penniless.” 

“Is it true,” asked Newman in a moment, “that you are so proud? I had already heard it.” 

Madame de Cintré smiled. “Do you find me so?” 

“Oh,” said Newman, “I am no judge. If you are proud with me, you will have to tell me. Otherwise I shall not know it.” 

Madame de Cintré began to laugh. “That would be pride in a sad position!” she said. 

“It would be partly,” Newman went on, “because I shouldn’t want to know it. I want you to treat me well.” 

Madame de Cintré, whose laugh had ceased, looked at him with her head half averted, as if she feared what he was going to say. 

“Mrs. Tristram told you the literal truth,” he went on; “I want very much to know you. I didn’t come here simply to call to-day; I came in the hope that you might ask me to come again.” 

“Oh, pray come often,” said Madame de Cintré. 

“But will you be at home?” Newman insisted. Even to himself he seemed a trifle “pushing,” but he was, in truth, a trifle excited. 

“I hope so!” said Madame de Cintré. 

Newman got up. “Well, we shall see,” he said smoothing his hat with his coat-cuff. 

“Brother,” said Madame de Cintré, “invite Mr. Newman to come again.” 

The Count Valentin looked at our hero from head to foot with his peculiar smile, in which impudence and urbanity seemed perplexingly commingled. “Are you a brave man?” he asked, eying him askance. 

“Well, I hope so,” said Newman. 

“I rather suspect so. In that case, come again.” 

“Ah, what an invitation!” murmured Madame de Cintré, with something painful in her smile. 

“Oh, I want Mr. Newman to come--particularly,” said the young man. “It will give me great pleasure. I shall be desolate if I miss one of his visits. But I maintain he must be brave. A stout heart, sir!” And he offered Newman his hand. 

“I shall not come to see you; I shall come to see Madame de Cintré,” said Newman. 

“You will need all the more courage.” 

“Ah, Valentin!” said Madame de Cintré, appealingly. 

“Decidedly,” cried Madame de Bellegarde, “I am the only person here capable of saying something polite! Come to see me; you will need no courage,” she said. 

Newman gave a laugh which was not altogether an assent, and took his leave. Madame de Cintré did not take up her sister’s challenge to be gracious, but she looked with a certain troubled air at the retreating guest.
