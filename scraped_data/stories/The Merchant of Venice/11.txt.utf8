<ACTION>Enter Nerissa and a Servitor.</ACTION> 

NERISSA Quick, quick, I pray thee, draw the curtain straight. The Prince of Arragon hath ta’en his oath And comes to his election presently. 

<ACTION>Enter the Prince of Arragon, his train, and Portia.</ACTION> 

PORTIA Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince. If you choose that wherein I am contained,	 Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized. But if you fail, without more speech, my lord, You must be gone from hence immediately. 

ARRAGON I am enjoined by oath to observe three things: First, never to unfold to anyone	 Which casket ’twas I chose; next, if I fail Of the right casket, never in my life To woo a maid in way of marriage; Lastly, if I do fail in fortune of my choice, Immediately to leave you, and be gone.	 

PORTIA To these injunctions everyone doth swear That comes to hazard for my worthless self. 

ARRAGON And so have I addressed me. Fortune now To my heart’s hope! Gold, silver, and base lead. “Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he	 hath.” You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard. What says the golden chest? Ha, let me see: “Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.”	 What many men desire—that “many” may be meant By the fool multitude that choose by show, Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach, Which pries not to th’ interior, but like the martlet	 Builds in the weather on the outward wall, Even in the force and road of casualty. I will not choose what many men desire, Because I will not jump with common spirits And rank me with the barbarous multitudes. Why, then, to thee, thou silver treasure house. Tell me once more what title thou dost bear. “Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.” And well said, too; for who shall go about	 To cozen fortune and be honorable Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume To wear an undeservèd dignity. O, that estates, degrees, and offices Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honor	 Were purchased by the merit of the wearer! 

How many then should cover that stand bare?How many be commanded that command? How much low peasantry would then be gleaned From the true seed of honor? And how much honor	 Picked from the chaff and ruin of the times, To be new varnished? Well, but to my choice. “Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.” I will assume desert. Give me a key for this, 

<ACTION>He is given a key.</ACTION> 

And instantly unlock my fortunes here. 

<ACTION>He opens the silver casket.</ACTION> 

PORTIA Too long a pause for that which you find there. 

ARRAGON What’s here? The portrait of a blinking idiot Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.— How much unlike art thou to Portia!	 How much unlike my hopes and my deservings. “Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves”? Did I deserve no more than a fool’s head? Is that my prize? Are my deserts no better?	 

PORTIA To offend and judge are distinct offices And of opposèd natures. 

ARRAGON  What is here? 

<ACTION>He reads.</ACTION> 

:The fire seven times tried this; Seven times tried that judgment is	 That did never choose amiss. Some there be that shadows kiss; Such have but a shadow’s bliss. There be fools alive, iwis, Silvered o’er—and so was this.	 Take what wife you will to bed, I will ever be your head. So begone; you are sped. Still more fool I shall appear By the time I linger here.	 With one fool’s head I came to woo, But I go away with two. Sweet, adieu. I’ll keep my oath, Patiently to bear my wroth.	 

<ACTION>He exits with his train.</ACTION> 

PORTIA Thus hath the candle singed the moth.	 O, these deliberate fools, when they do choose, They have the wisdom by their wit to lose. 

NERISSA The ancient saying is no heresy: Hanging and wiving goes by destiny. 

PORTIA  Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.	 

<ACTION>Enter Messenger.</ACTION> 

MESSENGER Where is my lady? 

PORTIA Here. What would my lord? 

MESSENGER Madam, there is alighted at your gate A young Venetian, one that comes before	 To signify th’ approaching of his lord, From whom he bringeth sensible regreets; To wit (besides commends and courteous breath), Gifts of rich value; yet I have not seen So likely an ambassador of love.	 A day in April never came so sweet, To show how costly summer was at hand, As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord. 

PORTIA No more, I pray thee. I am half afeard Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,	 Thou spend’st such high-day wit in praising him! Come, come, Nerissa, for I long to see Quick Cupid’s post that comes so mannerly. 

NERISSA Bassanio, Lord Love, if thy will it be! 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
