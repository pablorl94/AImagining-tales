<ACTION>Enter, in arms, Louis the Dauphin, Salisbury, Melun,Pembroke, Bigot, and French and English Soldiers.</ACTION> 

DAUPHIN ,  <ACTION>handing a paper to Melun</ACTION> My Lord Melun, let this be copied out, And keep it safe for our remembrance. Return the precedent to these lords again, That having our fair order written down, Both they and we, perusing o’er these notes,	 May know wherefore we took the Sacrament, And keep our faiths firm and inviolable. 

SALISBURY Upon our sides it never shall be broken. And, noble dauphin, albeit we swear A voluntary zeal and unurged faith	 To your proceedings, yet believe me, prince, I am not glad that such a sore of time Should seek a plaster by contemned revolt And heal the inveterate canker of one wound By making many. O, it grieves my soul	 That I must draw this metal from my side To be a widow-maker! O, and there Where honorable rescue and defense Cries out upon the name of Salisbury! But such is the infection of the time	 That for the health and physic of our right, We cannot deal but with the very hand Of stern injustice and confusèd wrong. And is ’t not pity, O my grievèd friends, That we, the sons and children of this isle,	 Was born to see so sad an hour as this, Wherein we step after a stranger, march Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up Her enemies’ ranks? I must withdraw and weep Upon the spot of this enforcèd cause,	 To grace the gentry of a land remote, And follow unacquainted colors here. What, here? 

O nation, that thou couldst remove, That Neptune’s arms, who clippeth thee about, Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself	 And grapple thee unto a pagan shore, Where these two Christian armies might combine The blood of malice in a vein of league, And not to spend it so unneighborly.

<ACTION>He weeps.</ACTION> 

DAUPHIN A noble temper dost thou show in this,	 And great affections wrestling in thy bosom Doth make an earthquake of nobility. O, what a noble combat hast thou fought Between compulsion and a brave respect! Let me wipe off this honorable dew	 That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks. My heart hath melted at a lady’s tears, Being an ordinary inundation, But this effusion of such manly drops, This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,	 Startles mine eyes and makes me more amazed Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven Figured quite o’er with burning meteors. Lift up thy brow, renownèd Salisbury, And with a great heart heave away this storm.	 Commend these waters to those baby eyes That never saw the giant world enraged, Nor met with fortune other than at feasts Full warm of blood, of mirth, of gossiping. Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep	 Into the purse of rich prosperity As Louis himself.—So, nobles, shall you all, That knit your sinews to the strength of mine. And even there, methinks, an angel spake. 

<ACTION>Enter Pandulph.</ACTION> 

Look where the holy legate comes apace	 To give us warrant from the hand of God, And on our actions set the name of right With holy breath. 

PANDULPH Hail, noble prince of France. The next is this: King John hath reconciled	 Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in That so stood out against the holy Church, The great metropolis and See of Rome. Therefore thy threat’ning colors now wind up, And tame the savage spirit of wild war	 That, like a lion fostered up at hand, It may lie gently at the foot of peace And be no further harmful than in show. 

DAUPHIN Your Grace shall pardon me; I will not back. I am too high-born to be propertied,	 To be a secondary at control, Or useful servingman and instrument To any sovereign state throughout the world. Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars Between this chastised kingdom and myself	 And brought in matter that should feed this fire; And now ’tis far too huge to be blown out With that same weak wind which enkindled it. You taught me how to know the face of right, Acquainted me with interest to this land,	 Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart. And come you now to tell me John hath made His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me? I, by the honor of my marriage bed, After young Arthur claim this land for mine. And now it is half conquered, must I back Because that John hath made his peace with Rome? Am I Rome’s slave? What penny hath Rome borne? What men provided? What munition sent To underprop this action? Is ’t not I	 That undergo this charge? Who else but I, And such as to my claim are liable, Sweat in this business and maintain this war? 

Have I not heard these islanders shout out “Vive le Roi” as I have banked their towns?Have I not here the best cards for the game To win this easy match played for a crown? And shall I now give o’er the yielded set? No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said. 

PANDULPH You look but on the outside of this work.	 

DAUPHIN Outside or inside, I will not return Till my attempt so much be glorified As to my ample hope was promisèd Before I drew this gallant head of war And culled these fiery spirits from the world	 To outlook conquest and to win renown Even in the jaws of danger and of death. 

<ACTION>A trumpet sounds.</ACTION> 

What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us? 

<ACTION>Enter Bastard.</ACTION> 

BASTARD According to the fair play of the world, Let me have audience. I am sent to speak,	 My holy lord of Milan, from the King. I come to learn how you have dealt for him, And, as you answer, I do know the scope And warrant limited unto my tongue. 

PANDULPH The Dauphin is too willful-opposite	 And will not temporize with my entreaties. He flatly says he’ll not lay down his arms. 

BASTARD By all the blood that ever fury breathed, The youth says well! Now hear our English king, For thus his royalty doth speak in me:	 He is prepared—and reason too he should. This apish and unmannerly approach, This harnessed masque and unadvisèd revel, This unheard sauciness and boyish troops, The King doth smile at, and is well prepared	 To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms, From out the circle of his territories. That hand which had the strength, even at your door, To cudgel you and make you take the hatch, To dive like buckets in concealèd wells,	 To crouch in litter of your stable planks, To lie like pawns locked up in chests and trunks, To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake Even at the crying of your nation’s crow,	 Thinking this voice an armèd Englishman— Shall that victorious hand be feebled here That in your chambers gave you chastisement? No! Know the gallant monarch is in arms, And like an eagle o’er his aerie towers	 To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.— And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts, You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb Of your dear mother England, blush for shame! 

For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids	 Like Amazons come tripping after drums, Their thimbles into armèd gauntlets change, Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts To fierce and bloody inclination.

DAUPHIN There end thy brave and turn thy face in peace.	 We grant thou canst outscold us. Fare thee well. We hold our time too precious to be spent With such a brabbler. 

PANDULPH Give me leave to speak. 

BASTARD No, I will speak.	 

DAUPHIN We will attend to neither. Strike up the drums, and let the tongue of war Plead for our interest and our being here. 

BASTARD Indeed, your drums being beaten will cry out, And so shall you, being beaten. Do but start	 An echo with the clamor of thy drum, And even at hand a drum is ready braced That shall reverberate all as loud as thine. Sound but another, and another shall, As loud as thine, rattle the welkin’s ear	 And mock the deep-mouthed thunder. For at hand, Not trusting to this halting legate here, Whom he hath used rather for sport than need, Is warlike John, and in his forehead sits A bare-ribbed Death, whose office is this day	 To feast upon whole thousands of the French. 

DAUPHIN Strike up our drums to find this danger out. 

BASTARD And thou shalt find it, dauphin, do not doubt. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
