<ACTION>Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Gonzalo, Adrian,Francisco, and others.</ACTION> 

GONZALO ,  <ACTION>to Alonso</ACTION> Beseech you, sir, be merry. You have cause— So have we all—of joy, for our escape Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe Is common; every day some sailor’s wife, The masters of some merchant, and the merchant	 Have just our theme of woe. But for the miracle— I mean our preservation—few in millions Can speak like us. Then wisely, good sir, weigh Our sorrow with our comfort. 

ALONSO Prithee, peace.	 

SEBASTIAN ,  <ACTION>aside to Antonio</ACTION> He receives comfort like cold porridge. 

ANTONIO The visitor will not give him o’er so. 

SEBASTIAN Look, he’s winding up the watch of his wit. By and by it will strike.	 

GONZALO ,  <ACTION>to Alonso </ACTION> Sir— 

SEBASTIAN One. Tell. 

GONZALO When every grief is entertained that’s offered, comes to th’ entertainer— 

SEBASTIAN A dollar.	 

GONZALO  Dolor comes to him indeed. You have spoken truer than you purposed. 

SEBASTIAN  You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should. 

GONZALO ,  <ACTION>to Alonso</ACTION> Therefore, my lord—	 

ANTONIO  Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue. 

ALONSO ,  <ACTION>to Gonzalo</ACTION> I prithee, spare. 

GONZALO Well, I have done. But yet— 

SEBASTIAN ,  <ACTION>aside to Antonio </ACTION> He will be talking. 

ANTONIO ,  <ACTION>aside to Sebastian</ACTION> Which, of he or Adrian,	 for a good wager, first begins to crow? 

SEBASTIAN The old cock. 

ANTONIO The cockerel. 

SEBASTIAN Done. The wager? 

ANTONIO A laughter.	 

SEBASTIAN  A match! 

ADRIAN Though this island seem to be desert— 

ANTONIO Ha, ha, ha. 

SEBASTIAN So. You’re paid. 

ADRIAN Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible—	 

SEBASTIAN Yet— 

ADRIAN Yet— 

ANTONIO He could not miss ’t. 

ADRIAN It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate temperance.	 

ANTONIO Temperance was a delicate wench. 

SEBASTIAN Ay, and a subtle, as he most learnedly delivered. 

ADRIAN The air breathes upon us here most sweetly. 

SEBASTIAN As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.	 

ANTONIO Or as ’twere perfumed by a fen. 

GONZALO Here is everything advantageous to life. 

ANTONIO  True, save means to live. 

SEBASTIAN Of that there’s none, or little. 

GONZALO How lush and lusty the grass looks! How	 green! 

ANTONIO The ground indeed is tawny. 

SEBASTIAN With an eye of green in ’t. 

ANTONIO He misses not much. 

SEBASTIAN No, he doth but mistake the truth totally.	 

GONZALO But the rarity of it is, which is indeed almost beyond credit— 

SEBASTIAN As many vouched rarities are. 

GONZALO That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in the sea, hold notwithstanding their	 freshness and gloss, being rather new-dyed than stained with salt water. 

ANTONIO If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not say he lies? 

SEBASTIAN Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.	 

GONZALO Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the King’s fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis. 

SEBASTIAN ’Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper	 well in our return. 

ADRIAN  Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen. 

GONZALO Not since widow Dido’s time. 

ANTONIO Widow? A pox o’ that! How came that “widow”	 in? Widow Dido! 

SEBASTIAN What if he had said “widower Aeneas” too? Good Lord, how you take it! 

ADRIAN ,  <ACTION>to Gonzalo</ACTION> “Widow Dido,” said you? You make me study of that. She was of Carthage, not of	 Tunis. 

GONZALO This Tunis, sir, was Carthage. 

ADRIAN Carthage? 

GONZALO I assure you, Carthage. 

ANTONIO  His word is more than the miraculous harp.	 

SEBASTIAN He hath raised the wall, and houses too. 

ANTONIO What impossible matter will he make easy next? 

SEBASTIAN I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple.	 

ANTONIO And sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands. 

GONZALO Ay. 

ANTONIO Why, in good time. 

GONZALO ,  <ACTION>to Alonso</ACTION> Sir, we were talking that our	 garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now queen. 

ANTONIO And the rarest that e’er came there. 

SEBASTIAN Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.	 

ANTONIO O, widow Dido? Ay, widow Dido. 

GONZALO ,  <ACTION>to Alonso </ACTION> Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it? I mean, in a sort. 

ANTONIO That “sort” was well fished for. 

GONZALO ,  <ACTION>to Alonso</ACTION> When I wore it at your daughter’s	 marriage. 

ALONSO You cram these words into mine ears against The stomach of my sense. Would I had never Married my daughter there, for coming thence My son is lost, and, in my rate, she too,	 Who is so far from Italy removed I ne’er again shall see her.—O, thou mine heir Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish Hath made his meal on thee? 

FRANCISCO Sir, he may live.	 I saw him beat the surges under him And ride upon their backs. He trod the water, Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted The surge most swoll’n that met him. His bold head ’Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared	 Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke To th’ shore, that o’er his wave-worn basis bowed, As stooping to relieve him. I not doubt He came alive to land. 

ALONSO  No, no, he’s gone.	 

SEBASTIAN Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss, That would not bless our Europe with your daughter, But rather lose her to an African, Where she at least is banished from your eye, Who hath cause to wet the grief on ’t.	 

ALONSO  Prithee, peace. 

SEBASTIAN You were kneeled to and importuned otherwise By all of us; and the fair soul herself Weighed between loathness and obedience at Which end o’ th’ beam should bow. We have lost	 your son, I fear, forever. Milan and Naples have More widows in them of this business’ making Than we bring men to comfort them. The fault’s your own.	 

ALONSO So is the dear’st o’ th’ loss. 

GONZALO My lord Sebastian, The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in. You rub the sore When you should bring the plaster.	 

SEBASTIAN Very well. 

ANTONIO And most chirurgeonly. 

GONZALO ,  <ACTION>to Alonso</ACTION> It is foul weather in us all, good sir, When you are cloudy. 

SEBASTIAN Foul weather?	 

ANTONIO Very foul. 

GONZALO Had I plantation of this isle, my lord— 

ANTONIO He’d sow ’t with nettle seed. 

SEBASTIAN Or docks, or mallows. 

GONZALO And were the king on ’t, what would I do?	 

SEBASTIAN Scape being drunk, for want of wine. 

GONZALO I’ th’ commonwealth I would by contraries Execute all things, for no kind of traffic Would I admit; no name of magistrate; Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,	 And use of service, none; contract, succession, Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none; No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil; No occupation; all men idle, all, And women too, but innocent and pure;	 No sovereignty— 

SEBASTIAN Yet he would be king on ’t. 

ANTONIO The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning. 

GONZALO All things in common nature should produce	 Without sweat or endeavor; treason, felony, Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine Would I not have; but nature should bring forth Of its own kind all foison, all abundance, To feed my innocent people.	 

SEBASTIAN No marrying ’mong his subjects? 

ANTONIO None, man, all idle: whores and knaves. 

GONZALO I would with such perfection govern, sir, T’ excel the Golden Age. 

SEBASTIAN ’Save his Majesty!	 

ANTONIO Long live Gonzalo! 

GONZALO  And do you mark me, sir? 

ALONSO Prithee, no more. Thou dost talk nothing to me. 

GONZALO I do well believe your Highness, and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen, who are of	 such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing. 

ANTONIO ’Twas you we laughed at. 

GONZALO Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you. So you may continue, and laugh at	 nothing still. 

ANTONIO What a blow was there given! 

SEBASTIAN An it had not fallen flatlong. 

GONZALO  You are gentlemen of brave mettle. You would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would	 continue in it five weeks without changing. 

<ACTION>Enter Ariel invisible, playing solemn music.</ACTION> 

SEBASTIAN We would so, and then go a-batfowling. 

ANTONIO ,  <ACTION>to Gonzalo</ACTION> Nay, good my lord, be not angry. 

GONZALO No, I warrant you, I will not adventure my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh me asleep?	 For I am very heavy. 

ANTONIO  Go sleep, and hear us. 

<ACTION>All sink down asleep except Alonso,Antonio, and Sebastian.</ACTION> 

ALONSO What, all so soon asleep? I wish mine eyes Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts. I find They are inclined to do so.	 

SEBASTIAN Please you, sir, Do not omit the heavy offer of it. It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth, It is a comforter. 

ANTONIO We two, my lord,	 Will guard your person while you take your rest, And watch your safety. 

ALONSO Thank you. Wondrous heavy. 

<ACTION>Alonso sleeps. Ariel exits.</ACTION> 

SEBASTIAN What a strange drowsiness possesses them! 

ANTONIO It is the quality o’ th’ climate.	 

SEBASTIAN Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find Not myself disposed to sleep. 

ANTONIO Nor I. My spirits are nimble. They fell together all, as by consent.	 They dropped as by a thunderstroke. What might, Worthy Sebastian, O, what might—? No more. And yet methinks I see it in thy face What thou shouldst be. Th’ occasion speaks thee, and My strong imagination sees a crown	 Dropping upon thy head. 

SEBASTIAN What, art thou waking? 

ANTONIO Do you not hear me speak? 

SEBASTIAN I do, and surely It is a sleepy language, and thou speak’st	 Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say? This is a strange repose, to be asleep With eyes wide open—standing, speaking, moving— And yet so fast asleep. 

ANTONIO  Noble Sebastian,	 Thou let’st thy fortune sleep, die rather, wink’st Whiles thou art waking. 

SEBASTIAN Thou dost snore distinctly. There’s meaning in thy snores. 

ANTONIO I am more serious than my custom. You	 Must be so too, if heed me; which to do Trebles thee o’er. 

SEBASTIAN Well, I am standing water. 

ANTONIO I’ll teach you how to flow. 

SEBASTIAN Do so. To ebb	 Hereditary sloth instructs me. 

ANTONIO  O, If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it, how in stripping it You more invest it. Ebbing men indeed	 Most often do so near the bottom run By their own fear or sloth. 

SEBASTIAN Prithee, say on. The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim A matter from thee, and a birth indeed	 Which throes thee much to yield. 

ANTONIO Thus, sir: Although this lord of weak remembrance—this, Who shall be of as little memory When he is earthed—hath here almost persuaded—	 For he’s a spirit of persuasion, only Professes to persuade—the King his son’s alive, ’Tis as impossible that he’s undrowned As he that sleeps here swims. 

SEBASTIAN I have no hope	 That he’s undrowned. 

ANTONIO O, out of that no hope What great hope have you! No hope that way is Another way so high a hope that even Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,	 But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me That Ferdinand is drowned? 

SEBASTIAN  He’s gone. 

ANTONIO Then tell me, Who’s the next heir of Naples?	 

SEBASTIAN Claribel. 

ANTONIO She that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells Ten leagues beyond man’s life; she that from Naples Can have no note, unless the sun were post— The man i’ th’ moon’s too slow—till newborn chins	 Be rough and razorable; she that from whom We all were sea-swallowed, though some cast again, And by that destiny to perform an act Whereof what’s past is prologue, what to come In yours and my discharge.	 

SEBASTIAN What stuff is this? How say you? ’Tis true my brother’s daughter’s Queen of Tunis, So is she heir of Naples, ’twixt which regions There is some space. 

ANTONIO A space whose ev’ry cubit	 Seems to cry out “How shall that Claribel Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis And let Sebastian wake.” Say this were death That now hath seized them, why, they were no worse Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples	 As well as he that sleeps, lords that can prate As amply and unnecessarily As this Gonzalo. I myself could make A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore The mind that I do, what a sleep were this	 For your advancement! Do you understand me? 

SEBASTIAN Methinks I do. 

ANTONIO And how does your content Tender your own good fortune? 

SEBASTIAN I remember	 You did supplant your brother Prospero. 

ANTONIO  True, And look how well my garments sit upon me, Much feater than before. My brother’s servants Were then my fellows; now they are my men.	 

SEBASTIAN But, for your conscience? 

ANTONIO Ay, sir, where lies that? If ’twere a kibe, ’Twould put me to my slipper, but I feel not This deity in my bosom. Twenty consciences That stand ’twixt me and Milan, candied be they	 And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother, No better than the earth he lies upon. If he were that which now he’s like—that’s dead— Whom I with this obedient steel, three inches of it, Can lay to bed forever; whiles you, doing thus,	 To the perpetual wink for aye might put This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest, They’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk. They’ll tell the clock to any business that	 We say befits the hour. 

SEBASTIAN Thy case, dear friend, Shall be my precedent: as thou got’st Milan, I’ll come by Naples. Draw thy sword. One stroke Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest,	 And I the King shall love thee. 

ANTONIO  Draw together, And when I rear my hand, do you the like To fall it on Gonzalo.	 <ACTION>They draw their swords.</ACTION> 

SEBASTIAN O, but one word.	 

<ACTION>They talk apart.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Ariel, invisible, with music and song.</ACTION> 

ARIEL ,  <ACTION>to the sleeping Gonzalo</ACTION> My master through his art foresees the danger That you, his friend, are in, and sends me forth— For else his project dies—to keep them living. <ACTION>Sings in Gonzalo’s ear:</ACTION> While you here do snoring lie, Open-eyed conspiracy	 His time doth take. If of life you keep a care, Shake off slumber and beware. Awake, awake! 

ANTONIO ,  <ACTION>to Sebastian</ACTION> Then let us both be sudden.	 

GONZALO ,  <ACTION>waking</ACTION> Now, good angels preserve the King!	 <ACTION>He wakes Alonso.</ACTION> 

ALONSO ,  <ACTION>to Sebastian</ACTION> Why, how now, ho! Awake? Why are you drawn? Wherefore this ghastly looking? 

GONZALO , t <ACTION>o Sebastian </ACTION> What’s the matter?	 

SEBASTIAN Whiles we stood here securing your repose, Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing Like bulls, or rather lions. Did ’t not wake you? It struck mine ear most terribly. 

ALONSO I heard nothing.	 

ANTONIO O, ’twas a din to fright a monster’s ear, To make an earthquake. Sure, it was the roar Of a whole herd of lions. 

ALONSO Heard you this, Gonzalo? 

GONZALO Upon mine honor, sir, I heard a humming,	 And that a strange one too, which did awake me. I shaked you, sir, and cried. As mine eyes opened, I saw their weapons drawn. There was a noise, That’s verily. ’Tis best we stand upon our guard, Or that we quit this place. Let’s draw our weapons.	 

ALONSO Lead off this ground, and let’s make further search For my poor son. 

GONZALO Heavens keep him from these beasts, For he is, sure, i’ th’ island. 

ALONSO  Lead away.	 

ARIEL ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Prospero my lord shall know what I have done. So, king, go safely on to seek thy son. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
