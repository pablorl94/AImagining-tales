You believe in a palace of crystal that can never be destroyed--a palace at which one will not be able to put out one's tongue or make a long nose on the sly.  And perhaps that is just why I am afraid of this edifice, that it is of crystal and can never be destroyed and that one cannot put one's tongue out at it even on the sly. 

You see, if it were not a palace, but a hen-house, I might creep into it to avoid getting wet, and yet I would not call the hen-house a palace out of gratitude to it for keeping me dry.  You laugh and say that in such circumstances a hen-house is as good as a mansion.  Yes, I answer, if one had to live simply to keep out of the rain. 

But what is to be done if I have taken it into my head that that is not the only object in life, and that if one must live one had better live in a mansion? That is my choice, my desire. You will only eradicate it when you have changed my preference. Well, do change it, allure me with something else, give me another ideal. But meanwhile I will not take a hen-house for a mansion. The palace of crystal may be an idle dream, it may be that it is inconsistent with the laws of nature and that I have invented it only through my own stupidity, through the old-fashioned irrational habits of my generation. But what does it matter to me that it is inconsistent? That makes no difference since it exists in my desires, or rather exists as long as my desires exist. Perhaps you are laughing again? Laugh away; I will put up with any mockery rather than pretend that I am satisfied when I am hungry. I know, anyway, that I will not be put off with a compromise, with a recurring zero, simply because it is consistent with the laws of nature and actually exists. 

I will not accept as the crown of my desires a block of buildings with tenements for the poor on a lease of a thousand years, and perhaps with a sign-board of a dentist hanging out.Destroy my desires, eradicate my ideals, show me something better, and I will follow you. You will say, perhaps, that it is not worth your trouble; but in that case I can give you the same answer. We are discussing things seriously; but if you won't deign to give me your attention, I will drop your acquaintance. I can retreat into my underground hole. 

But while I am alive and have desires I would rather my hand were withered off than bring one brick to such a building!  Don't remind me that I have just rejected the palace of crystal for the sole reason that one cannot put out one's tongue at it.  I did not say because I am so fond of putting my tongue out.  Perhaps the thing I resented was, that of all your edifices there has not been one at which one could not put out one's tongue.  On the contrary, I would let my tongue be cut off out of gratitude if things could be so arranged that I should lose all desire to put it out.  It is not my fault that things cannot be so arranged, and that one must be satisfied with model flats.  Then why am I made with such desires?  Can I have been constructed simply in order to come to the conclusion that all my construction is a cheat?  Can this be my whole purpose?  I do not believe it. 

But do you know what: I am convinced that we underground folk ought to be kept on a curb.  Though we may sit forty years underground without speaking, when we do come out into the light of day and break out we talk and talk and talk....
