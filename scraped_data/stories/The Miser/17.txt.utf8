SCENE II.--HARPAGON, CLÉANTE, ÉLISE, VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES, BRINDAVOINE, LA MERLUCHE. 

HAR. To you, Brindavoine, and to you, La Merluche, belongs the duty of washing the glasses, and of giving to drink, but only when people are thirsty, and not according to the custom of certain impertinent lackeys, who urge them to drink, and put the idea into their heads when they are not thinking about it. Wait until you have been asked several times, and remember always to have plenty of water. 

JAC. (_aside_). Yes; wine without water gets into one's head. 

LA MER. Shall we take off our smocks, Sir? 

HAR. Yes, when you see the guests coming; but be very careful not to spoil your clothes. 

BRIND. You know, Sir, that one of the fronts of my doublet is covered with a large stain of oil from the lamp. 

LA MER. And I, Sir, that my breeches are all torn behind, and that, saving your presence ... 

HAR. (_to_ LA MERLUCHE). Peace! Turn carefully towards the wall, and always face the company. (_To_ BRINDAVOINE, _showing him how he is to hold his hat before his doublet, to hide the stain of oil_) And you, always hold your hat in this fashion when you wait on the guests.
