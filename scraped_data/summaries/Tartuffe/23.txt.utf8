Elmire is confused by this last remark; she asks Orgon what Tartuffe meant.

Orgon, dolt that he is, has signed a "deed of gift," a document that transfers ownership of something to another party. In this case, that something, seems to be, well, everything. To top it all off, he fears that Tartuffe may have made off with something else very, very valuable that Orgon kept locked away.
