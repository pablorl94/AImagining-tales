Several months laterâ€¦ a painted lady walks down the street. Attempts to make eye contact with men fail. We assume this is Maggie, poor thing, now a prostitute looking for some man to pick her up.

Men stare and offer excuses; no one is interested. She continues walking down the wet, cold streets until she gets to the river. What will happen to poor Maggie?
