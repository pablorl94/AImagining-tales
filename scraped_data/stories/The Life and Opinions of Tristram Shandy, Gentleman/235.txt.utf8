Chapter 4.XVI. 

As I perceived the commissary of the post-office would have his six livres four sous, I had nothing else for it, but to say some smart thing upon the occasion, worth the money: 

And so I set off thus:-- 

--And pray, Mr. Commissary, by what law of courtesy is a defenceless stranger to be used just the reverse from what you use a Frenchman in this matter? 

By no means; said he. 

Excuse me; said I--for you have begun, Sir, with first tearing off my breeches-and now you want my pocket-- 

Whereas--had you first taken my pocket, as you do with your own people--and then left me bare a..'d after--I had been a beast to have complain'd-- 

As it is-- 

--'Tis contrary to the law of nature. 

--'Tis contrary to reason. 

--'Tis contrary to the Gospel. 

But not to this--said he--putting a printed paper into my hand, 

Par le Roy. 

--'Tis a pithy prolegomenon, quoth I--and so read on.... 

--By all which it appears, quoth I, having read it over, a little too rapidly, that if a man sets out in a post-chaise from Paris--he must go on travelling in one, all the days of his life--or pay for it.--Excuse me, said the commissary, the spirit of the ordinance is this--That if you set out with an intention of running post from Paris to Avignon, &c. you shall not change that intention or mode of travelling, without first satisfying the fermiers for two posts further than the place you repent at--and 'tis founded, continued he, upon this, that the Revenues are not to fall short through your fickleness-- 

--O by heavens! cried I--if fickleness is taxable in France--we have nothing to do but to make the best peace with you we can-- 

And So the Peace Was Made; 

--And if it is a bad one--as Tristram Shandy laid the corner-stone of it--nobody but Tristram Shandy ought to be hanged.
