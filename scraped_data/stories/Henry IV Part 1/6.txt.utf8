<ACTION>Enter Hotspur alone, reading a letter.</ACTION> 

HOTSPUR <ACTION>But, for mine own part, my lord, I could bewell contented to be there, in respect of the love Ibear your house.</ACTION> He could be contented; why is he not, then? In respect of the love he bears our house—he shows in this he loves his own barn	 better than he loves our house. Let me see some more. <ACTION>The purpose you undertake is dangerous.</ACTION> Why, that’s certain. ’Tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to drink; but I tell you, my Lord Fool, out of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. <ACTION>The purpose you undertake is dangerous, the friendsyou have named uncertain, the time itself unsorted,and your whole plot too light for the counterpoiseof so great an opposition.</ACTION> Say you so, say you so? I say unto you again, you are a shallow, cowardly	 hind, and you lie. What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord, our plot is a good plot as ever was laid, our friends true and constant—a good plot, good friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot, very good friends. What a frosty-spirited	 rogue is this! 

Why, my Lord of York commends the plot and the general course of the action.Zounds, an I were now by this rascal, I could brain him with his lady’s fan. Is there not my father, my uncle, and myself, Lord Edmund Mortimer, my	 Lord of York, and Owen Glendower? Is there not besides the Douglas? Have I not all their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month, and are they not some of them set forward already? What a pagan rascal is this—an infidel! Ha, you	 shall see now, in very sincerity of fear and cold heart, will he to the King and lay open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself and go to buffets for moving such a dish of skim milk with so honorable an action! Hang him, let him tell the	 King. We are prepared. I will set forward tonight. 

<ACTION>Enter his Lady.</ACTION> 

How now, Kate? I must leave you within these two hours. 

LADY PERCY O my good lord, why are you thus alone? For what offense have I this fortnight been	 A banished woman from my Harry’s bed? Tell me, sweet lord, what is ’t that takes from thee Thy stomach, pleasure, and thy golden sleep? Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth And start so often when thou sit’st alone? Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks And given my treasures and my rights of thee To thick-eyed musing and curst melancholy? In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watched, And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars,	 Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed, Cry “Courage! To the field!” And thou hast talked Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents, Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets, Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,	 Of prisoners’ ransom, and of soldiers slain, And all the currents of a heady fight. Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war, And thus hath so bestirred thee in thy sleep, That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow	 Like bubbles in a late-disturbèd stream, And in thy face strange motions have appeared, Such as we see when men restrain their breath On some great sudden hest. 

O, what portents are these?Some heavy business hath my lord in hand, And I must know it, else he loves me not. 

HOTSPUR What, ho! 

<ACTION>Enter a Servant.</ACTION> 

Is Gilliams with the packet gone? 

SERVANT He is, my lord, an hour ago.	 

HOTSPUR Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff? 

SERVANT One horse, my lord, he brought even now. 

HOTSPUR What horse? A roan, a crop-ear, is it not? 

SERVANT It is, my lord. 

HOTSPUR That roan shall be my throne.	 Well, I will back him straight. O, Esperance! Bid Butler lead him forth into the park. <ACTION>Servant exits.</ACTION> 

LADY PERCY But hear you, my lord. 

HOTSPUR   What say’st thou, my lady? 

LADY PERCY  What is it carries you away?	 

HOTSPUR Why, my horse, my love, my horse. 

LADY PERCY Out, you mad-headed ape! A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen As you are tossed with. In faith, I’ll know your business, Harry, that I will.	 I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir About his title, and hath sent for you To line his enterprise; but if you go— 

HOTSPUR So far afoot, I shall be weary, love. 

LADY PERCY Come, come, you paraquito, answer me	 Directly unto this question that I ask. In faith, I’ll break thy little finger, Harry, An if thou wilt not tell me all things true. 

HOTSPUR Away! Away, you trifler. Love, I love thee not.	 I care not for thee, Kate. This is no world To play with mammets and to tilt with lips. We must have bloody noses and cracked crowns, And pass them current too.—Gods me, my horse!— What say’st thou, Kate? What wouldst thou have	 with me? 

LADY PERCY Do you not love me? Do you not indeed? Well, do not then, for since you love me not, I will not love myself. Do you not love me? Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.	 

HOTSPUR Come, wilt thou see me ride? And when I am a-horseback I will swear I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate, I must not have you henceforth question me Whither I go, nor reason whereabout. Whither I must, I must; and to conclude This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate. I know you wise, but yet no farther wise Than Harry Percy’s wife; constant you are, But yet a woman; and for secrecy	 No lady closer, for I well believe Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know, And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate. 

LADY PERCY How? So far? 

HOTSPUR Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate,	 Whither I go, thither shall you go too. Today will I set forth, tomorrow you. Will this content you, Kate? 

LADY PERCY It must, of force. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
