Chapter 4.LI. 

The world is ashamed of being virtuous--my uncle Toby knew little of the world; and therefore when he felt he was in love with widow Wadman, he had no conception that the thing was any more to be made a mystery of, than if Mrs. Wadman had given him a cut with a gap'd knife across his finger: Had it been otherwise--yet as he ever look'd upon Trim as a humble friend; and saw fresh reasons every day of his life, to treat him as such--it would have made no variation in the manner in which he informed him of the affair. 

'I am in love, corporal!' quoth my uncle Toby.
