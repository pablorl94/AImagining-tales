<ACTION>Enter Viola, a Captain, and Sailors.</ACTION> 

VIOLA What country, friends, is this? 

CAPTAIN  This is Illyria, lady. 

VIOLA And what should I do in Illyria? My brother he is in Elysium. Perchance he is not drowned.—What think you,	 sailors? 

CAPTAIN It is perchance that you yourself were saved. 

VIOLA O, my poor brother! And so perchance may he be. 

CAPTAIN True, madam. And to comfort you with chance, Assure yourself, after our ship did split,	 When you and those poor number saved with you Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother, Most provident in peril, bind himself (Courage and hope both teaching him the practice) To a strong mast that lived upon the sea,	 Where, like Arion on the dolphin’s back, I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves So long as I could see. 

VIOLA ,  <ACTION>giving him money</ACTION> For saying so, there’s gold. Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,	 Whereto thy speech serves for authority, The like of him. Know’st thou this country? 

CAPTAIN Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born Not three hours’ travel from this very place. 

VIOLA Who governs here?	 

CAPTAIN A noble duke, in nature as in name. 

VIOLA What is his name? 

CAPTAIN Orsino. 

VIOLA Orsino. I have heard my father name him. He was a bachelor then.	 

CAPTAIN And so is now, or was so very late; For but a month ago I went from hence, And then ’twas fresh in murmur (as, you know, What great ones do the less will prattle of) That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.	 

VIOLA  What’s she? 

CAPTAIN A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her In the protection of his son, her brother, Who shortly also died, for whose dear love,	 They say, she hath abjured the sight And company of men. 

VIOLA O, that I served that lady, And might not be delivered to the world Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,	 What my estate is. 

CAPTAIN That were hard to compass Because she will admit no kind of suit, No, not the Duke’s. 

VIOLA There is a fair behavior in thee, captain,	 And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character. I prithee—and I’ll pay thee bounteously—	 Conceal me what I am, and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent. I’ll serve this duke. Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him. It may be worth thy pains, for I can sing	 And speak to him in many sorts of music That will allow me very worth his service. What else may hap, to time I will commit. Only shape thou thy silence to my wit. 

CAPTAIN Be you his eunuch, and your mute I’ll be.	 When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see. 

VIOLA I thank thee. Lead me on.
