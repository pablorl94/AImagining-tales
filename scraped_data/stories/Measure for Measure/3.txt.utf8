<ACTION>Enter Isabella and Francisca, a Nun.</ACTION> 

ISABELLA And have you nuns no farther privileges? 

NUN Are not these large enough? 

ISABELLA Yes, truly. I speak not as desiring more, But rather wishing a more strict restraint Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.	 

LUCIO ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> Ho, peace be in this place! 

ISABELLA  Who’s that which calls? 

NUN It is a man’s voice. Gentle Isabella, Turn you the key and know his business of him. You may; I may not. You are yet unsworn. When you have vowed, you must not speak with men But in the presence of the Prioress. Then, if you speak, you must not show your face; Or if you show your face, you must not speak. He calls again. I pray you answer him.	 

ISABELLA Peace and prosperity! Who is ’t that calls? 

<ACTION>Enter Lucio.</ACTION> 

LUCIO Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses Proclaim you are no less. Can you so stead me As bring me to the sight of Isabella, A novice of this place and the fair sister	 To her unhappy brother, Claudio? 

ISABELLA Why “her unhappy brother”? Let me ask, The rather for I now must make you know I am that Isabella, and his sister. 

LUCIO Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you.	 Not to be weary with you, he’s in prison. 

ISABELLA Woe me, for what? 

LUCIO For that which, if myself might be his judge, He should receive his punishment in thanks: He hath got his friend with child.	 

ISABELLA Sir, make me not your story. 

LUCIO ’Tis true. I would not, though ’tis my familiar sin With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest, Tongue far from heart, play with all virgins so.	 I hold you as a thing enskied and sainted, By your renouncement an immortal spirit, And to be talked with in sincerity As with a saint. 

ISABELLA You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.	 

LUCIO Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, ’tis thus: Your brother and his lover have embraced; As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time That from the seedness the bare fallow brings To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb	 Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry. 

ISABELLA Someone with child by him? My cousin Juliet? 

LUCIO  Is she your cousin? 

ISABELLA Adoptedly, as schoolmaids change their names By vain though apt affection.	 

LUCIO She it is. 

ISABELLA O, let him marry her! 

LUCIO This is the point. The Duke is very strangely gone from hence; Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,	 In hand, and hope of action; but we do learn, By those that know the very nerves of state, His givings-out were of an infinite distance From his true-meant design. Upon his place, And with full line of his authority,	 Governs Lord Angelo, a man whose blood Is very snow-broth; one who never feels The wanton stings and motions of the sense, But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge With profits of the mind: study and fast.	 He—to give fear to use and liberty, Which have for long run by the hideous law As mice by lions—hath picked out an act Under whose heavy sense your brother’s life Falls into forfeit. He arrests him on it,	 And follows close the rigor of the statute To make him an example. All hope is gone Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer To soften Angelo. And that’s my pith of business ’Twixt you and your poor brother.	 

ISABELLA Doth he so Seek his life? 

LUCIO Has censured him already, And, as I hear, the Provost hath a warrant For ’s execution.	 

ISABELLA Alas, what poor ability’s in me To do him good? 

LUCIO Assay the power you have. 

ISABELLA My power? Alas, I doubt— 

LUCIO  Our doubts are traitors	 And makes us lose the good we oft might win By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo And let him learn to know, when maidens sue Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel, All their petitions are as freely theirs	 As they themselves would owe them. 

ISABELLA I’ll see what I can do. 

LUCIO But speedily! 

ISABELLA I will about it straight, No longer staying but to give the Mother	 Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you. Commend me to my brother. Soon at night I’ll send him certain word of my success. 

LUCIO I take my leave of you. 

ISABELLA  Good sir, adieu.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
