SCENE XI.--HARPAGON, MARIANNE, ÉLISE, CLÉANTE, VALÈRE, FROSINE, BRINDAVOINE. 

HAR. Here is my son, who also comes to pay his respects to you. 

MAR. (_aside to_ FROSINE). Oh, Frosine! what a strange meeting! He is the very one of whom I spoke to you. 

FRO. (_to_ MARIANNE). Well, that is extraordinary. 

HAR. You are surprised to see that my children can be so old; but I shall soon get rid of both of them. 

CLE. (_to_ MARIANNE). Madam, to tell you the truth, I little expected such an event; and my father surprised me not a little when he told me to-day of the decision he had come to. 

MAR. I can say the same thing. It is an unexpected meeting; and I certainly was far from being prepared for such an event. 

CLE. Madam, my father cannot make a better choice, and it is a great joy to me to have the honour of welcoming you here. At the same time, I cannot say that I should rejoice if it were your intention to become my stepmother. I must confess that I should find it difficult to pay you the compliment; and it is a title, forgive me, that I cannot wish you to have. To some this speech would seem coarse, but I feel that you understand it. This marriage, Madam, is altogether repugnant to me. You are not ignorant, now that you know who I am, how opposed it is to all my own interests, and with my father's permission I hope you will allow me to say that, if things depended on me, it would never take place. 

HAR. (_aside_). What a very impertinent speech to make; and what a confession to make to her! 

MAR. And as my answer, I must tell you that things are much the same with me, and that, if you have any repugnance in seeing me your stepmother, I shall have no less in seeing you my stepson. Do not believe, I beg of you, that it is of my own will that this trouble has come upon you. I should be deeply grieved to cause you the least sorrow, and unless I am forced to it by a power I must obey, I give you my word that, I will never consent to a marriage which is so painful to you. 

HAR. She is right. A foolish speech deserves a foolish answer. I beg your pardon, my love, for the impertinence of my son. He is a silly young fellow, who has not yet learnt the value of his own words. 

MAR. I assure you that he has not at all offended me. I am thankful, on the contrary, that he has spoken so openly. I care greatly for such a confession from him, and if he had spoken differently, I should feel much less esteem for him. 

HAR. It is very kind of you to excuse him thus. Time will make him wiser, and you will see that his feelings will change. 

CLE. No, father, they will never change; and I earnestly beg of you, Madam, to believe me. 

HAR. Did ever anybody see such folly? He is becoming worse and worse. 

CLE. Would you have me false to my inmost feelings? 

HAR. Again! Change your manners, if you please. 

CLE. Very well, since you wish me to speak differently. Allow me, Madam, to take for a moment my father's place; and forgive me if I tell you that I never saw in the world anybody more charming than you are; that I can understand no happiness to equal that of pleasing you, and that to be your husband is a glory, a felicity, I should prefer to the destinies of the greatest princes upon earth. Yes, Madam, to possess you is, in my mind, to possess the best of all treasures; to obtain you is all my ambition. There is nothing I would not do for so precious a conquest, and the most powerful obstacles ... 

HAR. Gently, gently, my son, if you please. 

CLE. These are complimentary words which I speak to her in your name. 

HAR. Bless me! I have a tongue of my own to explain my feelings, and I really don't care for such an advocate as you... Here, bring us some chairs. 

FRO. No; I think it is better for us to go at once to the fair, in order to be back earlier, and have plenty of time for talking. 

HAR. (_to_ BRINDAVOINE). Have the carriage ready at once.
