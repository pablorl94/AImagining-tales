Chapter 4.LIV. 

--But your honour's two razors shall be new set--and I will get my Montero cap furbish'd up, and put on poor lieutenant Le Fever's regimental coat, which your honour gave me to wear for his sake--and as soon as your honour is clean shaved--and has got your clean shirt on, with your blue and gold, or your fine scarlet--sometimes one and sometimes t'other--and every thing is ready for the attack--we'll march up boldly, as if 'twas to the face of a bastion; and whilst your honour engages Mrs. Wadman in the parlour, to the right--I'll attack Mrs. Bridget in the kitchen, to the left; and having seiz'd the pass, I'll answer for it, said the corporal, snapping his fingers over his head--that the day is our own. 

I wish I may but manage it right; said my uncle Toby--but I declare, corporal, I had rather march up to the very edge of a trench-- 

--A woman is quite a different thing--said the corporal. 

--I suppose so, quoth my uncle Toby.
