PROLOGUE In Troy there lies the scene. From isles of Greece The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed, Have to the port of Athens sent their ships Fraught with the ministers and instruments Of cruel war. Sixty and nine, that wore	 Their crownets regal, from th’ Athenian bay Put forth toward Phrygia, and their vow is made To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures The ravished Helen, Menelaus’ queen, With wanton Paris sleeps; and that’s the quarrel. To Tenedos they come, And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge Their warlike fraughtage. Now on Dardan plains The fresh and yet unbruisèd Greeks do pitch Their brave pavilions. Priam’s six-gated city—	 Dardan and Timbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien, And Antenorides—with massy staples And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts, Spar up the sons of Troy. Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits	 On one and other side, Trojan and Greek, Sets all on hazard. 

And hither am I come, A prologue armed, but not in confidence Of author’s pen or actor’s voice, but suited In like conditions as our argument,	 To tell you, fair beholders, that our play Leaps o’er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils, Beginning in the middle, starting thence away To what may be digested in a play.Like, or find fault; do as your pleasures are. Now, good or bad, ’tis but the chance of war.
