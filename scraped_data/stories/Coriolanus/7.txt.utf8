<ACTION>Alarum, as in battle. Enter Martius and Aufidius at several doors. </ACTION> 

MARTIUS I’ll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee Worse than a promise-breaker. 

AUFIDIUS We hate alike. Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.	 

MARTIUS Let the first budger die the other’s slave, And the gods doom him after! 

AUFIDIUS If I fly, Martius, Hollo me like a hare. 

MARTIUS Within these three hours,	 Tullus, Alone I fought in your Corioles’ walls And made what work I pleased. ’Tis not my blood Wherein thou seest me masked. For thy revenge, Wrench up thy power to th’ highest.	 

AUFIDIUS Wert thou the Hector That was the whip of your bragged progeny, Thou shouldst not scape me here. 

<ACTION>Here they fight, and certain Volsces come inthe aid of Aufidius.</ACTION>

<ACTION>Martius fights till they be driven in breathless.Aufidius and Martius exit, separately.</ACTION>
