CANTO XVIII. 

Of iron colour, and composed of stone, A place called Malebolge[515] is in Hell, Girt by a cliff of substance like its own. In that malignant region yawns a well[516] Right in the centre, ample and profound; Of which I duly will the structure tell. The zone[517] that lies between them, then, is round-- Between the well and precipice hard and high; Into ten vales divided is the ground. As is the figure offered to the eye,                              10 Where numerous moats a castle's towers enclose That they the walls may better fortify; A like appearance was made here by those. And as, again, from threshold of such place Many a drawbridge to the outworks goes; So ridges from the precipice's base Cutting athwart the moats and barriers run, Till at the well join the extremities. [518] From Geryon's back when we were shaken down 'Twas here we stood, until the Poet's feet                      20 Moved to the left, and I, behind, came on. New torments on the right mine eyes did meet With new tormentors, novel woe on woe; With which the nearer Bolgia was replete. 

Sinners, all naked, in the gulf below, This side the middle met us; while they strode On that side with us, but more swift did go.[519] Even so the Romans, that the mighty crowd Across the bridge, the year of Jubilee, Might pass with ease, ordained a rule of road[520]--            30 Facing the Castle, on that side should be The multitude which to St. Peter's hied; So to the Mount on this was passage free. On the grim rocky ground, on either side, I saw horned devils[521] armed with heavy whip Which on the sinners from behind they plied. Ah, how they made the wretches nimbly skip At the first lashes; no one ever yet But sought from the second and the third to slip. And as I onward went, mine eyes were set                          40 On one of them; whereon I called in haste: 'This one already I have surely met!' Therefore to know him, fixedly I gazed; And my kind Leader willingly delayed, While for a little I my course retraced. 

On this the scourged one, thinking to evade My search, his visage bent without avail, For: 'Thou that gazest on the ground,' I said, 'If these thy features tell trustworthy tale, Venedico Caccianimico[522] thou!50 But what has brought thee to such sharp regale? '[523] And he, 'I tell it 'gainst my will, I trow, But thy clear accents[524] to the old world bear My memory, and make me all avow. I was the man who Ghisola the fair To serve the Marquis' evil will led on, Whatever[525] the uncomely tale declare. Of Bolognese here weeping not alone Am I; so full the place of them, to-day 'Tween Reno and Savena[526] are not known                       60 So many tongues that _Sipa_ deftly say: And if of this thou'dst know the reason why, Think but how greedy were our hearts alway.' To him thus speaking did a demon cry: 'Pander, begone!' and smote him with his thong; 'Here are no women for thy coin to buy.' Then, with my Escort joined, I moved along. Few steps we made until we there had come, Where from the bank a rib of rock was flung. 

With ease enough up to its top we clomb,                          70 And, turning on the ridge, bore to the right;[527] And those eternal circles[528] parted from.When we had reached where underneath the height A passage opes, yielding the scourged a way, My Guide bade: 'Tarry, so to hold in sight Those other spirits born in evil day, Whose faces until now from thee have been Concealed, because with ours their progress lay.' Then from the ancient bridge by us were seen The troop which toward us on that circuit sped,                 80 Chased onward, likewise, by the scourges keen. And my good Master, ere I asked him, said: 'That lordly one now coming hither, see, By whom, despite of pain, no tears are shed. What mien he still retains of majesty! 'Tis Jason, who by courage and by guile The Colchians of the ram deprived. 'Twas he Who on his passage by the Lemnian isle, Where all of womankind with daring hand Upon their males had wrought a murder vile,                     90 With loving pledges and with speeches bland The tender-yeared Hypsipyle betrayed, Who had herself a fraud on others planned. Forlorn he left her then, when pregnant made. 

That is the crime condemns him to this pain; And for Medea[529] too is vengeance paid.Who in his manner cheat compose his train. Of the first moat sufficient now is known, And those who in its jaws engulfed remain.' Already had we by the strait path gone                           100 To where 'tis with the second bank dovetailed-- The buttress whence a second arch is thrown. Here heard we who in the next Bolgia wailed[530] And puffed for breath; reverberations told They with their open palms themselves assailed. The sides were crusted over with a mould Plastered upon them by foul mists that rise, And both with eyes and nose a contest hold. The bottom is so deep, in vain our eyes Searched it till further up the bridge we went,                110 To where the arch o'erhangs what under lies. Ascended there, our eyes we downward bent, And I saw people in such ordure drowned, A very cesspool 'twas of excrement. And while I from above am searching round, One with a head so filth-smeared I picked out, I knew not if 'twas lay, or tonsure-crowned. 'Why then so eager,' asked he with a shout, 'To stare at me of all the filthy crew?' 

And I to him: 'Because I scarce can doubt                      120 That formerly thee dry of hair I knew, Alessio Interminei[531] the Lucchese; And therefore thee I chiefly hold in view.'Smiting his head-piece, then, his words were these: ''Twas flattery steeped me here; for, using such, My tongue itself enough could never please.' 'Now stretch thou somewhat forward, but not much,' Thereon my Leader bade me, 'and thine eyes Slowly advance till they her features touch And the dishevelled baggage recognise,                           130 Clawing her yonder with her nails unclean, Now standing up, now squatting on her thighs. 'Tis harlot Thais,[532] who, when she had been Asked by her lover, "Am I generous And worthy thanks?" said, "Greatly so, I ween." Enough[533] of this place has been seen by us.'
