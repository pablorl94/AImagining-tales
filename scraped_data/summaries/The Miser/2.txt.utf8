Harpagon, Cléante and Élise's father, comes onstage with a young man named La Flèche, which translates to English as The Arrow. Cool name, or coolest name?

Harpagon yells at the young man to get out of his house immediately, because he thinks that La Flèche is spying on him in order to find out where he keeps his money. Whoa there, Harpagon.

La Flèche doesn't know what the old man is talking about, but Harpagon is beyond paranoid when it comes to his money.

La Flèche assures Harpagon that he couldn't care less whether there is any money hidden around the house.

When La Flèche finally agrees to leave, however, Harpagon becomes paranoid that the young man already has some stolen cash on him, and commands him to stay where he is. Harpagon then gives La Flèche a full TSA-style pat down, searching every nook and cranny.

La Flèche curses all old misers and their miserly ways. It takes Harpagon more than a second, though, to realize that he is the miser La Flèche is talking about.

Harpagon warns La Flèche not to say another word. After one final interrogation, he tells the young man to get out of his house.
