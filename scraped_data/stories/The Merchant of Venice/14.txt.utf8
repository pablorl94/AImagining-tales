<ACTION>Enter Shylock, the Jew, and Solanio, and Antonio,and the Jailer.</ACTION> 

SHYLOCK Jailer, look to him. Tell not me of mercy. This is the fool that lent out money gratis. Jailer, look to him. 

ANTONIO Hear me yet, good Shylock— 

SHYLOCK I’ll have my bond. Speak not against my bond.	 I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond. Thou call’dst me dog before thou hadst a cause, But since I am a dog, beware my fangs. The Duke shall grant me justice.—I do wonder, Thou naughty jailer, that thou art so fond	 To come abroad with him at his request. 

ANTONIO I pray thee, hear me speak— 

SHYLOCK I’ll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak. I’ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more. I’ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,	 To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield To Christian intercessors. Follow not! I’ll have no speaking. I will have my bond.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

SOLANIO It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men.	 

ANTONIO Let him alone. I’ll follow him no more with bootless prayers. He seeks my life. His reason well I know: I oft delivered from his forfeitures Many that have at times made moan to me.	 Therefore he hates me. 

SOLANIO I am sure the Duke Will never grant this forfeiture to hold. 

ANTONIO The Duke cannot deny the course of law, For the commodity that strangers have	 With us in Venice, if it be denied, Will much impeach the justice of the state, Since that the trade and profit of the city Consisteth of all nations. Therefore go. These griefs and losses have so bated me	 That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh Tomorrow to my bloody creditor.— Well, jailer, on.—Pray God Bassanio come To see me pay his debt, and then I care not. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
