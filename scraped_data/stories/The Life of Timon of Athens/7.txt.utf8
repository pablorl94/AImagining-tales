<ACTION>Enter Varro’s two Men, meeting Titus and others, allbeing Men of Timon’s creditors to wait for his comingout. Then enter Lucius’ Man and Hortensius.</ACTION> 

VARRO’S FIRST MAN Well met. Good morrow, Titus and Hortensius. 

TITUS The like to you, kind Varro. 

HORTENSIUS Lucius! What, do we meet together? 

LUCIUS’ MAN Ay, and I think	 One business does command us all, For mine is money. 

TITUS  So is theirs and ours. 

<ACTION>Enter Philotus.</ACTION> 

LUCIUS’ MAN And, sir, Philotus’ too. 

PHILOTUS Good day at once.	 

LUCIUS’ MAN  Welcome, good brother. What do you think the hour? 

PHILOTUS Laboring for nine. 

LUCIUS’ MAN So much? 

PHILOTUS Is not my lord seen yet? 

LUCIUS’ MAN  Not yet. 

PHILOTUS I wonder on ’t. He was wont to shine at seven. 

LUCIUS’ MAN Ay, but the days are waxed shorter with him. You must consider that a prodigal course Is like the sun’s,	 But not, like his, recoverable. I fear ’Tis deepest winter in Lord Timon’s purse: That is, one may reach deep enough and yet Find little. 

PHILOTUS I am of your fear for that.	 

TITUS I’ll show you how t’ observe a strange event. Your lord sends now for money? 

HORTENSIUS Most true, he does. 

TITUS And he wears jewels now of Timon’s gift, For which I wait for money.	 

HORTENSIUS It is against my heart. 

LUCIUS’ MAN Mark how strange it shows: Timon in this should pay more than he owes, And e’en as if your lord should wear rich jewels And send for money for ’em.	 

HORTENSIUS I’m weary of this charge, the gods can witness. I know my lord hath spent of Timon’s wealth, And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth. 

VARRO’S FIRST MAN Yes, mine’s three thousand crowns. What’s yours? 

LUCIUS’ MAN  Five thousand mine.	 

VARRO’S FIRST MAN ’Tis much deep, and it should seem by th’ sum Your master’s confidence was above mine, Else surely his had equaled. 

<ACTION>Enter Flaminius.</ACTION> 

TITUS One of Lord Timon’s men. 

LUCIUS’ MAN Flaminius? Sir, a word. Pray, is my lord	 ready to come forth? 

FLAMINIUS  No, indeed he is not. 

TITUS  We attend his Lordship. Pray, signify so much. 

FLAMINIUS I need not tell him that. He knows you are too diligent.   

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Flavius, the Steward in a cloak, muffled.</ACTION> 

LUCIUS’ MAN Ha! Is not that his steward muffled so? He goes away in a cloud. Call him, call him. 

TITUS Do you hear, sir? 

VARRO’S SECOND MAN  By your leave, sir. 

FLAVIUS  What do you ask of me, my friend?	 

TITUS We wait for certain money here, sir. 

FLAVIUS Ay, If money were as certain as your waiting, ’Twere sure enough. Why then preferred you not your sums and bills	 When your false masters eat of my lord’s meat? Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts And take down th’ int’rest into their glutt’nous maws. You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up. Let me pass quietly.	 Believe ’t, my lord and I have made an end. I have no more to reckon, he to spend. 

LUCIUS’ MAN  Ay, but this answer will not serve. 

FLAVIUS If ’twill not serve, ’tis not so base as you, For you serve knaves.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

VARRO’S FIRST MAN How? What does his cashiered Worship mutter? 

VARRO’S SECOND MAN No matter what. He’s poor, and that’s revenge enough. Who can speak broader than he that has no house to put his head in? Such	 may rail against great buildings. 

<ACTION>Enter Servilius.</ACTION> 

TITUS  O, here’s Servilius. Now we shall know some answer. 

SERVILIUS If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some other hour, I should derive much from ’t. For	 take ’t of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to discontent. His comfortable temper has forsook him. He’s much out of health and keeps his chamber. 

LUCIUS’ MAN Many do keep their chambers are not sick; And if it be so far beyond his health,	 Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts And make a clear way to the gods. 

SERVILIUS Good gods! 

TITUS We cannot take this for answer, sir. 

FLAMINIUS ,  <ACTION>within </ACTION> Servilius, help! My lord, my lord!	 

<ACTION>Enter Timon in a rage.</ACTION> 

TIMON What, are my doors opposed against my passage? Have I been ever free, and must my house Be my retentive enemy, my jail? The place which I have feasted, does it now, Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?	 

LUCIUS’ MAN  Put in now, Titus. 

TITUS  My lord, here is my bill. 

LUCIUS’ MAN Here’s mine. 

HORTENSIUS  And mine, my lord. 

VARRO’S SECOND MAN And ours, my lord.	 

PHILOTUS  All our bills. 

TIMON Knock me down with ’em! Cleave me to the girdle. 

LUCIUS’ MAN Alas, my lord— 

TIMON  Cut my heart in sums! 

TITUS Mine, fifty talents.	 

TIMON Tell out my blood. 

LUCIUS’ MAN Five thousand crowns, my lord. 

TIMON Five thousand drops pays that.—What yours?—And yours? 

VARRO’S FIRST MAN  My lord—	 

VARRO’S SECOND MAN My lord— 

TIMON Tear me, take me, and the gods fall upon you! 

<ACTION>Timon exits.</ACTION> 

HORTENSIUS  Faith, I perceive our masters may throw their caps at their money. These debts may well be called desperate ones, for a madman owes ’em.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Timon and Flavius.</ACTION> 

TIMON They have e’en put my breath from me, the slaves! Creditors? Devils! 

FLAVIUS  My dear lord— 

TIMON What if it should be so? 

FLAVIUS  My lord—	 

TIMON I’ll have it so.—My steward! 

FLAVIUS Here, my lord. 

TIMON So fitly? Go, bid all my friends again, Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius, all. I’ll once more feast the rascals.	 

FLAVIUS  O my lord, You only speak from your distracted soul. There’s not so much left to furnish out A moderate table. 

TIMON  Be it not in thy care. Go,	 I charge thee, invite them all. Let in the tide Of knaves once more. My cook and I’ll provide. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
