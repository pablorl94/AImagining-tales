_Enter_ CHRYSOTHEMIS. 

CHR. Driven by delight, dear sister, I am come, Reckless of dignity, with headlong speed. For news I bear of joy and sweet relief From ills that drew from thee thy ceaseless moan. 

EL. Whence couldst thou hear of succour for my woes, That close in darkness without hope of dawn? 

CHR. Here is Orestes, learn it from my mouth, As certainly as you now look on me. 

EL. What? Art thou mad, unhappy one, to laugh Over thine own calamity and mine? 

CHR. No, by our father's hearth, I say not this In mockery. I tell you he is come. 

EL. Me miserable! Who hath given thine ear The word that so hath wrought on thy belief? 

CHR. Myself am the eyewitness, no one else Gained my belief, but proofs I clearly saw. 

EL. What sign hath so engrossed thine eye, poor girl? What sight hath fired thee with this quenchless glow? 

CHR. But list to me, I pray thee, that henceforth Thou mayest account me clear eyed, or a fool! 

EL. By all means, if it pleasure thee, say on. 

CHR. Well, I will tell thee all I saw:--I came Unto the ancient tomb that holds our sire; And from the topmost mound I marked a stream Of milk fresh-flowing, and his resting place Ringed round with garlands of all flowers that blow. I marvelled at the sight, and peered about, Lest some one might be nearer than we knew. But finding all was quiet in the spot, I ventured closer to the tomb, and there, Hard by the limit, I beheld a curl Of hair new shorn, with all the gloss of youth And straight it struck my heart, as with a sense Of something seen, ah me! long, long ago, And told me that my sight encountered here The token of Orestes, dearest soul Then, clasping it, I did not cry aloud, But straight mine eyes were filled with tears of joy. And now as much as then I feel assured He and none else bestowed this ornament. To whom beyond thyself and me belongs Such consecration? And I know this well, I did it not,--nor thou. Impossible! Thou canst not worship even the blessèd Gods Forth of this roof, unpunished. 

And, most sure, Our mother is not minded so to act, Nor, had she done it, could we fail to know.This offering comes then of Orestes' hand. Take courage, dear one. Not one fate pursues One house perpetually, but changeth still. Ours was a sullen Genius, but perchance This day begins the assurance of much good. 

EL. Oh how I pity thine infatuate mind! 

CHR. Why? Dost thou find no comfort in my news? 

EL. You know not where you roam. Far wide! far wide! 

CHR. Not know? when I have seen it with mine eyes? 

EL. Dear, he is dead. Look not to him, poor girl! Salvation comes to thee no more from him. 

CHR. Oh me, unfortunate! Who told thee this? 

EL. He who stood by and saw his life destroyed. 

CHR. Amazement seizes me. Where is that man? 

EL. Right welcome to the mother there within. 

CHR. Me miserable! Who then can have decked With all those ceremonies our father's tomb? 

EL. I cannot but suppose some hand hath brought These gifts in memory of Orestes dead. 

CHR. O cruel fate! While I in ecstasy Sped with such news, all ignorant, it seems, Of our dire fortune; and, arriving, find Fresh sorrows added to the former woe. 

EL. It is so, sister; yet if thou wilt list To me, thou mayest disperse this heaviness. 

CHR. What? Shall I raise the dead again to life? 

EL. I did not mean so. I am not so fond. 

CHR. What bid you then that I have power to do? 

EL. To endure courageously what I enjoin. 

CHR. So it make profit, I will not refuse. 

EL. Remember, without toil no plan may thrive! 

CHR. I know it, and will aid thee to my power. 

EL. Then hearken my resolve. Thou seëst now, We have no friendly succour in the world; But death has taken all, and we are left Two only. I, so long as I could hear My brother lived and flourished, still had hope He would arise to wreak his father's blood. But now that he is gone, to thee I turn, To help thy sister boldly to destroy The guilty author of our father's death, Aegisthus.--Wherefore hide it from thee now? --Yea, sister! Till what term wilt thou remain Inactive? To what end? What hope is yet Left standing? Surely thou hast cause to grieve, Bobbed of thy father's opulent heritage, And feeling bitterly the creeping years That find thee still a virgin and unwed. Nay, nor imagine thou shalt ever know That blessing. Not so careless of his life Is King Aegisthus, as to risk the birth Of sons from us, to his most certain fall. But if thou wilt but follow my resolve, First thou shalt win renown of piety From our dead father, and our brother too, Who rest beneath the ground, and shalt be free For evermore in station as in birth, And nobly matched in marriage, for the good Draw gazers to them still. 

Then seest thou not What meed of honour, if thou dost my will, Thou shalt apportion to thyself and me?For who, beholding us, what citizen, What foreigner, will not extend the hand Of admiration, and exclaim, 'See, friends, These scions of one stock, these noble twain, These that have saved their father's house from woe, Who once when foes were mighty, set their life Upon a cast, and stood forth to avenge The stain of blood! Who will not love the pair And do them reverence? Who will not give Honour at festivals, and in the throng Of popular resort, to these in chief, For their high courage and their bold emprise?' Such fame will follow us in all the world. Living or dying, still to be renowned. Ah, then, comply, dear sister; give thy sire This toil--this labour to thy brother give; End these my sufferings, end thine own regret: The well-born cannot bear to live in shame. 

CH. In such affairs, for those who speak and hear Wise thoughtfulness is still the best ally. 

CHR. True, noble women, and before she spake Sound thought should have prevented the rash talk That now hath proved her reckless. What wild aim Beckons thee forth in arming this design Whereto thou wouldst demand my ministry? Dost not perceive, thou art not man but woman, Of strength inferior to thine enemies,-- Their Genius daily prospering more and more, Whilst ours is dwindling into nothingness? Who then that plots against a life so strong Shall quit him of the danger without harm? Take heed we do not add to our distress Should some one hear of this our colloquy. Small help and poor advantage 'twere for us To win brief praise and then inglorious die. Nay, death is not so hateful as when one Desiring death is balked of that desire. And I beseech thee, ere in utter ruin We perish and make desolate our race, Refrain thy rage. And I will guard for thee In silence these thy words unrealized; If thou wilt learn this wisdom from long time, Having no strength, to bend before the strong. 

CH. Comply. Than prudence and a heedful mind, No fairer treasure can be found for men. 

EL. Thy words have not surprised me. Well I knew The good I offered would come back with scorn. I, all alone and with a single hand, Must do this. For it shall not rest undone. 

CHR. Would thou hadst been thus minded when our sire Lay dying! In one act thou hadst compassed all. 

EL. My spirit was the same: my mind was less. 

CHR. Be such the life-long temper of thy mind! 

EL. Thine admonition augurs little aid. 

CHR. Yea. For the attempt would bring me certain bane. 

EL. I envy thee thy prudence, hate thy fear. 

CHR. Even when thou speak'st me fair, I will endure it. 

EL. Take heart. That never will be thine from me. 

CHR. Long time remains to settle that account. 

EL. I find no profit in thee. Go thy way. 

CHR. Profit there is, hadst thou a mind to learn. 

EL. Go to thy mother and declare all this! 

CHR. I am not so in hatred of thy life. 

EL. Yet know the shame thou wouldst prepare for me. 

CHR. No, no! Not shame, but care for thine estate. 

EL. Must I still follow as thou thinkest good? 

CHR. When thou hast wisdom, thou shalt be the guide. 

EL. 'Tis hard when error wears the garb of sense. 

CHR. Right. That is the misfortune of your case. 

EL. Why? Feel you not the justice of my speech? 

CHR. Justice may chance to bring me injury. 

EL. I care not, I, to live by such a rule. 

CHR. Well, if you do it, you will find me wise. 

EL. Well, I will do it, nought dismayed by thee. 

CHR. Speak you plain sooth? and will you not be counselled? 

EL. No, for bad counsel is of all most hateful. 

CHR. You take the sense of nothing that I say. 

EL. Long since, not newly, my resolve is firm. 

CHR. Then I will go. Thy heart will ne'er be brought To praise my words, nor I thine action here. 

EL. Then go within! I will not follow thee, Though thou desire it vehemently. None Would be so fond to hunt on a cold trail. 

CHR. If this seem wisdom to thee, then be wise Thy way: but in the hour of misery, When it hath caught thee, thou wilt praise my words. [_Exit_ CHRYSOTHEMIS 

CHORUS. Wise are the birds of air                                I 1 That with true filial care For those provide convenient food Who gave them birth, who wrought their good. Why will not men the like perfection prove? Else, by the fires above, And heavenly Rectitude, Fierce recompense they shall not long elude. O darkling rumour, world-o'er-wandering voice That piercest to the shades beneath the ground, To dead Atrides waft a sound Of sad reproach, not bidding him rejoice. 

Stained is the ancestral hall,                           I 2 Broken the battle-call, That heretofore his children twain In loving concord did sustain. Alone, deserted, vexed, Electra sails, Storm-tossed with rugged gales, Lamenting evermore Like piteous Philomel, and pining sore For her lost father;--might she but bring down That two-fold Fury, caring not for death, But ready to resign her breath, What maid so worthy of a sire's renown? 

None who inherit from a noble race,                           II 1 Complying with things base Will let their ancient glory be defiled. So 'twas thy choice, dear child, Through homeless misery[9] to win a two-fold prize, Purging the sin and shame[10] That cloud the Argive name, So to be called most noble and most wise. 

May'st thou surpass thy foes in wealth and power              II 2 As o'er thee now they tower! Since I have found thee, not in bright estate, Nor blessed by wayward fate, But through thy loyalty to Heaven's eternal cause Wearing the stainless crown Of perfectest renown, And richly dowered by the mightiest laws.
