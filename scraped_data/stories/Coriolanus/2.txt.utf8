<ACTION>Enter Volumnia and Virgilia, mother and wifeto Martius. They set them down on two low stoolsand sew.</ACTION> 

VOLUMNIA I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort. If my son were my husband, I should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love. When	 yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when for a day of kings’ entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering how honor would become	 such a person—that it was no better than picture-like to hang by th’ wall, if renown made it not stir—was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he returned, his brows bound with	 oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man. 

VIRGILIA But had he died in the business, madam, how then?	 

VOLUMNIA Then his good report should have been my son; I therein would have found issue. Hear me profess sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my good Martius, I had rather had eleven die nobly	 for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action. 

<ACTION>Enter a Gentlewoman.</ACTION> 

GENTLEWOMAN Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you. 

VIRGILIA Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.	 

VOLUMNIA Indeed you shall not. Methinks I hear hither your husband’s drum, See him pluck Aufidius down by th’ hair; As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him. Methinks I see him stamp thus and call thus:	 “Come on, you cowards! You were got in fear, Though you were born in Rome.” His bloody brow With his mailed hand then wiping, forth he goes Like to a harvestman that’s tasked to mow Or all or lose his hire.	 

VIRGILIA His bloody brow? O Jupiter, no blood! 

VOLUMNIA Away, you fool! It more becomes a man Than gilt his trophy. The breasts of Hecuba, When she did suckle Hector, looked not lovelier Than Hector’s forehead when it spit forth blood	 At Grecian sword, contemning.—Tell Valeria We are fit to bid her welcome.	 <ACTION>Gentlewoman exits.</ACTION> 

VIRGILIA Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius! 

VOLUMNIA He’ll beat Aufidius’ head below his knee And tread upon his neck.	 

<ACTION>Enter Valeria with an Usher and a Gentlewoman.</ACTION> 

VALERIA  My ladies both, good day to you. 

VOLUMNIA Sweet madam. 

VIRGILIA I am glad to see your Ladyship. 

VALERIA How do you both? You are manifest housekeepers. What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in	 good faith. How does your little son? 

VIRGILIA I thank your Ladyship; well, good madam. 

VOLUMNIA He had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look upon his schoolmaster. 

VALERIA O’ my word, the father’s son! I’ll swear ’tis a	 very pretty boy. O’ my troth, I looked upon him o’ Wednesday half an hour together. H’as such a confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded butterfly, and when he caught it, he let it go again, and after it again, and over and over he comes,	 and up again, catched it again. Or whether his fall enraged him or how ’twas, he did so set his teeth and tear it. O, I warrant how he mammocked it! 

VOLUMNIA One on ’s father’s moods. 

VALERIA Indeed, la, ’tis a noble child.	 

VIRGILIA A crack, madam. 

VALERIA Come, lay aside your stitchery. I must have you play the idle huswife with me this afternoon. 

VIRGILIA No, good madam, I will not out of doors. 

VALERIA Not out of doors?	 

VOLUMNIA She shall, she shall. 

VIRGILIA Indeed, no, by your patience. I’ll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars. 

VALERIA Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably. Come, you must go visit the good lady that lies in.	 

VIRGILIA I will wish her speedy strength and visit her with my prayers, but I cannot go thither. 

VOLUMNIA Why, I pray you? 

VIRGILIA ’Tis not to save labor, nor that I want love. 

VALERIA You would be another Penelope. Yet they say	 all the yarn she spun in Ulysses’ absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths. Come, I would your cambric were sensible as your finger, that you might leave pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us. 

VIRGILIA No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will	 not forth. 

VALERIA In truth, la, go with me, and I’ll tell you excellent news of your husband. 

VIRGILIA O, good madam, there can be none yet. 

VALERIA Verily, I do not jest with you. There came	 news from him last night. 

VIRGILIA Indeed, madam! 

VALERIA In earnest, it’s true. I heard a senator speak it. Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth, against whom Cominius the General is gone with one	 part of our Roman power. Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioles. They nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief wars. This is true, on mine honor, and so, I pray, go with us.	 

VIRGILIA Give me excuse, good madam. I will obey you in everything hereafter. 

VOLUMNIA Let her alone, lady. As she is now, she will but disease our better mirth. 

VALERIA In troth, I think she would.—Fare you well,	 then.—Come, good sweet lady.—Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy solemness out o’ door, and go along with us. 

VIRGILIA No, at a word, madam. Indeed, I must not. I wish you much mirth.	 

VALERIA Well, then, farewell.
