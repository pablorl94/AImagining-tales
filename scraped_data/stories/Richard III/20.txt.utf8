<ACTION>Enter Buckingham, with Sheriff and Halberds, led toexecution.</ACTION> 

BUCKINGHAM Will not King Richard let me speak with him? 

SHERIFF No, my good lord. Therefore be patient. 

BUCKINGHAM Hastings and Edward’s children, Grey and Rivers, Holy King Henry and thy fair son Edward, Vaughan, and all that have miscarrièd	 By underhand, corrupted, foul injustice, If that your moody, discontented souls Do through the clouds behold this present hour, Even for revenge mock my destruction.— This is All Souls’ Day, fellow, is it not?	 

SHERIFF It is. 

BUCKINGHAM Why, then, All Souls’ Day is my body’s doomsday. This is the day which, in King Edward’s time, I wished might fall on me when I was found False to his children and his wife’s allies.	 This is the day wherein I wished to fall By the false faith of him whom most I trusted. This, this All Souls’ Day to my fearful soul Is the determined respite of my wrongs. That high All-seer which I dallied with	 Hath turned my feignèd prayer on my head And given in earnest what I begged in jest. Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men To turn their own points in their masters’ bosoms. Thus Margaret’s curse falls heavy on my neck:	 “When he,” quoth she, “shall split thy heart with sorrow, Remember Margaret was a prophetess.”— Come, lead me, officers, to the block of shame. Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.
