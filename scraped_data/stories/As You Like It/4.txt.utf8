<ACTION>Enter Duke Frederick with Lords.</ACTION> 

DUKE FREDERICK Can it be possible that no man saw them? It cannot be. Some villains of my court Are of consent and sufferance in this. 

FIRST LORD I cannot hear of any that did see her. The ladies her attendants of her chamber	 Saw her abed, and in the morning early They found the bed untreasured of their mistress. 

SECOND LORD My lord, the roinish clown at whom so oft Your Grace was wont to laugh is also missing. Hisperia, the Princess’ gentlewoman,	 Confesses that she secretly o’erheard Your daughter and her cousin much commend The parts and graces of the wrestler That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles, And she believes wherever they are gone	 That youth is surely in their company. 

DUKE FREDERICK Send to his brother. Fetch that gallant hither. If he be absent, bring his brother to me. I’ll make him find him. Do this suddenly, And let not search and inquisition quail	 To bring again these foolish runaways. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
