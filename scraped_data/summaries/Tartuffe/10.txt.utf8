Tartuffe enters, talking loudly to his servant Laurent, who is off-stage; he's going to go to the prison, he says, to give money to the prisoners.

Dorine can't stand his pretentiousness.

Tartuffe can't stand the sight of Dorine's breasts, and he gives her a handkerchief to cover her bosom; he says the sight of it creates unclean thoughts – no doubt in his dirty mind.

Dorine calls him out and says that she would feel nothing if he were prancing around naked.

Tartuffe doesn't want to listen to her jibes – and he doesn't have to; Dorine is on her way out. Elmire, she tells him, is headed downstairs to have a chat with him.

When Tartuffe gets too excited about this, Dorine thinks her suspicions have been confirmed. She leaves.
