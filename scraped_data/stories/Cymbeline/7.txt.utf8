<ACTION>Enter Cloten and the two Lords.</ACTION> 

CLOTEN   Was there ever man had such luck? When I kissed the jack, upon an upcast to be hit away? I had a hundred pound on ’t. And then a whoreson jackanapes must take me up for swearing, as if I borrowed mine oaths of him and might not spend	 them at my pleasure. 

FIRST LORD  What got he by that? You have broke his pate with your bowl. 

SECOND LORD ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> If his wit had been like him that broke it, it would have run all out.	 

CLOTEN   When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is not for any standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha? 

SECOND LORD No, my lord,  <ACTION>(aside)</ACTION> nor crop the ears of them. 

CLOTEN   Whoreson dog! I gave him satisfaction. Would	 he had been one of my rank. 

SECOND LORD ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> To have smelled like a fool. 

CLOTEN  I am not vexed more at anything in th’ Earth. A pox on ’t! I had rather not be so noble as I am. They dare not fight with me because of the Queen	 my mother. Every jack-slave hath his bellyful of fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that nobody can match. 

SECOND LORD ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> You are cock and capon too, and you crow cock with your comb on.	 

CLOTEN Sayest thou? 

SECOND LORD  It is not fit your Lordship should undertake every companion that you give offense to. 

CLOTEN No, I know that, but it is fit I should commit offense to my inferiors.	 

SECOND LORD Ay, it is fit for your Lordship only. 

CLOTEN   Why, so I say. 

FIRST LORD  Did you hear of a stranger that’s come to court tonight? 

CLOTEN A stranger, and I not know on ’t?	 

SECOND LORD ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> He’s a strange fellow himself and knows it not. 

FIRST LORD  There’s an Italian come, and ’tis thought one of Leonatus’ friends. 

CLOTEN Leonatus? A banished rascal; and he’s another,	 whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger? 

FIRST LORD One of your Lordship’s pages. 

CLOTEN Is it fit I went to look upon him? Is there no derogation in ’t? 

SECOND LORD  You cannot derogate, my lord.	 

CLOTEN Not easily, I think. 

SECOND LORD ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> You are a fool granted; therefore your issues, being foolish, do not derogate. 

CLOTEN  Come, I’ll go see this Italian. What I have lost today at bowls I’ll win tonight of him. Come, go.	 

SECOND LORD I’ll attend your Lordship. 

<ACTION>Cloten and First Lord exit.</ACTION> 

That such a crafty devil as is his mother Should yield the world this ass! A woman that Bears all down with her brain, and this her son Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,	 And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess, Thou divine Imogen, what thou endur’st, Betwixt a father by thy stepdame governed, A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer More hateful than the foul expulsion is	 Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act Of the divorce he’d make! The heavens hold firm The walls of thy dear honor, keep unshaked That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand T’ enjoy thy banished lord and this great land.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
