<ACTION>Enter a Senator, with papers.</ACTION> 

SENATOR And late five thousand. To Varro and to Isidore He owes nine thousand, besides my former sum, Which makes it five-and-twenty. Still in motion Of raging waste! It cannot hold; it will not. If I want gold, steal but a beggar’s dog	 And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold. If I would sell my horse and buy twenty more Better than he, why, give my horse to Timon— Ask nothing; give it him—it foals me straight, And able horses. No porter at his gate	 But rather one that smiles and still invites All that pass by. It cannot hold. No reason Can sound his state in safety.—Caphis, ho! Caphis, I say! 

<ACTION>Enter Caphis.</ACTION> 

CAPHIS Here, sir. What is your pleasure?	 

SENATOR Get on your cloak and haste you to Lord Timon. Importune him for my moneys. Be not ceased With slight denial, nor then silenced when “Commend me to your master” and the cap Plays in the right hand thus; but tell him	 My uses cry to me. I must serve my turn Out of mine own. His days and times are past, And my reliances on his fracted dates Have smit my credit. I love and honor him But must not break my back to heal his finger.	 Immediate are my needs, and my relief Must not be tossed and turned to me in words But find supply immediate. Get you gone. Put on a most importunate aspect, A visage of demand, for I do fear	 When every feather sticks in his own wing Lord Timon will be left a naked gull, Which flashes now a phoenix. Get you gone. 

CAPHIS  I go, sir. 

SENATOR “I go, sir”? Take the bonds along with you	 And have the dates in. Come. 

<ACTION>He hands Caphis papers.</ACTION> 

CAPHIS I will, sir. 

SENATOR Go. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
