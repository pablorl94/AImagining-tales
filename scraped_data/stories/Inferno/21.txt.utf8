CANTO XXII. 

Horsemen I've seen in march across the field, Hastening to charge, or, answering muster, stand, And sometimes too when forced their ground to yield; I have seen skirmishers upon your land, O Aretines! [594] and those on foray sent; With trumpet and with bell[595] to sound command Have seen jousts run and well-fought tournament, With drum, and signal from the castle shown, And foreign music with familiar blent; But ne'er by blast on such a trumpet blown                        10 Beheld I horse or foot to motion brought, Nor ship by star or landmark guided on. With the ten demons moved we from the spot; Ah, cruel company! but 'with the good In church, and in the tavern with the sot.' Still to the pitch was my attention glued Fully to see what in the Bolgia lay, And who were in its burning mass imbrued. As when the dolphins vaulted backs display, Warning to mariners they should prepare                         20 To trim their vessel ere the storm makes way; So, to assuage the pain he had to bear, Some wretch would show his back above the tide, Then swifter plunge than lightnings cleave the air. 

And as the frogs close to the marsh's side With muzzles thrust out of the water stand, While feet and bodies carefully they hide; So stood the sinners upon every hand.But on beholding Barbariccia nigh Beneath the bubbles[596] disappeared the band. 30 I saw what still my heart is shaken by: One waiting, as it sometimes comes to pass That one frog plunges, one at rest doth lie; And Graffiacan, who nearest to him was, Him upward drew, clutching his pitchy hair: To me he bore the look an otter has. I of their names[597] ere this was well aware, For I gave heed unto the names of all When they at first were chosen. 'Now prepare, And, Rubicante, with thy talons fall                              40 Upon him and flay well,' with many cries And one consent the accursed ones did call. I said: 'O Master, if in any wise Thou canst, find out who is the wretched wight Thus at the mercy of his enemies.' Whereon my Guide drew full within his sight, Asking him whence he came, and he replied: 'In kingdom of Navarre[598] I first saw light. 

Me servant to a lord my mother tied; Through her I from a scoundrel sire did spring,                 50 Waster of goods and of himself beside.As servant next to Thiebault,[599] righteous king, I set myself to ply barratorship; And in this heat discharge my reckoning.' And Ciriatto, close upon whose lip On either side a boar-like tusk did stand, Made him to feel how one of them could rip. The mouse had stumbled on the wild cat band; But Barbariccia locked him in embrace, And, 'Off while I shall hug him!' gave command. 60 Round to my Master then he turned his face: 'Ask more of him if more thou wouldest know, While he against their fury yet finds grace.' My Leader asked: 'Declare now if below The pitch 'mong all the guilty there lies here A Latian? '[600] He replied: 'Short while ago From one[601] I parted who to them lived near; And would that I might use him still for shield, Then hook or claw I should no longer fear,' Said Libicocco: 'Too much grace we yield.' 70 And in the sinner's arm he fixed his hook, And from it clean a fleshy fragment peeled. 

But seeing Draghignazzo also took Aim at his legs, the leader of the Ten Turned swiftly round on them with angry look.On this they were a little quieted; then Of him who still gazed on his wound my Guide Without delay demanded thus again: 'Who was it whom, in coming to the side, Thou say'st thou didst do ill to leave behind?' 80 'Gomita of Gallura,'[602] he replied, 'A vessel full of fraud of every kind, Who, holding in his power his master's foes, So used them him they bear in thankful mind; For, taking bribes, he let slip all of those, He says; and he in other posts did worse, And as a chieftain 'mong barrators rose. Don Michael Zanche[603] doth with him converse, From Logodoro, and with endless din They gossip[604] of Sardinian characters. 90 But look, ah me! how yonder one doth grin. More would I say, but that I am afraid He is about to claw me on the skin.' To Farfarel the captain turned his head, For, as about to swoop, he rolled his eye, And, 'Cursed hawk, preserve thy distance!' said. 

'If ye would talk with, or would closer spy,' The frighted wretch began once more to say, 'Tuscans or Lombards, I will bring them nigh.But let the Malebranche first give way,                          100 That of their vengeance they may not have fear, And I to this same place where now I stay For me, who am but one, will bring seven near When I shall whistle as we use to do Whenever on the surface we appear.' On this Cagnazzo up his muzzle threw, Shaking his head and saying: 'Hear the cheat He has contrived, to throw himself below.' Then he who in devices was complete: 'Far too malicious, in good sooth,' replied,                   110 'When for my friends I plan a sorer fate.' This, Alichin withstood not but denied The others' counsel,[605] saying: 'If thou fling Thyself hence, thee I strive not to outstride. But o'er the pitch I'll dart upon the wing. Leave we the ridge,[606] and be the bank a shield; And see if thou canst all of us outspring.' O Reader, hear a novel trick revealed. All to the other side turned round their eyes, He first[607] who slowest was the boon to yield. 

120 In choice of time the Navarrese was wise; Taking firm stand, himself he forward flung, Eluding thus their hostile purposes.Then with compunction each of them was stung, But he the most[608] whose slackness made them fail; Therefore he started, 'Caught!' upon his tongue. But little it bested, nor could prevail His wings 'gainst fear. Below the other went, While he with upturned breast aloft did sail. And as the falcon, when, on its descent,                         130 The wild duck suddenly dives out of sight, Returns outwitted back, and malcontent; To be befooled filled Calcabrin with spite. Hovering he followed, wishing in his mind The wretch escaping should leave cause for fight. When the barrator vanished, from behind He on his comrade with his talons fell And clawed him, 'bove the moat with him entwined. The other was a spar-hawk terrible To claw in turn; together then the two                         140 Plunged in the boiling pool. The heat full well How to unlock their fierce embraces knew; But yet they had no power[609] to rise again, So were their wings all plastered o'er with glue. Then Barbariccia, mourning with his train, Caused four to fly forth to the other side With all their grapplers. Swift their flight was ta'en. 

Down to the place from either hand they glide, Reaching their hooks to those who were limed fast, And now beneath the scum were being fried.150 And from them thus engaged we onward passed.
