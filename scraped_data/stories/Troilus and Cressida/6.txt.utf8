<ACTION>Enter Thersites, alone.</ACTION> 

THERSITES  How now, Thersites? What, lost in the labyrinth of thy fury? Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He beats me, and I rail at him. O, worthy satisfaction! Would it were otherwise, that I could beat him whilst he railed at me. ’Sfoot, I’ll learn to	 conjure and raise devils but I’ll see some issue of my spiteful execrations. Then there’s Achilles, a rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,	 forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods; and, Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus, if you take not that little, little, less than little wit from them that they have, which short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant	 scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on the whole camp! Or rather, the Neapolitan bone-ache! For that, methinks, is the curse depending	 on those that war for a placket. I have said my prayers, and devil Envy say “Amen.”—What ho, my lord Achilles! 

PATROCLUS ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> Who’s there? Thersites? Good Thersites, come in and rail.	 

THERSITES If I could ’a remembered a gilt counterfeit, thou couldst not have slipped out of my contemplation. But it is no matter. Thyself upon thyself! The common curse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in great revenue! Heaven bless thee from	 a tutor, and discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy direction till thy death; then if she that lays thee out says thou art a fair corse, I’ll be sworn and sworn upon ’t she never shrouded any but lazars. Amen.	 

<ACTION>Enter Patroclus.</ACTION> 

Where’s Achilles? 

PATROCLUS What, art thou devout? Wast thou in prayer? 

THERSITES Ay. The heavens hear me! 

PATROCLUS Amen.	 

ACHILLES ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> Who’s there? 

PATROCLUS Thersites, my lord. 

ACHILLES ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> Where? Where? O, where? 

<ACTION>Enter Achilles.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>To Thersites.</ACTION> Art thou come? Why, my cheese, my digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to my	 table so many meals? Come, what’s Agamemnon? 

THERSITES  Thy commander, Achilles.—Then, tell me, Patroclus, what’s Achilles? 

PATROCLUS Thy lord, Thersites. Then, tell me, I pray thee, what’s Thersites?	 

THERSITES Thy knower, Patroclus. Then, tell me, Patroclus, what art thou? 

PATROCLUS Thou must tell that knowest. 

ACHILLES O tell, tell. 

THERSITES I’ll decline the whole question. Agamemnon	 commands Achilles, Achilles is my lord, I am Patroclus’ knower, and Patroclus is a fool. 

PATROCLUS You rascal! 

THERSITES Peace, fool. I have not done. 

ACHILLES ,  <ACTION>to Patroclus</ACTION> He is a privileged man.—Proceed,	 Thersites. 

THERSITES Agamemnon is a fool, Achilles is a fool, Thersites is a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool. 

ACHILLES Derive this. Come.	 

THERSITES Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles, Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon, Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool, and this Patroclus is a fool positive. 

PATROCLUS  Why am I a fool?	 

THERSITES Make that demand of the creator. It suffices me thou art. 

<ACTION>Enter at a distance Agamemnon, Ulysses, Nestor,Diomedes, Ajax, and Calchas.</ACTION> 

Look you, who comes here? 

ACHILLES Patroclus, I’ll speak with nobody.—Come in with me, Thersites.  75 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

THERSITES Here is such patchery, such juggling, and such knavery. All the argument is a whore and a cuckold, a good quarrel to draw emulous factions and bleed to death upon. Now the dry serpigo on the subject, and war and lechery confound all!	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

AGAMEMNON ,  <ACTION>to Patroclus</ACTION> Where is Achilles? 

PATROCLUS Within his tent, but ill-disposed, my lord. 

AGAMEMNON Let it be known to him that we are here. He shent our messengers, and we lay by Our appertainments, visiting of him.	 Let him be told so, lest perchance he think We dare not move the question of our place Or know not what we are. 

PATROCLUS I shall say so to him.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

ULYSSES We saw him at the opening of his tent.	 He is not sick. 

AJAX Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart. You may call it melancholy if you will favor the man, but, by my head, ’tis pride. But, why, why? Let him show us a cause.—A word, my lord.	 

<ACTION>He and Agamemnon walk aside.</ACTION> 

NESTOR What moves Ajax thus to bay at him? 

ULYSSES Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him. 

NESTOR Who, Thersites? 

ULYSSES He. 

NESTOR Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his	 argument. 

ULYSSES No. You see, he is his argument that has his argument: Achilles. 

NESTOR All the better. Their fraction is more our wish than their faction. But it was a strong composure a	 fool could disunite. 

ULYSSES The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easily untie. 

<ACTION>Enter Patroclus.</ACTION> 

Here comes Patroclus. 

NESTOR No Achilles with him.	 

ULYSSES The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy; his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure. 

PATROCLUS ,  <ACTION>to Agamemnon</ACTION> Achilles bids me say he is much sorry If anything more than your sport and pleasure Did move your greatness and this noble state	 To call upon him. He hopes it is no other But for your health and your digestion sake, An after-dinner’s breath. 

AGAMEMNON Hear you, Patroclus: We are too well acquainted with these answers,	 But his evasion, winged thus swift with scorn, Cannot outfly our apprehensions. Much attribute he hath, and much the reason Why we ascribe it to him. Yet all his virtues, Not virtuously on his own part beheld,	 Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss, Yea, and like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish, Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin If you do say we think him overproud	 And underhonest, in self-assumption greater Than in the note of judgment; and worthier than himself Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on, Disguise the holy strength of their command,	 And underwrite in an observing kind His humorous predominance—yea, watch His course and time, his ebbs and flows, as if The passage and whole carriage of this action Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add	 That, if he overhold his price so much, We’ll none of him. But let him, like an engine Not portable, lie under this report: “Bring action hither; this cannot go to war.” A stirring dwarf we do allowance give	 Before a sleeping giant. Tell him so. 

PATROCLUS I shall, and bring his answer presently. 

AGAMEMNON In second voice we’ll not be satisfied; We come to speak with him.—Ulysses, enter you. 

<ACTION>Ulysses exits, with Patroclus.</ACTION> 

AJAX What is he more than another?	 

AGAMEMNON No more than what he thinks he is. 

AJAX Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a better man than I am? 

AGAMEMNON No question. 

AJAX  Will you subscribe his thought and say he is?	 

AGAMEMNON  No, noble Ajax. You are as strong, as valiant, as wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether more tractable. 

AJAX  Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I know not what pride is.	 

AGAMEMNON Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the fairer. He that is proud eats up himself. Pride is his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle; and whatever praises itself but in the deed devours the deed in the praise.	 

AJAX I do hate a proud man as I hate the engendering of toads. 

NESTOR ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> And yet he loves himself. Is ’t not strange? 

<ACTION>Enter Ulysses.</ACTION> 

ULYSSES Achilles will not to the field tomorrow. 

AGAMEMNON What’s his excuse?	 

ULYSSES He doth rely on none, But carries on the stream of his dispose, Without observance or respect of any, In will peculiar and in self-admission. 

AGAMEMNON Why, will he not, upon our fair request,	 Untent his person and share th’ air with us? 

ULYSSES Things small as nothing, for request’s sake only, He makes important. Possessed he is with greatness And speaks not to himself but with a pride That quarrels at self-breath. Imagined worth	 Holds in his blood such swoll’n and hot discourse That ’twixt his mental and his active parts Kingdomed Achilles in commotion rages And batters down himself. What should I say? He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it	 Cry “No recovery.” 

AGAMEMNON Let Ajax go to him.— Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent. ’Tis said he holds you well and will be led At your request a little from himself.	 

ULYSSES O Agamemnon, let it not be so! We’ll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes When they go from Achilles. Shall the proud lord That bastes his arrogance with his own seam And never suffers matter of the world	 Enter his thoughts, save such as doth revolve And ruminate himself—shall he be worshipped Of that we hold an idol more than he? No. This thrice-worthy and right valiant lord Shall not so stale his palm, nobly acquired,	 Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit, As amply titled as Achilles is, By going to Achilles. That were to enlard his fat-already pride And add more coals to Cancer when he burns	 With entertaining great Hyperion. This lord go to him? Jupiter forbid And say in thunder “Achilles, go to him.” 

NESTOR , <ACTION> aside to Diomedes</ACTION> O, this is well; he rubs the vein of him. 

DIOMEDES ,  <ACTION>aside to Nestor</ACTION> And how his silence drinks up this applause!	 

AJAX If I go to him, with my armèd fist I’ll pash him o’er the face. 

AGAMEMNON O, no, you shall not go. 

AJAX An he be proud with me, I’ll feeze his pride. Let me go to him.	 

ULYSSES Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel. 

AJAX  A paltry, insolent fellow. 

NESTOR ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> How he describes himself! 

AJAX Can he not be sociable? 

ULYSSES ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> The raven chides blackness.	 

AJAX I’ll let his humorous blood. 

AGAMEMNON ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> He will be the physician that should be the patient. 

AJAX An all men were of my mind— 

ULYSSES ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Wit would be out of fashion.	225 

AJAX —he should not bear it so; he should eat swords first. Shall pride carry it? 

NESTOR ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> An ’twould, you’d carry half. 

ULYSSES ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> He would have ten shares. 

AJAX I will knead him; I’ll make him supple.	 

NESTOR ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> He’s not yet through warm. Force him with praises. Pour in, pour in; his ambition is dry. 

ULYSSES ,  <ACTION>to Agamemnon</ACTION> My lord, you feed too much on this dislike. 

NESTOR ,  <ACTION>to Agamemnon</ACTION> Our noble general, do not do so. 

DIOMEDES ,  <ACTION>to Agamemnon</ACTION> You must prepare to fight without Achilles.	235 

ULYSSES Why, ’tis this naming of him does him harm. Here is a man—but ’tis before his face; I will be silent. 

NESTOR Wherefore should you so? He is not emulous, as Achilles is.	 

ULYSSES Know the whole world, he is as valiant— 

AJAX A whoreson dog, that shall palter with us thus! Would he were a Trojan! 

NESTOR What a vice were it in Ajax now— 

ULYSSES If he were proud—	 

DIOMEDES Or covetous of praise— 

ULYSSES Ay, or surly borne— 

DIOMEDES Or strange, or self-affected— 

ULYSSES ,  <ACTION>to Ajax</ACTION> Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure.	 Praise him that gat thee, she that gave thee suck; Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature Thrice famed beyond, beyond thy erudition; But he that disciplined thine arms to fight, Let Mars divide eternity in twain	 And give him half; and for thy vigor, Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom, Which like a bourn, a pale, a shore confines Thy spacious and dilated parts. Here’s Nestor,	 Instructed by the antiquary times; He must, he is, he cannot but be wise.— But pardon, father Nestor, were your days As green as Ajax’ and your brain so tempered, You should not have the eminence of him, But be as Ajax. 

AJAX Shall I call you father? 

NESTOR Ay, my good son. 

DIOMEDES  Be ruled by him, Lord Ajax. 

ULYSSES There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles	 Keeps thicket. Please it our great general To call together all his state of war. Fresh kings are come to Troy. Tomorrow We must with all our main of power stand fast. And here’s a lord—come knights from east to west	 And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best. 

AGAMEMNON Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep. Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
