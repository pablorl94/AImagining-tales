<ACTION>Enter Imogen alone, dressed as a boy, Fidele.</ACTION> 

IMOGEN I see a man’s life is a tedious one. I have tired myself, and for two nights together Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick But that my resolution helps me. Milford, When from the mountain top Pisanio showed thee,	 Thou wast within a ken. O Jove, I think Foundations fly the wretched—such, I mean, Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told me I could not miss my way. Will poor folks lie, That have afflictions on them, knowing ’tis	 A punishment or trial? Yes. No wonder, When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fullness Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord, Thou art one o’ th’ false ones. Now I think on thee,	 My hunger’s gone; but even before, I was At point to sink for food. But what is this? Here is a path to ’t. ’Tis some savage hold. I were best not call; I dare not call. Yet famine, Ere clean it o’erthrow nature, makes it valiant. Plenty and peace breeds cowards; hardness ever Of hardiness is mother.—Ho! Who’s here? 

If anything that’s civil, speak; if savage, Take or lend.Ho!—No answer? Then I’ll enter. Best draw my sword; an if mine enemy	 But fear the sword like me, he’ll scarcely look on ’t. <ACTION>She draws her sword.</ACTION> Such a foe, good heavens! <ACTION>She exits, as into the cave.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Belarius as Morgan, Guiderius as Polydor, andArviragus as Cadwal.</ACTION> 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> You, Polydor, have proved best woodman and Are master of the feast. Cadwal and I Will play the cook and servant; ’tis our match.	 The sweat of industry would dry and die But for the end it works to. Come, our stomachs Will make what’s homely savory. Weariness Can snore upon the flint when resty sloth Finds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here,	 Poor house, that keep’st thyself. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> I am throughly weary. 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> There is cold meat i’ th’ cave. We’ll browse on that Whilst what we have killed be cooked.	 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan, looking into the cave</ACTION> Stay, come not in! But that it eats our victuals, I should think Here were a fairy. 

GUIDERIUS , <ACTION> as Polydor</ACTION> What’s the matter, sir?	 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> By Jupiter, an angel! Or, if not, An earthly paragon. Behold divineness No elder than a boy. 

<ACTION>Enter Imogen as Fidele.</ACTION> 

IMOGEN, <ACTION>as Fidele</ACTION> Good masters, harm me not. Before I entered here, I called, and thought	 To have begged or bought what I have took. Good troth, I have stol’n naught, nor would not, though I had found Gold strewed i’ th’ floor. Here’s money for my meat.	 She offers money. I would have left it on the board so soon As I had made my meal, and parted With prayers for the provider. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> Money, youth? 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> All gold and silver rather turn to dirt,	 As ’tis no better reckoned but of those Who worship dirty gods. 

IMOGEN , <ACTION> as Fidele</ACTION> I see you’re angry. Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should Have died had I not made it.	 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan </ACTION> Whither bound? 

IMOGEN ,  <ACTION>as Fidele</ACTION> To Milford Haven. 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> What’s your name? 

IMOGEN ,  <ACTION>as Fidele</ACTION> Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who Is bound for Italy. He embarked at Milford, To whom being going, almost spent with hunger, I am fall’n in this offense. 

BELARIUS , <ACTION> as Morgan</ACTION> Prithee, fair youth, Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds By this rude place we live in. Well encountered!	 ’Tis almost night; you shall have better cheer Ere you depart, and thanks to stay and eat it.— Boys, bid him welcome. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor </ACTION> Were you a woman, youth, I should woo hard but be your groom in honesty,	 Ay, bid for you as I do buy. 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> I’ll make ’t my comfort He is a man. I’ll love him as my brother.— And such a welcome as I’d give to him After long absence, such is yours. Most welcome.	 Be sprightly, for you fall ’mongst friends. 

IMOGEN , <ACTION> as Fidele</ACTION> ’Mongst friends? If brothers— <ACTION>(aside) </ACTION> Would it had been so, that they Had been my father’s sons! Then had my prize	 Been less, and so more equal ballasting To thee, Posthumus. 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> He wrings at some distress. 

GUIDERIUS , as Polydor Would I could free ’t! 

ARVIRAGUS , as Cadwal Or I, whate’er it be,	 What pain it cost, what danger. Gods! 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan </ACTION> Hark, boys. They talk aside. 

IMOGEN  Great men That had a court no bigger than this cave, That did attend themselves and had the virtue	 Which their own conscience sealed them, laying by That nothing-gift of differing multitudes, Could not outpeer these twain. Pardon me, gods! I’d change my sex to be companion with them, Since Leonatus false.	 

BELARIUS , <ACTION> as Morgan</ACTION> It shall be so. Boys, we’ll go dress our hunt.—Fair youth, come in. Discourse is heavy, fasting. When we have supped, We’ll mannerly demand thee of thy story So far as thou wilt speak it.	 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> Pray, draw near. 

ARVIRAGUS , <ACTION> as Cadwal</ACTION> The night to th’ owl and morn to th’ lark less welcome. 

IMOGEN , <ACTION> as Fidele</ACTION> Thanks, sir. 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> I pray, draw near.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
