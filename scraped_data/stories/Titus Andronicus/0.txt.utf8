<ACTION>Flourish. Enter the Tribunes (including MarcusAndronicus) and Senators aloft. And then enter, below,Saturninus and his followers at one door, andBassianus and his followers at another door, withother Romans, Drums, and Trumpets.</ACTION> 

SATURNINUS Noble patricians, patrons of my right, Defend the justice of my cause with arms. And countrymen, my loving followers, Plead my successive title with your swords. I am his firstborn son that was the last That wore the imperial diadem of Rome. Then let my father’s honors live in me, Nor wrong mine age with this indignity. 

BASSIANUS Romans, friends, followers, favorers of my right, If ever Bassianus, Caesar’s son,	 Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome, Keep, then, this passage to the Capitol, And suffer not dishonor to approach The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate, To justice, continence, and nobility;  But let desert in pure election shine, And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice. 

MARCUS ,  <ACTION>(aloft, stepping forward and holding up the crown)</ACTION> Princes that strive by factions and by friends Ambitiously for rule and empery, Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand	20 A special party, have by common voice, In election for the Roman empery, Chosen Andronicus, surnamèd Pius For many good and great deserts to Rome. A nobler man, a braver warrior,	25 Lives not this day within the city walls. He by the Senate is accited home From weary wars against the barbarous Goths, That with his sons, a terror to our foes, Hath yoked a nation strong, trained up in arms. 30 Ten years are spent since first he undertook This cause of Rome, and chastisèd with arms Our enemies’ pride. Five times he hath returned Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons In coffins from the field. 35 And now at last, laden with honor’s spoils, Returns the good Andronicus to Rome, Renownèd Titus flourishing in arms. 

Let us entreat, by honor of his name Whom worthily you would have now succeed,	40 And in the Capitol and Senate’s right, Whom you pretend to honor and adore, That you withdraw you and abate your strength, Dismiss your followers and, as suitors should, Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.45 

SATURNINUS How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts! 

BASSIANUS Marcus Andronicus, so I do affy In thy uprightness and integrity, And so I love and honor thee and thine, Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,	50 And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all, Gracious Lavinia, Rome’s rich ornament, That I will here dismiss my loving friends, And to my fortunes and the people’s favor Commit my cause in balance to be weighed.	55 

<ACTION>Bassianus’ Soldiers exit.</ACTION> 

SATURNINUS Friends that have been thus forward in my right, I thank you all and here dismiss you all, And to the love and favor of my country Commit myself, my person, and the cause. Saturninus’ Soldiers exit. Rome, be as just and gracious unto me	60 As I am confident and kind to thee. Open the gates and let me in. 

BASSIANUS Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor. 

<ACTION>Flourish. They exit to go up into the Senate House.The Tribunes and Senators exit from the upper stage.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter a Captain.</ACTION> 

CAPTAIN Romans, make way! The good Andronicus, Patron of virtue, Rome’s best champion,	65 Successful in the battles that he fights, With honor and with fortune is returned From where he circumscribèd with his sword And brought to yoke the enemies of Rome. 

<ACTION>Sound drums and trumpets, and then enter two of Titus’sons (Lucius and Mutius) and then two men bearing acoffin covered with black, then two other sons (Martiusand Quintus), then Titus Andronicus, and then Tamorathe Queen of Goths and her sons Alarbus, Chiron andDemetrius, with Aaron the Moor, and others as many ascan be, then set down the coffin, and Titus speaks.</ACTION> 

TITUS Hail Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!	70 Lo, as the bark that hath discharged his fraught Returns with precious lading to the bay From whence at first she weighed her anchorage, Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs, To resalute his country with his tears,	75 Tears of true joy for his return to Rome. Thou great defender of this Capitol, Stand gracious to the rites that we intend. Romans, of five-and-twenty valiant sons, Half of the number that King Priam had,	80 Behold the poor remains alive and dead. These that survive let Rome reward with love; These that I bring unto their latest home, With burial amongst their ancestors. Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.	85 Titus, unkind and careless of thine own, Why suffer’st thou thy sons unburied yet To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx? Make way to lay them by their brethren. 

<ACTION>They open the tomb.</ACTION> 

There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,	90 And sleep in peace, slain in your country’s wars. O sacred receptacle of my joys, Sweet cell of virtue and nobility, How many sons hast thou of mine in store That thou wilt never render to me more?	95 

LUCIUS Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths, That we may hew his limbs and on a pile, Ad manes fratrum, sacrifice his flesh Before this earthy prison of their bones, That so the shadows be not unappeased,	100 Nor we disturbed with prodigies on Earth. 

TITUS I give him you, the noblest that survives, The eldest son of this distressèd queen. 

TAMORA Stay, Roman brethren!—Gracious conqueror, Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,	105 A mother’s tears in passion for her son. And if thy sons were ever dear to thee, O think my son to be as dear to me. Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome To beautify thy triumphs and return	110 Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke, But must my sons be slaughtered in the streets For valiant doings in their country’s cause? O, if to fight for king and commonweal Were piety in thine, it is in these!The eldest son of this distressèd queen. 115 

<ACTION>She kneels.</ACTION> 

Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood. Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods? Draw near them then in being merciful. Sweet mercy is nobility’s true badge. Thrice-noble Titus, spare my first-born son.	120 

TITUS Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me. These are their brethren whom your Goths beheld Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain Religiously they ask a sacrifice. To this your son is marked, and die he must,	125 T’ appease their groaning shadows that are gone. 

LUCIUS Away with him, and make a fire straight, And with our swords upon a pile of wood Let’s hew his limbs till they be clean consumed. 

<ACTION>Exit Titus’ sons with Alarbus.</ACTION> 

TAMORA ,  <ACTION>rising and speaking aside to her sons</ACTION> O cruel, irreligious piety!	130 

CHIRON ,  <ACTION>aside to Tamora and Demetrius</ACTION> Was never Scythia half so barbarous! 

DEMETRIUS ,  <ACTION>aside to Tamora and Chiron</ACTION> Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome! Alarbus goes to rest and we survive To tremble under Titus’ threat’ning look. Then, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal	135 The selfsame gods that armed the Queen of Troy With opportunity of sharp revenge Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent May favor Tamora the Queen of Goths (When Goths were Goths, and Tamora was queen)	140 To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes. 

<ACTION>Enter the sons of Andronicus again with bloody swords.</ACTION> 

LUCIUS See, lord and father, how we have performed Our Roman rites. Alarbus’ limbs are lopped, And entrails feed the sacrificing fire, Whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky.	145 Remaineth naught but to inter our brethren, And with loud larums welcome them to Rome. 

TITUS Let it be so. And let Andronicus Make this his latest farewell to their souls. 

<ACTION>Sound trumpets, and lay the coffin in the tomb.</ACTION> 

In peace and honor rest you here, my sons,	150 Rome’s readiest champions, repose you here in rest, Secure from worldly chances and mishaps. Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells, Here grow no damnèd drugs; here are no storms, No noise, but silence and eternal sleep.	155 In peace and honor rest you here, my sons. 

LAVINIA In peace and honor live Lord Titus long; My noble lord and father, live in fame. 

<ACTION>She kneels.</ACTION> 

Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears I render for my brethren’s obsequies,	160 And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy Shed on this earth for thy return to Rome. O bless me here with thy victorious hand, Whose fortunes Rome’s best citizens applaud. 

TITUS Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved	 The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!— Lavinia, live, outlive thy father’s days And fame’s eternal date, for virtue’s praise. 

<ACTION>Lavinia rises.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Marcus Andronicus, carrying a white robe.Enter aloft Saturninus, Bassianus, Tribunes, Senators,and Guards.</ACTION> 

MARCUS Long live Lord Titus, my belovèd brother, Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome.	170 

TITUS Thanks, gentle tribune, noble brother Marcus. 

MARCUS And welcome, nephews, from successful wars— You that survive, and you that sleep in fame. Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all, That in your country’s service drew your swords;	 But safer triumph is this funeral pomp, That hath aspired to Solon’s happiness, And triumphs over chance in honor’s bed.— Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome, Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,	 Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust, This palliament of white and spotless hue, And name thee in election for the empire With these our late deceasèd emperor’s sons. Be candidatus, then, and put it on	 And help to set a head on headless Rome. 

TITUS A better head her glorious body fits Than his that shakes for age and feebleness. To Tribunes and Senators aloft. What, should I don this robe and trouble you?	 Be chosen with proclamations today, Tomorrow yield up rule, resign my life, And set abroad new business for you all? Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years, And led my country’s strength successfully,	 And buried one and twenty valiant sons, Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms, In right and service of their noble country. Give me a staff of honor for mine age, But not a scepter to control the world.	 Upright he held it, lords, that held it last. 

MARCUS Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery. 

SATURNINUS Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell? 

TITUS Patience, Prince Saturninus. 

SATURNINUS Romans, do me right.	 Patricians, draw your swords and sheathe them not Till Saturninus be Rome’s emperor.— Andronicus, would thou were shipped to hell Rather than rob me of the people’s hearts. 

LUCIUS Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good	 That noble-minded Titus means to thee. 

TITUS Content thee, prince. I will restore to thee The people’s hearts and wean them from themselves. 

BASSIANUS Andronicus, I do not flatter thee, But honor thee, and will do till I die.	 My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends, I will most thankful be, and thanks, to men Of noble minds, is honorable meed. 

TITUS People of Rome, and people’s tribunes here, I ask your voices and your suffrages.	 Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus? 

TRIBUNES To gratify the good Andronicus And gratulate his safe return to Rome, The people will accept whom he admits. 

TITUS Tribunes, I thank you, and this suit I make:	 That you create our emperor’s eldest son, Lord Saturnine, whose virtues will, I hope, Reflect on Rome as Titan’s rays on Earth And ripen justice in this commonweal. Then, if you will elect by my advice,	 Crown him and say “Long live our emperor.” 

MARCUS With voices and applause of every sort, Patricians and plebeians, we create Lord Saturninus Rome’s great emperor, And say “Long live our Emperor Saturnine.”	 

<ACTION>A long flourish till Saturninus, Bassianus,and Guards come down.</ACTION> 

SATURNINUS Titus Andronicus, for thy favors done To us in our election this day, I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts, And will with deeds requite thy gentleness. And for an onset, Titus, to advance	 Thy name and honorable family, Lavinia will I make my empress, Rome’s royal mistress, mistress of my heart, And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse. Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?	 

TITUS It doth, my worthy lord, and in this match I hold me highly honored of your Grace; And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine, King and commander of our commonweal, The wide world’s emperor, do I consecrate	 My sword, my chariot, and my prisoners, Presents well worthy Rome’s imperious lord. Receive them, then, the tribute that I owe, Mine honor’s ensigns humbled at thy feet. 

SATURNINUS Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life.	 How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts Rome shall record.—And when I do forget The least of these unspeakable deserts, Romans, forget your fealty to me. 

TITUS ,  <ACTION>to Tamora</ACTION> Now, madam, are you prisoner to an emperor,	 To him that for your honor and your state Will use you nobly, and your followers. 

SATURNINUS ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> A goodly lady, trust me, of the hue That I would choose, were I to choose anew.— Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance.	 Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer, Thou com’st not to be made a scorn in Rome. Princely shall be thy usage every way. Rest on my word, and let not discontent	 Daunt all your hopes. Madam, he comforts you Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.— Lavinia, you are not displeased with this? 

LAVINIA Not I, my lord, sith true nobility Warrants these words in princely courtesy.	 

SATURNINUS Thanks, sweet Lavinia.—Romans, let us go. Ransomless here we set our prisoners free. Proclaim our honors, lords, with trump and drum. 

<ACTION>Flourish. Saturninus and his Guards exit, with Drumsand Trumpets. Tribunes and Senators exit aloft.</ACTION> 

BASSIANUS Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine. 

TITUS How, sir? Are you in earnest then, my lord?	 

BASSIANUS Ay, noble Titus, and resolved withal To do myself this reason and this right. 

<ACTION>Bassianus takes Lavinia by the arm.</ACTION> 

MARCUS Suum cuique is our Roman justice. This prince in justice seizeth but his own. 

LUCIUS And that he will and shall, if Lucius live!	 

TITUS Traitors, avaunt! Where is the Emperor’s guard? 

<ACTION>Enter Saturninus and his Guards.</ACTION> 

Treason, my lord. Lavinia is surprised. 

SATURNINUS Surprised? By whom? 

BASSIANUS By him that justly may Bear his betrothed from all the world away.	 

MUTIUS Brothers, help to convey her hence away, And with my sword I’ll keep this door safe. 

<ACTION>Bassianus, Lavinia, Marcus, Lucius,Quintus, and Martius exit.</ACTION> 

TITUS ,  <ACTION>to Saturninus</ACTION> Follow, my lord, and I’ll soon bring her back. 

<ACTION>Saturninus, Tamora, Demetrius, Chiron,</ACTION> <ACTION>Aaron, and Guards exit.</ACTION> 

MUTIUS My lord, you pass not here. 

TITUS What, villain boy,	 Barr’st me my way in Rome? 

<ACTION>He stabs Mutius.</ACTION> 

MUTIUS Help, Lucius, help! 

<ACTION>Mutius dies.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Lucius.</ACTION> 

LUCIUS My lord, you are unjust, and more than so! In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son. 

TITUS Nor thou nor he are any sons of mine.	 My sons would never so dishonor me. Traitor, restore Lavinia to the Emperor. 

<ACTION>Enter aloft the Emperor Saturninus with Tamoraand her two sons and Aaron the Moor.</ACTION> 

LUCIUS Dead if you will, but not to be his wife That is another’s lawful promised love.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

SATURNINUS No, Titus, no, the Emperor needs her not,	 Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock. I’ll trust by leisure him that mocks me once, Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons, Confederates all thus to dishonor me. Was none in Rome to make a stale	 But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus, Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine That said’st I begged the empire at thy hands. 

TITUS O monstrous! What reproachful words are these? 

SATURNINUS But go thy ways. Go give that changing piece	 To him that flourished for her with his sword. A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy, One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons, To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome. 

TITUS These words are razors to my wounded heart.	 

SATURNINUS And therefore, lovely Tamora, Queen of Goths, That like the stately Phoebe ’mongst her nymphs Dost overshine the gallant’st dames of Rome, If thou be pleased with this my sudden choice, Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride,	 And will create thee Emperess of Rome. Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice? And here I swear by all the Roman gods, Sith priest and holy water are so near,	330 And tapers burn so bright, and everything In readiness for Hymenaeus stand, I will not resalute the streets of Rome Or climb my palace till from forth this place I lead espoused my bride along with me.	 

TAMORA And here in sight of heaven to Rome I swear, If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths, She will a handmaid be to his desires, A loving nurse, a mother to his youth. 

SATURNINUS Ascend, fair queen, to Pantheon.—Lords, accompany	 Your noble emperor and his lovely bride, Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine, Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquerèd. There shall we consummate our spousal rites. 

<ACTION>All but Titus exit.</ACTION> 

TITUS I am not bid to wait upon this bride.	 Titus, when wert thou wont to walk alone, Dishonored thus and challengèd of wrongs? 

<ACTION>Enter Marcus and Titus’ sons Lucius, Martius,and Quintus.</ACTION> 

MARCUS 

O Titus, see! O, see what thou hast done! In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son. 

TITUS 

No, foolish tribune, no; no son of mine,	 Nor thou, nor these confederates in the deed That hath dishonored all our family. Unworthy brother and unworthy sons! 

LUCIUS But let us give him burial as becomes, Give Mutius burial with our brethren.	 

TITUS Traitors, away! He rests not in this tomb. This monument five hundred years hath stood, Which I have sumptuously reedified. Here none but soldiers and Rome’s servitors Repose in fame, none basely slain in brawls.	 Bury him where you can. He comes not here. 

MARCUS My lord, this is impiety in you. My nephew Mutius’ deeds do plead for him. He must be buried with his brethren. 

MARTIUS And shall, or him we will accompany.	 

TITUS “And shall”? What villain was it spake that word? 

MARTIUS He that would vouch it in any place but here. 

TITUS What, would you bury him in my despite? 

MARCUS No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee To pardon Mutius and to bury him.	 

TITUS Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest, And with these boys mine honor thou hast wounded. My foes I do repute you every one. So trouble me no more, but get you gone. 

QUINTUS He is not with himself; let us withdraw.	 

MARTIUS Not I, till Mutius’ bones be burièd. 

<ACTION>The brother (Marcus) and the sons(Lucius, Martius, and Quintus) kneel.</ACTION> 

MARCUS Brother, for in that name doth nature plead— 

MARTIUS Father, and in that name doth nature speak— 

TITUS Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed. 

MARCUS Renownèd Titus, more than half my soul—	 

LUCIUS Dear father, soul and substance of us all— 

MARCUS Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter His noble nephew here in virtue’s nest, That died in honor and Lavinia’s cause. Thou art a Roman; be not barbarous.	 The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax, That slew himself, and wise Laertes’ son Did graciously plead for his funerals. Let not young Mutius, then, that was thy joy, Be barred his entrance here.	 

TITUS Rise, Marcus, rise. 

<ACTION>They rise.</ACTION> 

The dismall’st day is this that e’er I saw, To be dishonored by my sons in Rome. Well, bury him, and bury me the next. 

<ACTION>They put Mutius in the tomb.</ACTION> 

LUCIUS There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends’,	 Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb. They all except Titus kneel and say: No man shed tears for noble Mutius. He lives in fame, that died in virtue’s cause. 

<ACTION>All but Marcus and Titus exit.</ACTION> 

MARCUS My lord, to step out of these dreary dumps, How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths	 Is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome? 

TITUS I know not, Marcus, but I know it is. Whether by device or no, the heavens can tell. Is she not then beholding to the man That brought her for this high good turn so far?	 Yes, and will nobly him remunerate. 

<ACTION>Flourish. Enter the Emperor Saturninus, Tamoraand her two sons, with Aaron the Moor, Drums andTrumpets, at one door. Enter at the other doorBassianus and Lavinia, with Lucius, Martius, andQuintus, and others.</ACTION> 

SATURNINUS So, Bassianus, you have played your prize. God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride. 

BASSIANUS And you of yours, my lord. I say no more, Nor wish no less, and so I take my leave.	 

SATURNINUS Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power, Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape. 

BASSIANUS “Rape” call you it, my lord, to seize my own, My true betrothèd love and now my wife? But let the laws of Rome determine all.	 Meanwhile am I possessed of that is mine. 

SATURNINUS ’Tis good, sir, you are very short with us. But if we live, we’ll be as sharp with you. 

BASSIANUS My lord, what I have done, as best I may, Answer I must, and shall do with my life.	 Only thus much I give your Grace to know: By all the duties that I owe to Rome, This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here, Is in opinion and in honor wronged, That in the rescue of Lavinia	 With his own hand did slay his youngest son, In zeal to you, and highly moved to wrath To be controlled in that he frankly gave. Receive him then to favor, Saturnine, That hath expressed himself in all his deeds	 A father and a friend to thee and Rome. 

TITUS Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds. ’Tis thou, and those, that have dishonored me. Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge How I have loved and honored Saturnine.	 <ACTION>He kneels.</ACTION> 435 

TAMORA ,  <ACTION>to Saturninus</ACTION> My worthy lord, if ever Tamora Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine, Then hear me speak indifferently for all, And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past. 

SATURNINUS What, madam, be dishonored openly,	 And basely put it up without revenge? 

TAMORA Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forfend I should be author to dishonor you. But on mine honor dare I undertake For good Lord Titus’ innocence in all,	 Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs. Then at my suit look graciously on him. Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose, Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart. <ACTION>Aside to Saturninus. </ACTION> My lord, be ruled by me; be	 won at last.  Dissemble all your griefs and discontents. You are but newly planted in your throne. Lest, then, the people, and patricians too, Upon a just survey take Titus’ part	 And so supplant you for ingratitude, Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin. Yield at entreats, and then let me alone. I’ll find a day to massacre them all And raze their faction and their family,	 The cruel father and his traitorous sons, To whom I sued for my dear son’s life, And make them know what ’tis to let a queen Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain. Aloud. Come, come, sweet emperor.—Come,	 Andronicus.— Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart That dies in tempest of thy angry frown. 

SATURNINUS Rise, Titus, rise. My empress hath prevailed. 

TITUS ,  <ACTION>rising</ACTION> I thank your Majesty and her, my lord.	470 These words, these looks, infuse new life in me. 

TAMORA Titus, I am incorporate in Rome, A Roman now adopted happily, And must advise the Emperor for his good. This day all quarrels die, Andronicus.—	475 And let it be mine honor, good my lord, That I have reconciled your friends and you.— For you, Prince Bassianus, I have passed My word and promise to the Emperor That you will be more mild and tractable.—	480 And fear not, lords—and you, Lavinia. By my advice, all humbled on your knees, You shall ask pardon of his Majesty. 

<ACTION>Marcus, Lavinia, Lucius, Martius, and Quintus kneel.</ACTION> 

LUCIUS We do, and vow to heaven and to his Highness That what we did was mildly as we might,	485 Tend’ring our sister’s honor and our own. 

MARCUS That on mine honor here do I protest. 

SATURNINUS Away, and talk not; trouble us no more. 

TAMORA Nay, nay, sweet emperor, we must all be friends. The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace.	490 I will not be denied. Sweetheart, look back. 

SATURNINUS Marcus, for thy sake, and thy brother’s here, And at my lovely Tamora’s entreats, I do remit these young men’s heinous faults. Stand up.	 <ACTION>They rise. </ACTION> 495 Lavinia, though you left me like a churl, I found a friend, and sure as death I swore I would not part a bachelor from the priest. Come, if the Emperor’s court can feast two brides, You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.—	500 This day shall be a love-day, Tamora. 

TITUS Tomorrow, an it please your Majesty To hunt the panther and the hart with me, With horn and hound we’ll give your Grace bonjour. 

SATURNINUS Be it so, Titus, and gramercy too.
