<ACTION>Enter old Queen Margaret.</ACTION> 

QUEEN MARGARET So now prosperity begins to mellow And drop into the rotten mouth of death. Here in these confines slyly have I lurked To watch the waning of mine enemies. A dire induction am I witness to,	 And will to France, hoping the consequence Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical. Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret. Who comes here?	 <ACTION>She steps aside.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Duchess of York and Queen Elizabeth.</ACTION> 

QUEEN ELIZABETH Ah, my poor princes! Ah, my tender babes,	 My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets, If yet your gentle souls fly in the air And be not fixed in doom perpetual, Hover about me with your airy wings And hear your mother’s lamentation. 

QUEEN MARGARET ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Hover about her; say that right for right Hath dimmed your infant morn to agèd night. 

DUCHESS So many miseries have crazed my voice That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute. Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?	 

QUEEN MARGARET ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet; Edward for Edward pays a dying debt. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs And throw them in the entrails of the wolf? When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?	 

QUEEN MARGARET ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> When holy Harry died, and my sweet son. 

DUCHESS , <ACTION> to Queen Elizabeth</ACTION> Dead life, blind sight, poor mortal living ghost, Woe’s scene, world’s shame, grave’s due by life usurped, Brief abstract and record of tedious days,	 Rest thy unrest on England’s lawful earth, Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH ,  <ACTION>as they both sit down</ACTION> Ah, that thou wouldst as soon afford a grave As thou canst yield a melancholy seat, Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.	 Ah, who hath any cause to mourn but we? 

QUEEN MARGARET ,  <ACTION>coming forward</ACTION> If ancient sorrow be most reverend, Give mine the benefit of seigniory, And let my griefs frown on the upper hand. If sorrow can admit society,	 Tell over your woes again by viewing mine. I had an Edward till a Richard killed him; I had a husband till a Richard killed him. Thou hadst an Edward till a Richard killed him; Thou hadst a Richard till a Richard killed him.	 

DUCHESS I had a Richard too, and thou did’st kill him; I had a Rutland too; thou holp’st to kill him. 

QUEEN MARGARET Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard killed him. From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept A hellhound that doth hunt us all to death—	 That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes, To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood; That excellent grand tyrant of the Earth, That reigns in gallèd eyes of weeping souls; That foul defacer of God’s handiwork	 Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves. O upright, just, and true-disposing God, How do I thank thee that this carnal cur Preys on the issue of his mother’s body And makes her pew-fellow with others’ moan!	 

DUCHESS ,  <ACTION>standing</ACTION> O Harry’s wife, triumph not in my woes! God witness with me, I have wept for thine. 

QUEEN MARGARET Bear with me. I am hungry for revenge, And now I cloy me with beholding it. Thy Edward he is dead, that killed my Edward,	 Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward; Young York, he is but boot, because both they Matched not the high perfection of my loss. Thy Clarence he is dead that stabbed my Edward, And the beholders of this frantic play,	 Th’ adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey, Untimely smothered in their dusky graves. Richard yet lives, hell’s black intelligencer, Only reserved their factor to buy souls And send them thither. But at hand, at hand	 Ensues his piteous and unpitied end. Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray, To have him suddenly conveyed from hence. Cancel his bond of life, dear God I pray, That I may live and say “The dog is dead.”	 

QUEEN ELIZABETH ,  <ACTION>standing</ACTION> O, thou didst prophesy the time would come That I should wish for thee to help me curse That bottled spider, that foul bunch-backed toad! 

QUEEN MARGARET I called thee then “vain flourish of my fortune.” I called thee then poor shadow, “painted queen,”	 The presentation of but what I was, The flattering index of a direful pageant, One heaved a-high to be hurled down below, A mother only mocked with two fair babes, A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag	 To be the aim of every dangerous shot, A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble, A queen in jest, only to fill the scene. Where is thy husband now? Where be thy brothers? Where are thy two sons? Wherein dost thou joy? Who sues and kneels and says “God save the Queen?” Where be the bending peers that flattered thee? Where be the thronging troops that followed thee? Decline all this, and see what now thou art:	 For happy wife, a most distressèd widow; For joyful mother, one that wails the name; For one being sued to, one that humbly sues; For queen, a very caitiff crowned with care; For she that scorned at me, now scorned of me;	 For she being feared of all, now fearing one; For she commanding all, obeyed of none. 

Thus hath the course of justice whirled about And left thee but a very prey to time, Having no more but thought of what thou wast	 To torture thee the more, being what thou art.Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow? Now thy proud neck bears half my burdened yoke, From which even here I slip my weary head	 And leave the burden of it all on thee. Farewell, York’s wife, and queen of sad mischance. These English woes shall make me smile in France. 

<ACTION>She begins to exit.</ACTION> 

QUEEN ELIZABETH O, thou well-skilled in curses, stay awhile, And teach me how to curse mine enemies.	 

QUEEN MARGARET Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days; Compare dead happiness with living woe; Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were, And he that slew them fouler than he is. Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse.	 Revolving this will teach thee how to curse. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH My words are dull. O, quicken them with thine! 

QUEEN MARGARET Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine.  

<ACTION>Margaret exits.</ACTION> 

DUCHESS Why should calamity be full of words?	 

QUEEN ELIZABETH Windy attorneys to their clients’ woes, Airy succeeders of intestate joys, Poor breathing orators of miseries, Let them have scope; though what they will impart Help nothing else, yet do they ease the heart.	 

DUCHESS If so, then be not tongue-tied. Go with me, And in the breath of bitter words let’s smother My damnèd son that thy two sweet sons smothered. 

<ACTION>A trumpet sounds.</ACTION> 

The trumpet sounds. Be copious in exclaims. 

RICHARD Who intercepts me in my expedition?	 

DUCHESS O, she that might have intercepted thee, By strangling thee in her accursèd womb, From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH ,  <ACTION>to Richard</ACTION> Hid’st thou that forehead with a golden crown Where should be branded, if that right were right,	 The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers? Tell me, thou villain-slave, where are my children? 

DUCHESS ,  <ACTION>to Richard</ACTION> Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence, And little Ned Plantagenet his son?	 

QUEEN ELIZABETH ,  <ACTION>to Richard</ACTION> Where is the gentle Rivers, Vaughan, Grey? 

DUCHESS ,  <ACTION>to Richard</ACTION> Where is kind Hastings? 

RICHARD A flourish, trumpets! Strike alarum, drums! Let not the heavens hear these telltale women Rail on the Lord’s anointed. Strike, I say!	 

<ACTION>Flourish. Alarums.</ACTION> 

Either be patient and entreat me fair, Or with the clamorous report of war Thus will I drown your exclamations. 

DUCHESS  Art thou my son? 

RICHARD Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.	 

DUCHESS Then patiently hear my impatience. 

RICHARD Madam, I have a touch of your condition, That cannot brook the accent of reproof. 

DUCHESS O, let me speak! 

RICHARD   Do then, but I’ll not hear.	 

DUCHESS I will be mild and gentle in my words. 

RICHARD And brief, good mother, for I am in haste. 

DUCHESS Art thou so hasty? I have stayed for thee, God knows, in torment and in agony. 

RICHARD And came I not at last to comfort you?	 

DUCHESS No, by the Holy Rood, thou know’st it well. Thou cam’st on Earth to make the Earth my hell. A grievous burden was thy birth to me; Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy; Thy school days frightful, desp’rate, wild, and	 furious; Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous; Thy age confirmed, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody, More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred. What comfortable hour canst thou name, That ever graced me with thy company? 

RICHARD Faith, none but Humfrey Hower, that called your Grace To breakfast once, forth of my company. If I be so disgracious in your eye,	 Let me march on and not offend you, madam.— Strike up the drum. 

DUCHESS I prithee, hear me speak. 

RICHARD You speak too bitterly. 

DUCHESS  Hear me a word,	 For I shall never speak to thee again. 

RICHARD So. 

DUCHESS Either thou wilt die by God’s just ordinance Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror, Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish	 And nevermore behold thy face again. Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse, Which in the day of battle tire thee more Than all the complete armor that thou wear’st. My prayers on the adverse party fight, And there the little souls of Edward’s children Whisper the spirits of thine enemies And promise them success and victory. Bloody thou art; bloody will be thy end. Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.	 

<ACTION>She exits.</ACTION> 

QUEEN ELIZABETH Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse Abides in me. I say amen to her. 

RICHARD Stay, madam. I must talk a word with you. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH I have no more sons of the royal blood	 For thee to slaughter. For my daughters, Richard, They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens, And therefore level not to hit their lives. 

RICHARD You have a daughter called Elizabeth, Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.	 

QUEEN ELIZABETH And must she die for this? O, let her live, And I’ll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty, Slander myself as false to Edward’s bed, Throw over her the veil of infamy. So she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughter,	 I will confess she was not Edward’s daughter. 

RICHARD Wrong not her birth. She is a royal princess. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH To save her life, I’ll say she is not so. 

RICHARD Her life is safest only in her birth. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH And only in that safety died her brothers.	 

RICHARD Lo, at their birth good stars were opposite. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH No, to their lives ill friends were contrary. 

RICHARD All unavoided is the doom of destiny. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH True, when avoided grace makes destiny. My babes were destined to a fairer death	 If grace had blessed thee with a fairer life. 

RICHARD You speak as if that I had slain my cousins. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH Cousins, indeed, and by their uncle cozened Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life. Whose hand soever launched their tender hearts,	 Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction. No doubt the murd’rous knife was dull and blunt Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart, To revel in the entrails of my lambs. But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame, My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys Till that my nails were anchored in thine eyes, And I, in such a desp’rate bay of death, Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft, Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.	 

RICHARD Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise And dangerous success of bloody wars As I intend more good to you and yours Than ever you or yours by me were harmed! 

QUEEN ELIZABETH What good is covered with the face of heaven,	 To be discovered, that can do me good? 

RICHARD Th’ advancement of your children, gentle lady. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads. 

RICHARD Unto the dignity and height of fortune, The high imperial type of this Earth’s glory.	 

QUEEN ELIZABETH Flatter my sorrow with report of it. Tell me what state, what dignity, what honor, Canst thou demise to any child of mine? 

RICHARD Even all I have—ay, and myself and all— Will I withal endow a child of thine;	 So in the Lethe of thy angry soul Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs Which thou supposest I have done to thee. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH Be brief, lest that the process of thy kindness Last longer telling than thy kindness’ date. 

RICHARD Then know that from my soul I love thy daughter. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH My daughter’s mother thinks it with her soul. 

RICHARD  What do you think? 

QUEEN ELIZABETH That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul. So from thy soul’s love didst thou love her brothers,	 And from my heart’s love I do thank thee for it. 

RICHARD Be not so hasty to confound my meaning. I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter And do intend to make her Queen of England. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH Well then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?	 

RICHARD Even he that makes her queen. Who else should be? 

QUEEN ELIZABETH What, thou? 

RICHARD Even so. How think you of it? 

QUEEN ELIZABETH How canst thou woo her? 

RICHARD That would I learn of you,	 As one being best acquainted with her humor. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH  And wilt thou learn of me? 

RICHARD Madam, with all my heart. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers, A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave	 “Edward” and “York.” Then haply will she weep. Therefore present to her—as sometime Margaret Did to thy father, steeped in Rutland’s blood— A handkerchief, which say to her did drain The purple sap from her sweet brother’s body,	 And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal. If this inducement move her not to love, Send her a letter of thy noble deeds; Tell her thou mad’st away her uncle Clarence, Her uncle Rivers, ay, and for her sake Mad’st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne. 

RICHARD You mock me, madam. This is not the way To win your daughter. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH There is no other way, Unless thou couldst put on some other shape And not be Richard, that hath done all this. 

RICHARD Say that I did all this for love of her. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee, Having bought love with such a bloody spoil. 

RICHARD Look what is done cannot be now amended. Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes, Which after-hours gives leisure to repent. If I did take the kingdom from your sons, To make amends I’ll give it to your daughter. If I have killed the issue of your womb,	 To quicken your increase I will beget Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter. A grandam’s name is little less in love Than is the doting title of a mother. They are as children but one step below,	 Even of your metal, of your very blood, Of all one pain, save for a night of groans Endured of her for whom you bid like sorrow. Your children were vexation to your youth, But mine shall be a comfort to your age. The loss you have is but a son being king, And by that loss your daughter is made queen. I cannot make you what amends I would; Therefore accept such kindness as I can. Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul	 Leads discontented steps in foreign soil, This fair alliance quickly shall call home To high promotions and great dignity. The king that calls your beauteous daughter wife Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother. 

Again shall you be mother to a king, And all the ruins of distressful times Repaired with double riches of content.What, we have many goodly days to see! The liquid drops of tears that you have shed	 Shall come again, transformed to orient pearl, Advantaging their love with interest Of ten times double gain of happiness. Go then, my mother; to thy daughter go. Make bold her bashful years with your experience;	 Prepare her ears to hear a wooer’s tale; Put in her tender heart th’ aspiring flame Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the Princess With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys; And when this arm of mine hath chastisèd	 The petty rebel, dull-brained Buckingham, Bound with triumphant garlands will I come And lead thy daughter to a conqueror’s bed, To whom I will retail my conquest won, And she shall be sole victoress, Caesar’s Caesar. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH Shall I be tempted of the devil thus? 

RICHARD Ay, if the devil tempt you to do good. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH Shall I forget myself to be myself? 

RICHARD Ay, if your self’s remembrance wrong yourself. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH   Yet thou didst kill my children.	 

RICHARD But in your daughter’s womb I bury them, Where, in that nest of spicery, they will breed Selves of themselves, to your recomforture. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH Shall I go win my daughter to thy will? 

RICHARD And be a happy mother by the deed.	 

QUEEN ELIZABETH I go. Write to me very shortly, And you shall understand from me her mind. 

RICHARD Bear her my true love’s kiss; and so, farewell. 

<ACTION>Queen exits.</ACTION> 

Relenting fool and shallow, changing woman! 

<ACTION>Enter Ratcliffe.</ACTION> 

How now, what news?	 

RATCLIFFE Most mighty sovereign, on the western coast Rideth a puissant navy. To our shores Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends, Unarmed and unresolved to beat them back. ’Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;	 And there they hull, expecting but the aid Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore. 

RICHARD Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk— Ratcliffe thyself, or Catesby. Where is he?	 

CATESBY Here, my good lord. 

RICHARD  Catesby, fly to the Duke. 

CATESBY I will, my lord, with all convenient haste. 

RICHARD Ratcliffe, come hither. Post to Salisbury.When thou com’st thither—To Catesby. Dull,	 unmindful villain, Why stay’st thou here and go’st not to the Duke? 

CATESBY First, mighty liege, tell me your Highness’ pleasure, What from your Grace I shall deliver to him. 

RICHARD O true, good Catesby. Bid him levy straight	 The greatest strength and power that he can make And meet me suddenly at Salisbury. 

CATESBY I go.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

RATCLIFFE What, may it please you, shall I do at Salisbury? 

RICHARD Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?	 

RATCLIFFE Your Highness told me I should post before. 

RICHARD My mind is changed. 

<ACTION>Enter Lord Stanley.</ACTION> 

Stanley, what news with you? 

STANLEY None good, my liege, to please you with the hearing, Nor none so bad but well may be reported.	 

RICHARD Hoyday, a riddle! Neither good nor bad. What need’st thou run so many miles about When thou mayst tell thy tale the nearest way? Once more, what news? 

STANLEY  Richmond is on the seas <ACTION>.	</ACTION> 

RICHARD There let him sink, and be the seas on him! White-livered runagate, what doth he there? 

STANLEY I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess. 

RICHARD Well, as you guess? 

STANLEY Stirred up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Morton,	 He makes for England, here to claim the crown. 

RICHARD Is the chair empty? Is the sword unswayed? Is the King dead, the empire unpossessed? What heir of York is there alive but we? And who is England’s king but great York’s heir?	 Then tell me, what makes he upon the seas? 

STANLEY Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess. 

RICHARD Unless for that he comes to be your liege, You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes. Thou wilt revolt and fly to him, I fear.	 

STANLEY No, my good lord. Therefore mistrust me not. 

RICHARD Where is thy power, then, to beat him back? Where be thy tenants and thy followers? Are they not now upon the western shore, Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships?	 

STANLEY No, my good lord. My friends are in the north. 

RICHARD Cold friends to me. What do they in the north When they should serve their sovereign in the west? 

STANLEY They have not been commanded, mighty king. Pleaseth your Majesty to give me leave,	 I’ll muster up my friends and meet your Grace Where and what time your Majesty shall please. 

RICHARD Ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond, But I’ll not trust thee. 

STANLEY Most mighty sovereign,	 You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful. I never was nor never will be false. 

RICHARD Go then and muster men, but leave behind Your son George Stanley. Look your heart be firm, Or else his head’s assurance is but frail.	 

STANLEY So deal with him as I prove true to you.

RICHARD I cry thee mercy. There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.

FOURTH MESSENGER Sir Thomas Lovell and Lord Marquess Dorset, ’Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms. But this good comfort bring I to your Highness: The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest. Richmond, in Dorsetshire, sent out a boat Unto the shore to ask those on the banks If they were his assistants, yea, or no— Who answered him they came from Buckingham	 Upon his party. He, mistrusting them, Hoised sail and made his course again for Brittany. 

RICHARD March on, march on, since we are up in arms, If not to fight with foreign enemies, Yet to beat down these rebels here at home. 

<ACTION>Enter Catesby.</ACTION> 

CATESBY My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken. That is the best news. That the Earl of Richmond Is with a mighty power landed at Milford Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.
