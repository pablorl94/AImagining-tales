Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus discuss the fight with the Romans. They disagree about what they should do about it.

Always afraid he will be recognized by somebody from the court, Belarius wants to lie low.

But Guiderius and Arviragus think that's cowardly; they want to help Cymbeline's forces fight.

It's two against one. Since the boys insist on fighting, Belarius finally agrees. He figures he'll have changed in appearance enough, anyway.

The three men set off to fight for Britain.
