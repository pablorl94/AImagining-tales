In another room at the Palace, the old Duchess of York, (mother to King Edward IV, Richard of Gloucester, and George of Clarence) is spending quality time with Clarence's two kids, Margaret Plantagenet (not to be confused with Queen Margaret) and Edward Plantagenet (not to be confused King Edward or Prince Edward).

The kids open the scene by asking if their father is dead. Their grandma says no, but they wonder why she's crying and calling them orphans and basically talking about their dead dad.

The kids conclude that their father is dead, and that the blame for it belongs to their uncle, King Edward. The boy is certain of this because his Uncle Richard told him so.

Just as their grandma is pointing out that their Uncle Richard is not trustworthy, Queen Elizabeth comes in, looking a mess and grieving for the dead King Edward.

Then everyone has a round of mourning over all the dead men in the family: Elizabeth has lost a husband, the children have lost a father, and the Duchess has lost two sons.

Just then Dorset and Rivers (who came in with the queen) interrupt with more pressing matters. The dead are dead, and the living must be crowned. Rivers suggests that Queen Elizabeth should straightaway send for her young son, also named Edward, who's next in line for the throne.

Just then Richard enters with Buckingham; Stanley, Earl of Derby; Hastings; and Ratcliffe.

Richard receives a cool welcome from his mother, and he and his lackeys discuss the transport of the young Edward to the throne from his place in Ludlow.

Richard then dismisses the ladies to go think over who should bring the young king to the palace.

Once Richard and Buckingham have the room to themselves, Buckingham refers to some secret conference the two men had earlier. Buckingham agrees that regardless of who goes to fetch the young king, he and Richard should be there. Their presence will help their other plan, which is making sure that the queen's friends don't get close to the new king.

Richard praises Buckingham for being so loyal.
