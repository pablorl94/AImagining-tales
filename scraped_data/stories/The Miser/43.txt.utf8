SCENE VI.--HARPAGON, ANSELME, ÉLISE, MARIANNE, CLÉANTE, VALÈRE, FROSINE, THE POLICE OFFICER, MASTER JACQUES, LA FLÈCHE. 

CLE. Do not grieve for your money, father, and accuse any one. I have news of it, and I come here to tell you that if you consent to let me marry Marianne, your money will be given back to you. 

HAR. Where is it? 

CLE. Do not trouble yourself about that. It is in a safe place, and I answer for it; everything depends on your resolve. It is for you to decide, and you have the choice either of losing Marianne or your cash-box. 

HAR. Has nothing been taken out? 

CLE. Nothing at all. Is it your intention to agree to this marriage, and to join your consent to that of her mother, who leaves her at liberty to do as she likes? 

MAR. (_to_ CLÉANTE). But you do not know that this consent is no longer sufficient, and that heaven has given me back a brother (_showing_ VALÈRE), at the same time that it has given me back a father (_showing_ ANSELME); and you have now to obtain me from him. 

ANS. Heaven, my dear children, has not restored you to me that I might oppose your wishes. Mr. Harpagon, you must be aware that the choice of a young girl is more likely to fall upon the son than upon the father. Come, now, do not force people to say to you what is unnecessary, and consent, as I do, to this double marriage. 

HAR. In order for me to be well advised, I must see my casket. 

CLE. You shall see it safe and sound. 

HAR. I have no money to give my children in marriage. 

ANS. Never mind, I have some; do not let this trouble you. 

HAR. Do you take upon yourself to defray the expenses of these two weddings? 

ANS. Yes, I will take this responsibility upon myself. Are you satisfied? 

HAR. Yes, provided you order me a new suit of clothes for the wedding. 

ANS. Agreed! Let us go and enjoy the blessings this happy day brings us. 

OFF. Stop, Sirs, stop; softly, if you please. Who is to pay me for my writing? 

HAR. We have nothing to do with your writing. 

OFF. Indeed! and yet I do not pretend to have done it for nothing. 

HAR. (_showing_ MASTER JACQUES). There is a fellow you can hang in payment! 

JAC. Alas! what is one to do? I receive a good cudgelling for telling the truth, and now they would hang me for lying. 

ANS. Mr. Harpagon, you must forgive him this piece of imposture. 

HAR. You will pay the officer then? 

ANS. Let it be so. Let us go quickly, my children, to share our joy with your mother! 

HAR. And I to see my dear casket 

THE END
