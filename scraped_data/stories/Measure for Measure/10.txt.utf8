<ACTION>Enter Mariana, and Boy singing.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Song.</ACTION> 

Take, O take those lips away, That so sweetly were forsworn, And those eyes, the break of day, Lights that do mislead the morn. But my kisses bring again, bring again, Seals of love, but sealed in vain, sealed in vain. 

<ACTION>Enter Duke as a Friar.</ACTION> 

MARIANA , <ACTION> to Boy</ACTION> Break off thy song and haste thee quick away. Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice Hath often stilled my brawling discontent. 

<ACTION>Boy exits.</ACTION> 

I cry you mercy, sir, and well could wish	 You had not found me here so musical. Let me excuse me, and believe me so, My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe. 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> ’Tis good, though music oft hath such a charm To make bad good and good provoke to harm.	 I pray you tell me, hath anybody inquired for me here today? Much upon this time have I promised here to meet. 

MARIANA You have not been inquired after. I have sat here all day.	 

<ACTION>Enter Isabella.</ACTION> 

DUKE ,  <ACTION>as Friar</ACTION> I do constantly believe you. The time is come even now. I shall crave your forbearance a little. Maybe I will call upon you anon for some advantage to yourself. 

MARIANA I am always bound to you.	 

<ACTION>She exits.</ACTION> 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> Very well met, and welcome. What is the news from this good deputy? 

ISABELLA He hath a garden circummured with brick, Whose western side is with a vineyard backed; And to that vineyard is a planchèd gate	 That makes his opening with this bigger key. This other doth command a little door Which from the vineyard to the garden leads. There have I made my promise, upon the Heavy middle of the night, to call upon him.	 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> But shall you on your knowledge find this way? 

ISABELLA I have ta’en a due and wary note upon ’t. With whispering and most guilty diligence, In action all of precept, he did show me The way twice o’er.	 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> Are there no other tokens Between you ’greed concerning her observance? 

ISABELLA No, none, but only a repair i’ th’ dark, And that I have possessed him my most stay Can be but brief, for I have made him know	 I have a servant comes with me along That stays upon me, whose persuasion is I come about my brother. 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> ’Tis well borne up. I have not yet made known to Mariana	 A word of this.—What ho, within; come forth. 

<ACTION>Enter Mariana.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>To Mariana.</ACTION> I pray you be acquainted with this maid. She comes to do you good. 

ISABELLA I do desire the like.	 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar, to Mariana</ACTION> Do you persuade yourself that I respect you? 

MARIANA Good friar, I know you do, and have found it. 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> Take then this your companion by the hand, Who hath a story ready for your ear. I shall attend your leisure. But make haste.	 The vaporous night approaches. 

MARIANA , <ACTION> to Isabella</ACTION> Will ’t please you walk aside? 

<ACTION>Isabella and Mariana exit.</ACTION> 

DUKE O place and greatness, millions of false eyes Are stuck upon thee; volumes of report Run with these false, and, most contrarious, quest	 Upon thy doings; thousand escapes of wit Make thee the father of their idle dream And rack thee in their fancies. 

<ACTION>Enter Mariana and Isabella.</ACTION> 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> Welcome. How agreed? 

ISABELLA She’ll take the enterprise upon her, father,	 If you advise it. 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar </ACTION> It is not my consent But my entreaty too. 

ISABELLA , <ACTION> to Mariana</ACTION> Little have you to say When you depart from him, but, soft and low,	 “Remember now my brother.” 

MARIANA Fear me not. 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all. He is your husband on a precontract. To bring you thus together ’tis no sin,	 Sith that the justice of your title to him Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go. Our corn’s to reap, for yet our tithe’s to sow. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
