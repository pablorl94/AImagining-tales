KENT Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you no reason? 

GENTLEMAN Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his coming forth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger	 that his personal return was most required and necessary. 

KENT Who hath he left behind him general? 

GENTLEMAN The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far. 

KENT  Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration	 of grief? 

GENTLEMAN Ay, sir, she took them, read them in my presence, And now and then an ample tear trilled down Her delicate cheek. It seemed she was a queen	 Over her passion, who, most rebel-like, Fought to be king o’er her. 

KENT O, then it moved her. 

GENTLEMAN Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove Who should express her goodliest. You have seen	 Sunshine and rain at once; her smiles and tears Were like a better way. Those happy smilets That played on her ripe lip seemed not to know What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence As pearls from diamonds dropped. In brief,	 Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved If all could so become it. 

KENT Made she no verbal question? 

GENTLEMAN Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of “father”	 Pantingly forth, as if it pressed her heart; Cried “Sisters, sisters, shame of ladies, sisters! Kent, father, sisters! What, i’ th’ storm, i’ th’ night? Let pity not be believed!” There she shook The holy water from her heavenly eyes,	 And clamor moistened. Then away she started, To deal with grief alone. 

KENT  It is the stars. The stars above us govern our conditions, Else one self mate and make could not beget	 Such different issues. You spoke not with her since? 

GENTLEMAN No. 

KENT Was this before the King returned? 

GENTLEMAN No, since.	 

KENT Well, sir, the poor distressèd Lear’s i’ th’ town, Who sometime in his better tune remembers What we are come about, and by no means Will yield to see his daughter. 

GENTLEMAN  Why, good sir?	 

KENT A sovereign shame so elbows him—his own unkindness, That stripped her from his benediction, turned her To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights To his dog-hearted daughters—these things sting	 His mind so venomously that burning shame Detains him from Cordelia. 

GENTLEMAN  Alack, poor gentleman! 

KENT Of Albany’s and Cornwall’s powers you heard not? 

GENTLEMAN ’Tis so. They are afoot.	 

KENT Well, sir, I’ll bring you to our master Lear And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause Will in concealment wrap me up awhile. When I am known aright, you shall not grieve Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go	 Along with me.
