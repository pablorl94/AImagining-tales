<ACTION>Here an alarum again, and Talbot pursueth theDauphin and driveth him; then enter Joan la Pucelle,driving Englishmen before her. They cross the stageand exit. Then enter Talbot.</ACTION> 

TALBOT Where is my strength, my valor, and my force? Our English troops retire; I cannot stay them. A woman clad in armor chaseth them. 

<ACTION>Enter Pucelle, with Soldiers.</ACTION> 

Here, here she comes!—I’ll have a bout with thee. Devil or devil’s dam, I’ll conjure thee.	 Blood will I draw on thee—thou art a witch— And straightway give thy soul to him thou serv’st. 

PUCELLE Come, come; ’tis only I that must disgrace thee. 

<ACTION>Here they fight.</ACTION> 

TALBOT Heavens, can you suffer hell so to prevail? My breast I’ll burst with straining of my courage,	 And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder, But I will chastise this high-minded strumpet. 

<ACTION>They fight again.</ACTION> 

PUCELLE Talbot, farewell. Thy hour is not yet come. I must go victual Orleance forthwith. 

<ACTION>A short alarum. Then she prepares toenter the town with Soldiers.</ACTION> 

O’ertake me if thou canst. I scorn thy strength.	 Go, go, cheer up thy hunger-starvèd men. Help Salisbury to make his testament. This day is ours, as many more shall be. 

<ACTION>She exits with Soldiers.</ACTION> 

TALBOT My thoughts are whirlèd like a potter’s wheel. I know not where I am nor what I do.	 A witch by fear—not force, like Hannibal— Drives back our troops, and conquers as she lists. So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench Are from their hives and houses driven away. They called us, for our fierceness, English dogs;	 Now like to whelps we crying run away. 

<ACTION>A short alarum. Enter English soldiers,chased by French soldiers.</ACTION> 

Hark, countrymen, either renew the fight, Or tear the lions out of England’s coat. Renounce your soil; give sheep in lions’ stead. Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf,	 Or horse or oxen from the leopard, As you fly from your oft-subduèd slaves. 

<ACTION>Alarum. Here another skirmish.</ACTION> 

It will not be! Retire into your trenches. You all consented unto Salisbury’s death, For none would strike a stroke in his revenge. Pucelle is entered into Orleance In spite of us or aught that we could do. 

<ACTION>Soldiers exit.</ACTION> 

O, would I were to die with Salisbury! The shame hereof will make me hide my head. 

<ACTION>Talbot exits. Alarum. Retreat.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Flourish. Enter on the walls Pucelle, Charles theDauphin, Reignier, Alanson, and Soldiers.</ACTION> 

PUCELLE Advance our waving colors on the walls. Rescued is Orleance from the English. Thus Joan la Pucelle hath performed her word. 

<ACTION>She exits.</ACTION> 

CHARLES Divinest creature, Astraea’s daughter, How shall I honor thee for this success? Thy promises are like Adonis’ garden That one day bloomed and fruitful were the next. France, triumph in thy glorious prophetess. Recovered is the town of Orleance. More blessèd hap did ne’er befall our state.	 

REIGNIER Why ring not bells aloud throughout the town? Dauphin, command the citizens make bonfires And feast and banquet in the open streets To celebrate the joy that God hath given us. 

ALANSON All France will be replete with mirth and joy	 When they shall hear how we have played the men. 

CHARLES ’Tis Joan, not we, by whom the day is won; For which I will divide my crown with her, And all the priests and friars in my realm Shall in procession sing her endless praise. A statelier pyramis to her I’ll rear Than Rhodophe’s of Memphis ever was. In memory of her, when she is dead, Her ashes, in an urn more precious Than the rich-jeweled coffer of Darius,	 Transported shall be at high festivals Before the kings and queens of France. No longer on Saint Dennis will we cry, But Joan la Pucelle shall be France’s saint. Come in, and let us banquet royally	 After this golden day of victory. 

<ACTION>Flourish. They exit.</ACTION>
