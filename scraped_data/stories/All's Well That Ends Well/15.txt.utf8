<ACTION>Enter one of the French Lords, with five or six otherSoldiers in ambush.</ACTION> 

LORD He can come no other way but by this hedge corner. When you sally upon him, speak what terrible language you will. Though you understand it not yourselves, no matter. For we must not seem to understand him, unless some one among us whom	 we must produce for an interpreter. 

FIRST SOLDIER Good captain, let me be th’ interpreter. 

LORD  Art not acquainted with him? Knows he not thy voice? 

FIRST SOLDIER No, sir, I warrant you.	 

LORD But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again? 

FIRST SOLDIER E’en such as you speak to me. 

LORD He must think us some band of strangers i’ th’ adversary’s entertainment. Now, he hath a smack	 of all neighboring languages. Therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we speak one to another. So we seem to know is to know straight our purpose: choughs’ language, gabble enough and good enough. As for	 you, interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch, ho! Here he comes to beguile two hours in a sleep and then to return and swear the lies he forges.	 

<ACTION>They move aside.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Parolles.</ACTION> 

PAROLLES Ten o’clock. Within these three hours ’twill	 be time enough to go home. What shall I say I have done? It must be a very plausive invention that carries it. They begin to smoke me, and disgraces have of late knocked too often at my door. I find my tongue is too foolhardy, but my heart hath the	 fear of Mars before it, and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my tongue. 

LORD ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> This is the first truth that e’er thine own tongue was guilty of. 

PAROLLES What the devil should move me to undertake	 the recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the impossibility and knowing I had no such purpose? I must give myself some hurts and say I got them in exploit. Yet slight ones will not carry it. They will say “Came you off with so little?” And	 great ones I dare not give. Wherefore? What’s the instance? Tongue, I must put you into a butter-woman’s mouth and buy myself another of Bajazeth’s mule if you prattle me into these perils. 

LORD , <ACTION> aside</ACTION> Is it possible he should know what he is,	 and be that he is? 

PAROLLES I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword. 

LORD , <ACTION> aside</ACTION> We cannot afford you so.	 

PAROLLES  Or the baring of my beard, and to say it was in stratagem. 

LORD , <ACTION> aside</ACTION> ’Twould not do. 

PAROLLES Or to drown my clothes and say I was stripped.	 

LORD ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Hardly serve. 

PAROLLES Though I swore I leapt from the window of the citadel— 

LORD , <ACTION> aside</ACTION> How deep? 

PAROLLES Thirty fathom.	 

LORD ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed. 

PAROLLES I would I had any drum of the enemy’s. I would swear I recovered it. 

LORD ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> You shall hear one anon.	 

PAROLLES A drum, now, of the enemy’s— 

<ACTION>Alarum within.</ACTION> 

LORD ,  <ACTION>advancing </ACTION> Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo. 

ALL Cargo, cargo, cargo, villianda par corbo, cargo. 

<ACTION>They seize him.</ACTION> 

PAROLLES O ransom, ransom! Do not hide mine eyes.	 

<ACTION>They blindfold him.</ACTION> 

FIRST SOLDIER Boskos thromuldo boskos. 

PAROLLES I know you are the Muskos’ regiment, And I shall lose my life for want of language. If there be here German or Dane, Low Dutch, Italian, or French, let him speak to me.	 I’ll discover that which shall undo the Florentine. 

FIRST SOLDIER Boskos vauvado, I understand thee and can speak thy tongue. Kerelybonto, sir, betake thee to thy faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.	 

PAROLLES O! 

FIRST SOLDIER O, pray, pray, pray! Manka reuania dulche. 

LORD  Oscorbidulchos voliuorco. 

FIRST SOLDIER The General is content to spare thee yet	 And, hoodwinked as thou art, will lead thee on To gather from thee. Haply thou mayst inform Something to save thy life. 

PAROLLES O, let me live, And all the secrets of our camp I’ll show,	 Their force, their purposes. Nay, I’ll speak that Which you will wonder at. 

FIRST SOLDIER But wilt thou faithfully? 

PAROLLES If I do not, damn me. 

FIRST SOLDIER Acordo linta. Come on, thou art	 granted space. 

<ACTION>He exits with Parolles under guard.A short alarum within.</ACTION> 

LORD Go tell the Count Rossillion and my brother We have caught the woodcock and will keep him muffled Till we do hear from them.	 

SECOND SOLDIER Captain, I will. 

LORD He will betray us all unto ourselves. Inform on that. 

SECOND SOLDIER So I will, sir. 

LORD Till then I’ll keep him dark and safely locked.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
