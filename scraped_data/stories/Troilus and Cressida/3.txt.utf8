<ACTION>Sennet. Enter Agamemnon, Nestor, Ulysses, Diomedes,Menelaus, with others.</ACTION> 

AGAMEMNON Princes, what grief hath set the jaundice o’er your cheeks? The ample proposition that hope makes In all designs begun on Earth below Fails in the promised largeness. Checks and disasters	 Grow in the veins of actions highest reared, As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap, Infects the sound pine and diverts his grain Tortive and errant from his course of growth. Nor, princes, is it matter new to us	 That we come short of our suppose so far That after seven years’ siege yet Troy walls stand, Sith every action that hath gone before, Whereof we have record, trial did draw Bias and thwart, not answering the aim	 And that unbodied figure of the thought That gave ’t surmisèd shape. Why then, you princes, Do you with cheeks abashed behold our works And call them shames, which are indeed naught else But the protractive trials of great Jove	 To find persistive constancy in men? The fineness of which metal is not found In Fortune’s love; for then the bold and coward, The wise and fool, the artist and unread, The hard and soft seem all affined and kin. 

But in the wind and tempest of her frown, Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan, Puffing at all, winnows the light away, And what hath mass or matter by itself Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.

NESTOR With due observance of thy godlike seat, Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance Lies the true proof of men. The sea being smooth, How many shallow bauble boats dare sail	 Upon her patient breast, making their way With those of nobler bulk! But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage The gentle Thetis, and anon behold The strong-ribbed bark through liquid mountains cut,	 Bounding between the two moist elements, Like Perseus’ horse. Where’s then the saucy boat Whose weak untimbered sides but even now Corrivaled greatness? Either to harbor fled Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so	 Doth valor’s show and valor’s worth divide In storms of Fortune. For in her ray and brightness The herd hath more annoyance by the breese Than by the tiger, but when the splitting wind Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,	 And flies flee under shade, why, then the thing of courage, As roused with rage, with rage doth sympathize, And with an accent tuned in selfsame key Retorts to chiding Fortune.	 

ULYSSES They tax our policy and call it cowardice, Count wisdom as no member of the war, Forestall prescience, and esteem no act But that of hand. The still and mental parts That do contrive how many hands shall strike	 When fitness calls them on and know by measure Of their observant toil the enemy’s weight— Why, this hath not a fingers dignity. They call this bed-work, mapp’ry, closet war; So that the ram that batters down the wall,	 For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise, They place before his hand that made the engine Or those that with the fineness of their souls By reason guide his execution. 

NESTOR Let this be granted, and Achilles’ horse	 Makes many Thetis’ sons.	 

<ACTION>Tucket.</ACTION> 

AGAMEMNON  What trumpet? Look, Menelaus. 

MENELAUS From Troy. 

<ACTION>Enter Aeneas, with a Trumpeter.</ACTION> 

AGAMEMNON What would you ’fore our tent? 

AENEAS Is this great Agamemnon’s tent, I pray you?	 

AGAMEMNON  Even this. 

AENEAS May one that is a herald and a prince Do a fair message to his kingly eyes? 

AGAMEMNON With surety stronger than Achilles’ arm ’Fore all the Greekish host, which with one voice	 Call Agamemnon head and general. 

AENEAS Fair leave and large security. How may A stranger to those most imperial looks Know them from eyes of other mortals? 

AGAMEMNON How?	 

AENEAS Ay. I ask that I might waken reverence And bid the cheek be ready with a blush Modest as morning when she coldly eyes The youthful Phoebus. Which is that god in office, guiding men?	 Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon? 

AGAMEMNON This Trojan scorns us, or the men of Troy Are ceremonious courtiers. 

AENEAS Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarmed, As bending angels—that’s their fame in peace.	 But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls, Good arms, strong joints, true swords, and—great Jove’s accord— Nothing so full of heart. But peace, Aeneas. Peace, Trojan. Lay thy finger on thy lips.	 The worthiness of praise distains his worth If that the praised himself bring the praise forth. But what the repining enemy commends, That breath fame blows; that praise, sole pure, transcends.	 

AGAMEMNON Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself Aeneas? 

AENEAS Ay, Greek, that is my name. 

AGAMEMNON  What’s your affair, I pray you? 

AENEAS Sir, pardon. ’Tis for Agamemnon’s ears. 

AGAMEMNON He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.	 

AENEAS Nor I from Troy come not to whisper with him. I bring a trumpet to awake his ear, To set his sense on the attentive bent, And then to speak. 

AGAMEMNON  Speak frankly as the wind;	 It is not Agamemnon’s sleeping hour. That thou shalt know, Trojan, he is awake, He tells thee so himself. 

AENEAS Trumpet, blow loud! Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;	 And every Greek of mettle, let him know What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud. 

<ACTION>Sound trumpet.</ACTION> 

We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy A prince called Hector—Priam is his father— Who in this dull and long-continued truce	 Is resty grown. He bade me take a trumpet And to this purpose speak: “Kings, princes, lords, If there be one among the fair’st of Greece That holds his honor higher than his ease, That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,	 That knows his valor and knows not his fear, That loves his mistress more than in confession With truant vows to her own lips he loves And dare avow her beauty and her worth In other arms than hers—to him this challenge.	 Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks, Shall make it good, or do his best to do it, He hath a lady wiser, fairer, truer Than ever Greek did couple in his arms And will tomorrow with his trumpet call,	 Midway between your tents and walls of Troy, To rouse a Grecian that is true in love. If any come, Hector shall honor him; If none, he’ll say in Troy when he retires The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth	 The splinter of a lance.” Even so much. 

AGAMEMNON This shall be told our lovers, Lord Aeneas. If none of them have soul in such a kind, We left them all at home. But we are soldiers, And may that soldier a mere recreant prove	 That means not, hath not, or is not in love! If then one is, or hath, or means to be, That one meets Hector. If none else, I am he. 

NESTOR ,  <ACTION>to Aeneas</ACTION> Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man When Hector’s grandsire sucked. He is old now,	 But if there be not in our Grecian host A noble man that hath one spark of fire To answer for his love, tell him from me I’ll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver And in my vambrace put my withered brawns	 And, meeting him, will tell him that my lady Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste As may be in the world. His youth in flood, I’ll prove this troth with my three drops of blood. 

AENEAS Now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth!	 

ULYSSES Amen. 

AGAMEMNON Fair Lord Aeneas, let me touch your hand. To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir. Achilles shall have word of this intent; So shall each lord of Greece from tent to tent. Yourself shall feast with us before you go, And find the welcome of a noble foe. 

<ACTION>All but Ulysses and Nestor exit.</ACTION> 

ULYSSES  Nestor. 

NESTOR What says Ulysses? 

ULYSSES I have a young conception in my brain;	 Be you my time to bring it to some shape. 

NESTOR What is ’t? 

ULYSSES This ’tis: Blunt wedges rive hard knots; the seeded pride That hath to this maturity blown up	 In rank Achilles must or now be cropped Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil To overbulk us all. 

NESTOR Well, and how? 

ULYSSES This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,	 However it is spread in general name, Relates in purpose only to Achilles. 

NESTOR True. The purpose is perspicuous as substance Whose grossness little characters sum up; And, in the publication, make no strain	 But that Achilles, were his brain as barren As banks of Libya—though, Apollo knows, ’Tis dry enough—will, with great speed of judgment, Ay, with celerity, find Hector’s purpose Pointing on him.	 

ULYSSES And wake him to the answer, think you? 

NESTOR Why, ’tis most meet. Who may you else oppose That can from Hector bring his honor off If not Achilles? Though ’t be a sportful combat, Yet in the trial much opinion dwells,	 For here the Trojans taste our dear’st repute With their fin’st palate. And, trust to me, Ulysses, Our imputation shall be oddly poised In this vile action. For the success, Although particular, shall give a scantling	 Of good or bad unto the general; And in such indexes, although small pricks To their subsequent volumes, there is seen The baby figure of the giant mass Of things to come at large. It is supposed	 He that meets Hector issues from our choice; And choice, being mutual act of all our souls, Makes merit her election and doth boil, As ’twere from forth us all, a man distilled Out of our virtues, who, miscarrying,	 What heart receives from hence a conquering part To steel a strong opinion to themselves?— Which entertained, limbs are his instruments, In no less working than are swords and bows Directive by the limbs.	 

ULYSSES Give pardon to my speech: therefore ’tis meet Achilles meet not Hector. Let us like merchants First show foul wares and think perchance they’ll sell; If not, the luster of the better shall exceed By showing the worse first. Do not consent	 That ever Hector and Achilles meet, For both our honor and our shame in this Are dogged with two strange followers. 

NESTOR I see them not with my old eyes. What are they? 

ULYSSES What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,	 Were he not proud, we all should share with him; But he already is too insolent, And it were better parch in Afric sun Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes Should he scape Hector fair. If he were foiled,	 Why then we do our main opinion crush In taint of our best man. No, make a lott’ry, And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw The sort to fight with Hector. Among ourselves Give him allowance for the better man,	 For that will physic the great Myrmidon, Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends. If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off, We’ll dress him up in voices; if he fail,	 Yet go we under our opinion still That we have better men. But, hit or miss, Our project’s life this shape of sense assumes: Ajax employed plucks down Achilles’ plumes. 

NESTOR Now, Ulysses, I begin to relish thy advice,	 And I will give a taste thereof forthwith To Agamemnon. Go we to him straight. Two curs shall tame each other; pride alone Must tar the mastiffs on, as ’twere a bone.
