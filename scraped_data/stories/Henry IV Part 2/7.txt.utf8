FRANCIS What the devil hast thou brought there— applejohns? Thou knowest Sir John cannot endure an applejohn. 

SECOND DRAWER Mass, thou sayst true. The Prince once set a dish of applejohns before him and told	 him there were five more Sir Johns and, putting off his hat, said “I will now take my leave of these six dry, round, old, withered knights.” It angered him to the heart. But he hath forgot that. 

FRANCIS  Why then, cover and set them down, and see if	 thou canst find out Sneak’s noise. Mistress Tearsheet would fain hear some music. Dispatch. The room where they supped is too hot. They’ll come in straight. 

<ACTION>Enter Will.</ACTION> 

WILL Sirrah, here will be the Prince and Master	 Poins anon, and they will put on two of our jerkins and aprons, and Sir John must not know of it. Bardolph hath brought word. 

SECOND DRAWER By the Mass, here will be old utis. It will be an excellent stratagem.	 

FRANCIS I’ll see if I can find out Sneak. 

<ACTION>He exits with the Second Drawer.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Hostess and Doll Tearsheet.</ACTION> 

HOSTESS I’ faith, sweetheart, methinks now you are in an excellent good temperality. Your pulsidge beats as extraordinarily as heart would desire, and your color, I warrant you, is as red as any rose, in good	 truth, la. But, i’ faith, you have drunk too much canaries, and that’s a marvellous searching wine, and it perfumes the blood ere one can say “What’s this?” How do you now? 

DOLL Better than I was. Hem.	 

HOSTESS Why, that’s well said. A good heart’s worth gold. Lo, here comes Sir John. 

<ACTION>Enter Sir John Falstaff.</ACTION> 

FALSTAFF ,  <ACTION>singing</ACTION> When Arthur first in court— <ACTION>To Will</ACTION> . Empty the jordan.	 <ACTION>Will exits.</ACTION> And was a worthy king—	 How now, Mistress Doll? 

HOSTESS Sick of a calm, yea, good faith. 

FALSTAFF So is all her sect. An they be once in a calm, they are sick. 

DOLL A pox damn you, you muddy rascal. Is that all the	 comfort you give me? 

FALSTAFF  You make fat rascals, Mistress Doll. 

DOLL I make them? Gluttony and diseases make them; I make them not. 

FALSTAFF If the cook help to make the gluttony, you	 help to make the diseases, Doll. We catch of you, Doll, we catch of you. Grant that, my poor virtue, grant that. 

DOLL Yea, joy, our chains and our jewels. 

FALSTAFF   Your brooches, pearls, and ouches—for to	 serve bravely is to come halting off, you know; to come off the breach with his pike bent bravely, and to surgery bravely, to venture upon the charged chambers bravely— 

DOLL Hang yourself, you muddy conger, hang yourself!	 

HOSTESS By my troth, this is the old fashion. You two never meet but you fall to some discord. You are both, i’ good truth, as rheumatic as two dry toasts. You cannot one bear with another’s confirmities. What the good-year! One must bear, and to Doll	 that must be you. You are the weaker vessel, as they say, the emptier vessel. 

DOLL Can a weak empty vessel bear such a huge full hogshead? There’s a whole merchant’s venture of Bordeaux stuff in him. You have not seen a hulk	 better stuffed in the hold.—Come, I’ll be friends with thee, Jack. Thou art going to the wars, and whether I shall ever see thee again or no, there is nobody cares. 

<ACTION>Enter Drawer.</ACTION> 

DRAWER Sir, Ancient Pistol’s below and would speak	 with you. 

DOLL Hang him, swaggering rascal! Let him not come hither. It is the foul-mouthed’st rogue in England. 

HOSTESS If he swagger, let him not come here. No, by my faith, I must live among my neighbors. I’ll no	75 swaggerers. I am in good name and fame with the very best. Shut the door. There comes no swaggerers here. I have not lived all this while to have swaggering now. Shut the door, I pray you. 

FALSTAFF Dost thou hear, hostess?	 

HOSTESS Pray you pacify yourself, Sir John. There comes no swaggerers here. 

FALSTAFF Dost thou hear? It is mine ancient. 

HOSTESS Tilly-vally, Sir John, ne’er tell me. And your ancient swaggerer comes not in my doors. I was	 before Master Tisick the debuty t’ other day, and, as he said to me—’twas no longer ago than Wednesday last, i’ good faith—“Neighbor Quickly,” says he—Master Dumb, our minister, was by then— “Neighbor Quickly,” says he, “receive those that	 are civil, for,” said he, “you are in an ill name.” Now he said so, I can tell whereupon. “For,” says he, “you are an honest woman, and well thought on. Therefore take heed what guests you receive. Receive,” says he, “no swaggering companions.”	 There comes none here. You would bless you to hear what he said. No, I’ll no swaggerers. 

FALSTAFF He’s no swaggerer, hostess, a tame cheater, i’ faith. You may stroke him as gently as a puppy greyhound. He’ll not swagger with a Barbary hen if	 her feathers turn back in any show of resistance.— Call him up, drawer.  

<ACTION>Drawer exits.</ACTION> 

HOSTESS “Cheater” call you him? I will bar no honest man my house, nor no cheater, but I do not love swaggering. By my troth, I am the worse when one	 says “swagger.” Feel, masters, how I shake; look you, I warrant you. 

DOLL So you do, hostess. 

HOSTESS Do I? Yea, in very truth, do I, an ’twere an aspen leaf. I cannot abide swaggerers.	 

<ACTION>Enter Ancient Pistol, Bardolph, and Page.</ACTION> 

PISTOL  God save you, Sir John. 

FALSTAFF Welcome, Ancient Pistol. Here, Pistol, I charge you with a cup of sack. Do you discharge upon mine hostess. 

PISTOL I will discharge upon her, Sir John, with two	 bullets. 

FALSTAFF   She is pistol-proof. Sir, you shall not hardly offend her. 

HOSTESS Come, I’ll drink no proofs nor no bullets. I’ll drink no more than will do me good, for no man’s	 pleasure, I. 

PISTOL Then, to you, Mistress Dorothy! I will charge you. 

DOLL  Charge me? I scorn you, scurvy companion. What, you poor, base, rascally, cheating lack-linen	 mate! Away, you mouldy rogue, away! I am meat for your master. 

PISTOL I know you, Mistress Dorothy. 

DOLL Away, you cutpurse rascal, you filthy bung, away! By this wine, I’ll thrust my knife in your mouldy	 chaps an you play the saucy cuttle with me. Away, you bottle-ale rascal, you basket-hilt stale juggler, you. Since when, I pray you, sir? God’s light, with two points on your shoulder? Much! 

PISTOL God let me not live but I will murder your ruff	 for this. 

FALSTAFF No more, Pistol. I would not have you go off here. Discharge yourself of our company, Pistol. 

HOSTESS No, good Captain Pistol, not here, sweet captain!	 

DOLL Captain? Thou abominable damned cheater, art thou not ashamed to be called captain? An captains were of my mind, they would truncheon you out for taking their names upon you before you have earned them. You a captain? You slave, for what?	 For tearing a poor whore’s ruff in a bawdy house? He a captain! Hang him, rogue. He lives upon mouldy stewed prunes and dried cakes. A captain? God’s light, these villains will make the word as odious as the word “occupy,” which was an excellent	 good word before it was ill sorted. Therefore captains had need look to ’t. 

BARDOLPH ,  <ACTION>to Pistol</ACTION> Pray thee go down, good ancient. 

FALSTAFF Hark thee hither, Mistress Doll. 

PISTOL ,  <ACTION>to Bardolph</ACTION> Not I. I tell thee what, Corporal	 Bardolph, I could tear her. I’ll be revenged of her. 

PAGE  Pray thee go down. 

PISTOL I’ll see her damned first to Pluto’s damnèd lake, by this hand, to th’ infernal deep with Erebus and tortures vile also. Hold hook and line, say I.	 Down, down, dogs! Down, Fates! Have we not Hiren here?	 <ACTION>He draws his sword.</ACTION> 

HOSTESS  Good Captain Peesell, be quiet. ’Tis very late, i’ faith. I beseek you now, aggravate your choler. 

PISTOL These be good humors indeed. Shall pack-horses	 and hollow pampered jades of Asia, which cannot go but thirty mile a day, compare with Caesars and with cannibals and Troyant Greeks? Nay, rather damn them with King Cerberus, and let the welkin roar. Shall we fall foul for toys?	 

HOSTESS By my troth, captain, these are very bitter words. 

BARDOLPH  Begone, good ancient. This will grow to a brawl anon. 

PISTOL   Die men like dogs! Give crowns like pins! Have we not Hiren here? 

HOSTESS  O’ my word, captain, there’s none such here. What the good-year, do you think I would deny her? For God’s sake, be quiet. 

PISTOL Then feed and be fat, my fair Calipolis. Come,	 give ’s some sack.  <ACTION>Si fortune me tormente, speratome contento. </ACTION> Fear we broadsides? No, let the fiend give fire. Give me some sack, and, sweetheart, lie thou there.  <ACTION>Laying down his sword.</ACTION> Come we to full points here? And are etceteras nothings?	 

FALSTAFF Pistol, I would be quiet. 

PISTOL Sweet knight, I kiss thy neaf. What, we have seen the seven stars. 

DOLL For God’s sake, thrust him downstairs. I cannot endure such a fustian rascal.	 

PISTOL “Thrust him downstairs”? Know we not Galloway nags? 

FALSTAFF Quoit him down, Bardolph, like a shove-groat shilling. Nay, an he do nothing but speak nothing, he shall be nothing here.	 

BARDOLPH  Come, get you downstairs. 

PISTOL ,  <ACTION>taking up his sword</ACTION> What, shall we have incision? Shall we imbrue? Then death rock me asleep, abridge my doleful days. Why then, let grievous, ghastly, gaping wounds untwind the Sisters	 Three. Come, Atropos, I say. 

HOSTESS  Here’s goodly stuff toward! 

FALSTAFF Give me my rapier, boy. 

DOLL I pray thee, Jack, I pray thee do not draw. 

FALSTAFF , <ACTION> to Pistol </ACTION> Get you downstairs.	 <ACTION>They fight.</ACTION> 

HOSTESS  Here’s a goodly tumult. I’ll forswear keeping house afore I’ll be in these tirrits and frights. So, murder, I warrant now. Alas, alas, put up your naked weapons, put up your naked weapons. 

<ACTION>Bardolph and Pistol exit.</ACTION> 

DOLL  I pray thee, Jack, be quiet. The rascal’s gone. Ah,	 you whoreson little valiant villain, you. 

HOSTESS ,  <ACTION>to Falstaff</ACTION> Are you not hurt i’ th’ groin? Methought he made a shrewd thrust at your belly. 

<ACTION>Enter Bardolph.</ACTION> 

FALSTAFF  Have you turned him out o’ doors? 

BARDOLPH   Yea, sir. The rascal’s drunk. You have hurt	 him, sir, i’ th’ shoulder. 

FALSTAFF A rascal to brave me! 

DOLL Ah, you sweet little rogue, you. Alas, poor ape, how thou sweat’st! Come, let me wipe thy face. Come on, you whoreson chops. Ah, rogue, i’ faith, I	 love thee. Thou art as valorous as Hector of Troy, worth five of Agamemnon, and ten times better than the Nine Worthies. Ah, villain! 

FALSTAFF  Ah, rascally slave! I will toss the rogue in a blanket.	 

DOLL  Do, an thou darest for thy heart. An thou dost, I’ll canvass thee between a pair of sheets. 

<ACTION>Enter Musicians and Francis.</ACTION> 

PAGE The music is come, sir. 

FALSTAFF  Let them play.—Play, sirs.—Sit on my knee, Doll. A rascal bragging slave! The rogue fled from	 me like quicksilver. 

DOLL I’ faith, and thou followed’st him like a church. Thou whoreson little tidy Bartholomew boar-pig, when wilt thou leave fighting a-days and foining a-nights and begin to patch up thine old body for heaven? 

<ACTION>Enter behind them Prince and Poins disguised.</ACTION> 

FALSTAFF  Peace, good Doll. Do not speak like a death’s-head; do not bid me remember mine end. 

DOLL Sirrah, what humor’s the Prince of? 

FALSTAFF A good shallow young fellow, he would have	 made a good pantler; he would ’a chipped bread well. 

DOLL They say Poins has a good wit. 

FALSTAFF He a good wit? Hang him, baboon. His wit’s as thick as Tewkesbury mustard. There’s no more	 conceit in him than is in a mallet. 

DOLL Why does the Prince love him so then? 

FALSTAFF Because their legs are both of a bigness, and he plays at quoits well, and eats conger and fennel, and drinks off candles’ ends for flap-dragons, and	 rides the wild mare with the boys, and jumps upon joint stools, and swears with a good grace, and wears his boots very smooth like unto the sign of the Leg, and breeds no bate with telling of discreet stories, and such other gambol faculties he has that	 show a weak mind and an able body, for the which the Prince admits him; for the Prince himself is such another. The weight of a hair will turn the scales between their avoirdupois. 

PRINCE ,  <ACTION>aside to Poins</ACTION> Would not this nave of a wheel	 have his ears cut off? 

POINS Let’s beat him before his whore. 

PRINCE  Look whe’er the withered elder hath not his poll clawed like a parrot. 

POINS Is it not strange that desire should so many years	 outlive performance? 

FALSTAFF  Kiss me, Doll. 

PRINCE ,  <ACTION>aside to Poins  </ACTION> Saturn and Venus this year in conjunction! What says th’ almanac to that? 

POINS And look whether the fiery trigon, his man, be	 not lisping to his master’s old tables, his notebook, his counsel keeper. 

FALSTAFF, <ACTION>to Doll  </ACTION> Thou dost give me flattering busses. 

DOLL By my troth, I kiss thee with a most constant heart.	 

FALSTAFF  I am old, I am old. 

DOLL I love thee better than I love e’er a scurvy young boy of them all. 

FALSTAFF  What stuff wilt thou have a kirtle of? I shall receive money o’ Thursday; thou shalt have a cap	 tomorrow. A merry song! Come, it grows late. We’ll to bed. Thou ’lt forget me when I am gone. 

DOLL By my troth, thou ’lt set me a-weeping an thou sayst so. Prove that ever I dress myself handsome till thy return. Well, harken a’ th’ end.	 

FALSTAFF Some sack, Francis. 

PRINCE, POINS, <ACTION>coming forward</ACTION> Anon, anon, sir. 

FALSTAFF Ha? A bastard son of the King’s?—And art not thou Poins his brother? 

PRINCE   Why, thou globe of sinful continents, what a	 life dost thou lead? 

FALSTAFF A better than thou. I am a gentleman. Thou art a drawer. 

PRINCE   Very true, sir, and I come to draw you out by the ears. 

HOSTESS O, the Lord preserve thy good Grace! By my troth, welcome to London. Now the Lord bless that sweet face of thine. O Jesu, are you come from Wales? 

FALSTAFF ,  <ACTION>to Prince</ACTION> Thou whoreson mad compound	 of majesty, by this light flesh and corrupt blood, thou art welcome. 

DOLL  How? You fat fool, I scorn you. 

POINS My lord, he will drive you out of your revenge and turn all to a merriment if you take not the heat.	 

PRINCE ,  <ACTION>to Falstaff</ACTION> You whoreson candle-mine, you, how vilely did you speak of me even now before this honest, virtuous, civil gentlewoman! 

HOSTESS God’s blessing of your good heart, and so she is, by my troth.	 

FALSTAFF, <ACTION>to Prince</ACTION> Didst thou hear me? 

PRINCE Yea, and you knew me as you did when you ran away by Gad’s Hill. You knew I was at your back, and spoke it on purpose to try my patience. 

FALSTAFF No, no, no, not so. I did not think thou wast	 within hearing. 

PRINCE I shall drive you, then, to confess the wilfull abuse, and then I know how to handle you. 

FALSTAFF  No abuse, Hal, o’ mine honor, no abuse. 

PRINCE Not to dispraise me and call me pantler and	 bread-chipper and I know not what? 

FALSTAFF  No abuse, Hal. 

POINS   No abuse? 

FALSTAFF No abuse, Ned, i’ th’ world, honest Ned, none. I dispraised him before the wicked, (to	 Prince) that the wicked might not fall in love with thee; in which doing, I have done the part of a careful friend and a true subject, and thy father is to give me thanks for it. No abuse, Hal.—None, Ned, none. No, faith, boys, none.	 

PRINCE  See now whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to close with us. Is she of the wicked, is thine hostess here of the wicked, or is thy boy of the wicked, or honest Bardolph, whose zeal burns in his nose, of the wicked? 

POINS Answer, thou dead elm, answer. 

FALSTAFF   The fiend hath pricked down Bardolph irrecoverable, and his face is Lucifer’s privy kitchen, where he doth nothing but roast malt-worms. For	 the boy, there is a good angel about him, but the devil blinds him too. 

PRINCE For the women? 

FALSTAFF  For one of them, she’s in hell already and burns poor souls. For th’ other, I owe her money,	 and whether she be damned for that I know not. 

HOSTESS  No, I warrant you. 

FALSTAFF No, I think thou art not. I think thou art quit for that. Marry, there is another indictment upon thee for suffering flesh to be eaten in thy house	 contrary to the law, for the which I think thou wilt howl. 

HOSTESS  All vitlars do so. What’s a joint of mutton or two in a whole Lent? 

PRINCE ,  <ACTION>to Doll</ACTION> You, gentlewoman.	 

DOLL  What says your Grace? 

FALSTAFF  His grace says that which his flesh rebels against. 

<ACTION>Peto knocks at door.</ACTION> 

HOSTESS Who knocks so loud at door? Look to th’ door there, Francis.	 <ACTION>Francis exits.  </ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Peto.</ACTION> 

PRINCE Peto, how now, what news? 

PETO The King your father is at Westminster, And there are twenty weak and wearied posts Come from the north, and as I came along I met and overtook a dozen captains,	 Bareheaded, sweating, knocking at the taverns And asking everyone for Sir John Falstaff. 

PRINCE By heaven, Poins, I feel me much to blame So idly to profane the precious time When tempest of commotion, like the south	 Borne with black vapor, doth begin to melt And drop upon our bare unarmèd heads.— Give me my sword and cloak.—Falstaff, good night.	 <ACTION>Prince, Peto, and Poins exit.</ACTION> 

FALSTAFF  Now comes in the sweetest morsel of the	 night, and we must hence and leave it unpicked. 

<ACTION>(Knocking. Bardolph exits.)</ACTION> More knocking at the door?  <ACTION>(Bardolph returns.) </ACTION> How now, what’s the matter? 

BARDOLPH You must away to court, sir, presently.	 A dozen captains stay at door for you. 

FALSTAFF ,  <ACTION>to Page</ACTION> Pay the musicians, sirrah.— Farewell, hostess.—Farewell, Doll. You see, my good wenches, how men of merit are sought after. The undeserver may sleep when the man of action	 is called on. Farewell, good wenches. If I be not sent away post, I will see you again ere I go. 

DOLL I cannot speak. If my heart be not ready to burst—well, sweet Jack, have a care of thyself. 

FALSTAFF Farewell, farewell.	 

<ACTION>He exits with Bardolph, Page, and Musicians.</ACTION> 

HOSTESS Well, fare thee well. I have known thee these twenty-nine years, come peasecod time, but an honester and truer-hearted man—well, fare thee well. 

BARDOLPH ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> Mistress Tearsheet!	 

HOSTESS What’s the matter? 

BARDOLPH ,  <ACTION>within  </ACTION> Bid Mistress Tearsheet come to my master. 

HOSTESS O, run, Doll, run, run, good Doll. Come.— She comes blubbered.—Yea! Will you come, Doll?	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
