When he hears about Harpagon's plans for Élise, Valère stalls at first, saying that it's important for a woman to love her future husband. But Harpagon keeps responding to all of this by saying that Mr. Anselme isn't asking for a dowry, which will save Harpagon tons of money. While Valère tries to talk Harpagon out of his decision to marry off Élise, Harpagon thinks he hears a dog barking in the garden. He becomes worried that someone is after his buried treasure, and he slips out of the room to check.
