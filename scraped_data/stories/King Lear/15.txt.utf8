<ACTION>Enter Cornwall, Regan, Goneril, Edmund, the Bastard,and Servants.</ACTION> 

CORNWALL ,  <ACTION>to Goneril</ACTION> Post speedily to my lord your husband. Show him this letter.  <ACTION>He gives her apaper.</ACTION> The army of France is landed.—Seek out the traitor Gloucester.	 <ACTION>Some Servants exit.</ACTION> 

REGAN Hang him instantly.	 

GONERIL Pluck out his eyes. 

CORNWALL Leave him to my displeasure.—Edmund, keep you our sister company. The revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous father are not fit for your beholding. Advise the Duke, where you	 are going, to a most festinate preparation; we are bound to the like. Our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us.—Farewell, dear sister.— Farewell, my lord of Gloucester. 

<ACTION>Enter Oswald, the Steward.</ACTION> 

How now? Where’s the King?	 

OSWALD My lord of Gloucester hath conveyed him hence. Some five- or six-and-thirty of his knights, Hot questrists after him, met him at gate, Who, with some other of the lord’s dependents, Are gone with him toward Dover, where they boast	 To have well-armèd friends. 

CORNWALL  Get horses for your mistress. 

<ACTION>Oswald exits.</ACTION> 

GONERIL Farewell, sweet lord, and sister. 

CORNWALL Edmund, farewell.	 <ACTION>Goneril and Edmund exit.</ACTION> Go seek the traitor Gloucester.	 Pinion him like a thief; bring him before us. 

<ACTION>Some Servants exit.</ACTION> 

Though well we may not pass upon his life Without the form of justice, yet our power Shall do a court’sy to our wrath, which men May blame but not control.	 

<ACTION>Enter Gloucester and Servants.</ACTION> 

Who’s there? The traitor? 

REGAN Ingrateful fox! ’Tis he. 

CORNWALL Bind fast his corky arms. 

GLOUCESTER What means your Graces? Good my friends,	 consider You are my guests; do me no foul play, friends. 

CORNWALL Bind him, I say. 

REGAN Hard, hard. O filthy traitor! 

GLOUCESTER Unmerciful lady as you are, I’m none.	 

CORNWALL To this chair bind him.	Servants bind Gloucester. Villain, thou shalt find— 

<ACTION>Regan plucks Gloucester’s beard.</ACTION> 

GLOUCESTER By the kind gods, ’tis most ignobly done To pluck me by the beard. 

REGAN So white, and such a traitor?	 

GLOUCESTER Naughty lady, These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin Will quicken and accuse thee. I am your host; With robber’s hands my hospitable favors You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?	 

CORNWALL Come, sir, what letters had you late from France? 

REGAN Be simple-answered, for we know the truth. 

CORNWALL And what confederacy have you with the traitors Late footed in the kingdom? 

REGAN To whose hands	 You have sent the lunatic king. Speak. 

GLOUCESTER I have a letter guessingly set down Which came from one that’s of a neutral heart, And not from one opposed. 

CORNWALL Cunning.	 

REGAN  And false. 

CORNWALL Where hast thou sent the King? 

GLOUCESTER To Dover. 

REGAN Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril—	 

CORNWALL Wherefore to Dover? Let him answer that. 

GLOUCESTER I am tied to th’ stake, and I must stand the course. 

REGAN  Wherefore to Dover? 

GLOUCESTER Because I would not see thy cruel nails Pluck out his poor old eyes, nor thy fierce sister	 In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs. The sea, with such a storm as his bare head In hell-black night endured, would have buoyed up And quenched the stellèd fires; Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.	 If wolves had at thy gate howled that stern time, Thou shouldst have said “Good porter, turn the key.” All cruels else subscribe. But I shall see The wingèd vengeance overtake such children.	 

CORNWALL See ’t shalt thou never.—Fellows, hold the chair.— Upon these eyes of thine I’ll set my foot. 

GLOUCESTER He that will think to live till he be old, Give me some help! 

<ACTION>As Servants hold the chair, Cornwall forces outone of Gloucester’s eyes.</ACTION> 

O cruel! O you gods!	 

REGAN One side will mock another. Th’ other too. 

CORNWALL If you see vengeance— 

FIRST SERVANT Hold your hand, my lord. I have served you ever since I was a child,	 But better service have I never done you Than now to bid you hold. 

REGAN How now, you dog? 

FIRST SERVANT If you did wear a beard upon your chin, I’d shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?	 

CORNWALL My villain?	 <ACTION>Draw and fight.</ACTION> 

FIRST SERVANT Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger. 

REGAN ,  <ACTION>to an Attendant</ACTION> Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus? She takes a sword and runs at him behind;  <ACTION>kills him.</ACTION> 

FIRST SERVANT O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left To see some mischief on him. O!	 <ACTION>He dies.</ACTION> 

CORNWALL Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly! <ACTION>Forcing out Gloucester’s other eye.</ACTION> Where is thy luster now? 

GLOUCESTER All dark and comfortless! Where’s my son Edmund?— Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature	 To quit this horrid act. 

REGAN  Out, treacherous villain! Thou call’st on him that hates thee. It was he That made the overture of thy treasons to us, Who is too good to pity thee.	 

GLOUCESTER O my follies! Then Edgar was abused. Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him. 

REGAN Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell His way to Dover. <ACTION>Some Servants exit with Gloucester.</ACTION> How is ’t, my lord? How look you?	 

CORNWALL I have received a hurt. Follow me, lady.— Turn out that eyeless villain. Throw this slave Upon the dunghill.—Regan, I bleed apace. Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm. 

<ACTION>Cornwall and Regan exit.</ACTION> 

SECOND SERVANT I’ll never care what wickedness I do	 If this man come to good. 

THIRD SERVANT If she live long And in the end meet the old course of death, Women will all turn monsters. 

SECOND SERVANT Let’s follow the old earl and get the Bedlam	 To lead him where he would. His roguish madness Allows itself to anything. 

THIRD SERVANT Go thou. I’ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs To apply to his bleeding face. Now heaven help him! 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
