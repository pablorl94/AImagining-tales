GOWER Here have you seen a mighty king His child, iwis, to incest bring; A better prince and benign lord That will prove awful both in deed and word. Be quiet, then, as men should be,	 Till he hath passed necessity. I’ll show you those in troubles reign, Losing a mite, a mountain gain. The good in conversation, To whom I give my benison,	 Is still at Tarsus, where each man Thinks all is Writ he speken can, And, to remember what he does, Build his statue to make him glorious. But tidings to the contrary	 Are brought your eyes. What need speak I?

Good Helicane, that stayed at home— Not to eat honey like a drone From others’ labors, for though he strive To killen bad, keep good alive,	 And to fulfill his prince’ desire— Sends word of all that haps in Tyre: How Thaliard came full bent with sin, And had intent to murder him; And that in Tarsus was not best Longer for him to make his rest. He, doing so, put forth to seas, Where when men been there’s seldom ease; For now the wind begins to blow; Thunder above and deeps below	 Makes such unquiet that the ship Should house him safe is wracked and split, And he, good prince, having all lost, By waves from coast to coast is tossed. All perishen of man, of pelf,	 Ne aught escapend but himself; Till Fortune, tired with doing bad, Threw him ashore to give him glad. And here he comes. What shall be next, Pardon old Gower—this ’longs the text.
