Does Pete know how to party? You betcha. He loves himself a spectacle, so he takes Maggie to music halls, burlesque shows, and all manner of lowbrow entertainment. For Maggie, the escape from life at home is more than welcome.

She really digs hanging out with Pete at the smoky orchestra performances, drinking beer and mingling with the masses. Pete stands out because he's a real gentleman, and she loves how he works the whole classy angle for her.

But Maggie sees Pete as more than just a night at the theater spent watching people sing and ventriloquists do their acts—he's her ticket out of the dump that is Rum Alley.

Pete's really into Maggie, too; she can tell because he stares at her a lot and asks her to kiss him. She's not down for smooching, though. Bummer for Pete—he thought he was going to get some.
