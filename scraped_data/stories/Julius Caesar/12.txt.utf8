CASSIUS That you have wronged me doth appear in this: You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella For taking bribes here of the Sardians, Wherein my letters, praying on his side Because I knew the man, was slighted off.	 

BRUTUS You wronged yourself to write in such a case. 

CASSIUS In such a time as this it is not meet That every nice offense should bear his comment. 

BRUTUS Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself Are much condemned to have an itching palm,	 To sell and mart your offices for gold To undeservers. 

CASSIUS I an itching palm? You know that you are Brutus that speaks this, Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.	 

BRUTUS The name of Cassius honors this corruption, And chastisement doth therefore hide his head. 

CASSIUS Chastisement? 

BRUTUS Remember March; the ides of March remember. Did not great Julius bleed for justice’ sake?	 What villain touched his body that did stab And not for justice? What, shall one of us That struck the foremost man of all this world But for supporting robbers, shall we now Contaminate our fingers with base bribes	 And sell the mighty space of our large honors For so much trash as may be graspèd thus? I had rather be a dog and bay the moon Than such a Roman. 

CASSIUS Brutus, bait not me.	 I’ll not endure it. You forget yourself To hedge me in. I am a soldier, I, Older in practice, abler than yourself To make conditions. 

BRUTUS Go to! You are not, Cassius.	 

CASSIUS I am. 

BRUTUS I say you are not. 

CASSIUS Urge me no more. I shall forget myself. Have mind upon your health. Tempt me no farther. 

BRUTUS Away, slight man!	 

CASSIUS Is ’t possible? 

BRUTUS Hear me, for I will speak. Must I give way and room to your rash choler? Shall I be frighted when a madman stares? 

CASSIUS O you gods, you gods, must I endure all this?	 

BRUTUS All this? Ay, more. Fret till your proud heart break. Go show your slaves how choleric you are And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge? Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch Under your testy humor? By the gods,	 You shall digest the venom of your spleen Though it do split you. For, from this day forth, I’ll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter, When you are waspish. 

CASSIUS  Is it come to this?	 

BRUTUS You say you are a better soldier. Let it appear so, make your vaunting true, And it shall please me well. For mine own part, I shall be glad to learn of noble men. 

CASSIUS You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.	 I said an elder soldier, not a better. Did I say “better”? 

BRUTUS If you did, I care not. 

CASSIUS When Caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me.		 

BRUTUS Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him. 

CASSIUS I durst not? 

BRUTUS  No. 

CASSIUS What? Durst not tempt him? 

BRUTUS  For your life you durst	 not. 

CASSIUS Do not presume too much upon my love. I may do that I shall be sorry for. 

BRUTUS You have done that you should be sorry for. There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,	 For I am armed so strong in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind, Which I respect not. I did send to you For certain sums of gold, which you denied me, For I can raise no money by vile means.	 By heaven, I had rather coin my heart And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash By any indirection. I did send To you for gold to pay my legions,	 Which you denied me. Was that done like Cassius? Should I have answered Caius Cassius so? When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous To lock such rascal counters from his friends, Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;	 Dash him to pieces! 

CASSIUS I denied you not. 

BRUTUS You did. 

CASSIUS I did not. He was but a fool that brought My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart.	 A friend should bear his friend’s infirmities, But Brutus makes mine greater than they are. 

BRUTUS I do not, till you practice them on me. 

CASSIUS You love me not. 

BRUTUS I do not like your faults.	 

CASSIUS A friendly eye could never see such faults. 

BRUTUS A flatterer’s would not, though they do appear As huge as high Olympus. 

CASSIUS Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come! Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,	 For Cassius is aweary of the world— Hated by one he loves, braved by his brother, Checked like a bondman, all his faults observed, Set in a notebook, learned and conned by rote To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep	 My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger, 

<ACTION>Offering his dagger to Brutus.</ACTION> 

And here my naked breast; within, a heart Dearer than Pluto’s mine, richer than gold. If that thou be’st a Roman, take it forth. I that denied thee gold will give my heart.	 Strike as thou didst at Caesar, for I know When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better Than ever thou lovedst Cassius. 

BRUTUS Sheathe your	 dagger. Be angry when you will, it shall have scope. Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor. O Cassius, you are yokèd with a lamb That carries anger as the flint bears fire,	 Who, much enforcèd, shows a hasty spark And straight is cold again. 

CASSIUS Hath Cassius lived To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus When grief and blood ill-tempered vexeth him?	 

BRUTUS When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered too. 

CASSIUS Do you confess so much? Give me your hand. 

BRUTUS And my heart too.	They clasp hands. 

CASSIUS O Brutus! 

BRUTUS What’s the matter?	 

CASSIUS Have not you love enough to bear with me When that rash humor which my mother gave me Makes me forgetful? 

BRUTUS Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth	 When you are over-earnest with your Brutus, He’ll think your mother chides, and leave you so. 

<ACTION>Enter a Poet followed by Lucilius, Titinius, and Lucius.</ACTION> 

POET Let me go in to see the Generals. There is some grudge between ’em; ’tis not meet They be alone.	 

LUCILIUS You shall not come to them. 

POET Nothing but death shall stay me. 

CASSIUS  How now, what’s the matter? 

POET For shame, you generals, what do you mean? Love and be friends as two such men should be,	 For I have seen more years, I’m sure, than ye. 

CASSIUS Ha, ha, how vilely doth this cynic rhyme! 

BRUTUS Get you hence, sirrah! Saucy fellow, hence! 

CASSIUS Bear with him, Brutus. ’Tis his fashion. 

BRUTUS I’ll know his humor when he knows his time.	 What should the wars do with these jigging fools?— Companion, hence! 

CASSIUS Away, away, be gone!	 <ACTION>Poet exits.</ACTION> 

BRUTUS Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.	 

CASSIUS And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you Immediately to us.	 <ACTION>Lucilius and Titinius exit.</ACTION> 

BRUTUS Lucius, a bowl of wine.	 <ACTION>Lucius exits.</ACTION> 

CASSIUS I did not think you could have been so angry. 

BRUTUS O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.	 

CASSIUS Of your philosophy you make no use If you give place to accidental evils. 

BRUTUS No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead. 

CASSIUS Ha? Portia? 

BRUTUS She is dead.	 

CASSIUS How ’scaped I killing when I crossed you so? O insupportable and touching loss! Upon what sickness? 

BRUTUS Impatient of my absence, And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony	 Have made themselves so strong—for with her death That tidings came—with this she fell distract And, her attendants absent, swallowed fire. 

CASSIUS And died so?	 

BRUTUS Even so. 

CASSIUS O you immortal gods! 

<ACTION>Enter Lucius with wine and tapers.</ACTION> 

BRUTUS Speak no more of her.—Give me a bowl of wine.— In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.	 <ACTION>He drinks.</ACTION> 

CASSIUS My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.—	 Fill, Lucius, till the wine o’erswell the cup; I cannot drink too much of Brutus’ love.	 <ACTION>He drinks.Lucius exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Titinius and Messala.</ACTION> 

BRUTUS Come in, Titinius. Welcome, good Messala. Now sit we close about this taper here, And call in question our necessities.	 <ACTION>They sit.  </ACTION> 

CASSIUS Portia, art thou gone? 

BRUTUS No more, I pray you.— Messala, I have here receivèd letters That young Octavius and Mark Antony Come down upon us with a mighty power,	 Bending their expedition toward Philippi. 

MESSALA Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor. 

BRUTUS  With what addition? 

MESSALA That by proscription and bills of outlawry, Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus	 Have put to death an hundred senators. 

BRUTUS Therein our letters do not well agree. Mine speak of seventy senators that died By their proscriptions, Cicero being one. 

CASSIUS Cicero one?	 

MESSALA Cicero is dead, And by that order of proscription. Had you your letters from your wife, my lord? 

BRUTUS No, Messala. 

MESSALA Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?	 

BRUTUS Nothing, Messala. 

MESSALA  That methinks is strange. 

BRUTUS Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours? 

MESSALA No, my lord. 

BRUTUS Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.	 

MESSALA Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell, For certain she is dead, and by strange manner. 

BRUTUS Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala. With meditating that she must die once, I have the patience to endure it now.	 

MESSALA Even so great men great losses should endure. 

CASSIUS I have as much of this in art as you, But yet my nature could not bear it so. 

BRUTUS Well, to our work alive. What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently?	 

CASSIUS I do not think it good. 

BRUTUS Your reason? 

CASSIUS  This it is: ’Tis better that the enemy seek us; So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,	 Doing himself offense, whilst we, lying still, Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness. 

BRUTUS Good reasons must of force give place to better. The people ’twixt Philippi and this ground Do stand but in a forced affection,	 For they have grudged us contribution. The enemy, marching along by them, By them shall make a fuller number up, Come on refreshed, new-added, and encouraged, From which advantage shall we cut him off	 If at Philippi we do face him there, These people at our back. 

CASSIUS  Hear me, good brother— 

BRUTUS Under your pardon. You must note besides That we have tried the utmost of our friends,	 Our legions are brim full, our cause is ripe. The enemy increaseth every day; We, at the height, are ready to decline. There is a tide in the affairs of men Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;	 Omitted, all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat, And we must take the current when it serves Or lose our ventures.	 

CASSIUS Then, with your will, go on; We’ll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi. 

BRUTUS The deep of night is crept upon our talk, And nature must obey necessity, Which we will niggard with a little rest.	 There is no more to say. 

CASSIUS No more. Good night. <ACTION>They stand.</ACTION> Early tomorrow will we rise and hence. 

BRUTUS Lucius. 

<ACTION>Enter Lucius.</ACTION> 

My gown.	 <ACTION>Lucius exits.  </ACTION> Farewell, good Messala.— Good night, Titinius.—Noble, noble Cassius, Good night and good repose. 

CASSIUS  O my dear brother, This was an ill beginning of the night.	 Never come such division ’tween our souls! Let it not, Brutus. 

<ACTION>Enter Lucius with the gown.</ACTION> 

BRUTUS Everything is well. 

CASSIUS Good night, my lord. 

BRUTUS Good night, good brother.	 

TITINIUS/MESSALA Good night, Lord Brutus. 

BRUTUS Farewell, everyone. 

<ACTION>All but Brutus and Lucius exit.</ACTION> 

Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument? 

LUCIUS Here in the tent. 

BRUTUS What, thou speak’st drowsily?	 Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o’erwatched. Call Claudius and some other of my men; I’ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent. 

LUCIUS Varro and Claudius. 

<ACTION>Enter Varro and Claudius.</ACTION> 

VARRO Calls my lord?	 

BRUTUS I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep. It may be I shall raise you by and by On business to my brother Cassius. 

VARRO So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.	 

BRUTUS I will not have it so. Lie down, good sirs. It may be I shall otherwise bethink me. <ACTION>They lie down.</ACTION> Look, Lucius, here’s the book I sought for so. I put it in the pocket of my gown. 

LUCIUS I was sure your Lordship did not give it me.	 

BRUTUS Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful. Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile And touch thy instrument a strain or two? 

LUCIUS Ay, my lord, an ’t please you. 

BRUTUS  It does, my boy.	 I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing. 

LUCIUS It is my duty, sir. 

BRUTUS I should not urge thy duty past thy might. I know young bloods look for a time of rest. 

LUCIUS  I have slept, my lord, already.	 

BRUTUS It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again. I will not hold thee long. If I do live, I will be good to thee. 

<ACTION>Music and a song. Lucius then falls asleep.</ACTION> 

This is a sleepy tune. O murd’rous slumber, Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,	 That plays thee music?—Gentle knave, good night. I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee. If thou dost nod, thou break’st thy instrument. I’ll take it from thee and, good boy, good night. He moves the instrument. Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turned down	 Where I left reading? Here it is, I think. How ill this taper burns. 

<ACTION>Enter the Ghost of Caesar.</ACTION> 

Ha, who comes here?— I think it is the weakness of mine eyes That shapes this monstrous apparition.	 It comes upon me.—Art thou any thing? Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil, That mak’st my blood cold and my hair to stare? Speak to me what thou art. 

GHOST Thy evil spirit, Brutus.	 

BRUTUS Why com’st thou? 

GHOST To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi. 

BRUTUS Well, then I shall see thee again? 

GHOST Ay, at Philippi. 

BRUTUS Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.	 <ACTION>Ghost exits.</ACTION> Now I have taken heart, thou vanishest. Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.— Boy, Lucius!—Varro, Claudius, sirs, awake! Claudius! 

LUCIUS The strings, my lord, are false.	 

BRUTUS He thinks he still is at his instrument. Lucius, awake! 

LUCIUS My lord? 

BRUTUS Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out? 

LUCIUS My lord, I do not know that I did cry.	 

BRUTUS Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything? 

LUCIUS Nothing, my lord. 

BRUTUS Sleep again, Lucius.—Sirrah Claudius! <ACTION>To Varro.</ACTION> Fellow thou, awake!	 <ACTION>They rise up.</ACTION> 

VARRO My lord?	 

CLAUDIUS My lord? 

BRUTUS Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep? 

BOTH Did we, my lord? 

BRUTUS  Ay. Saw you anything? 

VARRO No, my lord, I saw nothing.	 

CLAUDIUS  Nor I, my lord. 

BRUTUS Go and commend me to my brother Cassius. Bid him set on his powers betimes before, And we will follow. 

BOTH It shall be done, my lord.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
