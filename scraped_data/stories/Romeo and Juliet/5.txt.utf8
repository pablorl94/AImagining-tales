<ACTION>Servingmen come forth with napkins.</ACTION> 

FIRST SERVINGMAN Where’s Potpan that he helps not to take away? He shift a trencher? He scrape a trencher? 

SECOND SERVINGMAN When good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands, and they unwashed	 too, ’tis a foul thing. 

FIRST SERVINGMAN Away with the joint stools, remove the court cupboard, look to the plate.— Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane, and, as thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone	 and Nell.—Anthony and Potpan! 

THIRD SERVINGMAN Ay, boy, ready. 

FIRST SERVINGMAN  You are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for, in the great chamber. 

THIRD SERVINGMAN  We cannot be here and there too.	 Cheerly, boys! Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.	 

<ACTION>They move aside.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Capulet and his household, all the guests andgentlewomen to Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, and theother Maskers.</ACTION> 

CAPULET Welcome, gentlemen. Ladies that have their toes Unplagued with corns will walk a bout with you.—	 Ah, my mistresses, which of you all Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty, She, I’ll swear, hath corns. Am I come near you now?— Welcome, gentlemen. I have seen the day	 That I have worn a visor and could tell A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear, Such as would please. ’Tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone. You are welcome, gentlemen.—Come, musicians, play.	 <ACTION>Music plays and they dance.</ACTION> A hall, a hall, give room!—And foot it, girls.— More light, you knaves, and turn the tables up, And quench the fire; the room is grown too hot.— Ah, sirrah, this unlooked-for sport comes well.— Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,	 For you and I are past our dancing days. How long is ’t now since last yourself and I Were in a mask? 

CAPULET’S COUSIN By ’r Lady, thirty years. 

CAPULET What, man, ’tis not so much, ’tis not so much.	 ’Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio, Come Pentecost as quickly as it will, Some five and twenty years, and then we masked. 

CAPULET’S COUSIN ’Tis more, ’tis more. His son is elder, sir. His son is thirty.	 

CAPULET Will you tell me that? His son was but a ward two years ago. 

ROMEO ,  <ACTION>to a Servingman</ACTION> What lady’s that which doth enrich the hand Of yonder knight? 

SERVINGMAN I know not, sir.	 

ROMEO O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night As a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s ear— Beauty too rich for use, for Earth too dear. So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows	 As yonder lady o’er her fellows shows. The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand And, touching hers, make blessèd my rude hand. Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight, For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.	 

TYBALT This, by his voice, should be a Montague.— Fetch me my rapier, boy.	 <ACTION>Page exits.</ACTION> What, dares the slave Come hither covered with an antic face To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?	 Now, by the stock and honor of my kin, To strike him dead I hold it not a sin. 

CAPULET Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so? 

TYBALT Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe, A villain that is hither come in spite	 To scorn at our solemnity this night. 

CAPULET Young Romeo is it? 

TYBALT ’Tis he, that villain Romeo. 

CAPULET Content thee, gentle coz. Let him alone. He bears him like a portly gentleman,	 And, to say truth, Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well-governed youth. I would not for the wealth of all this town Here in my house do him disparagement. Therefore be patient. Take no note of him.	 It is my will, the which if thou respect, Show a fair presence and put off these frowns, An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast. 

TYBALT It fits when such a villain is a guest. I’ll not endure him.	 

CAPULET He shall be endured. What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to. Am I the master here or you? Go to. You’ll not endure him! God shall mend my soul, You’ll make a mutiny among my guests,	 You will set cock-a-hoop, you’ll be the man! 

TYBALT Why, uncle, ’tis a shame. 

CAPULET  Go to, go to. You are a saucy boy. Is ’t so indeed? This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.	 You must contrary me. Marry, ’tis time— Well said, my hearts.—You are a princox, go. Be quiet, or—More light, more light!—for shame, I’ll make you quiet.—What, cheerly, my hearts! 

TYBALT Patience perforce with willful choler meeting	 Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting. I will withdraw, but this intrusion shall, Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt’rest gall. <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

ROMEO ,  <ACTION>taking Juliet’s hand</ACTION> If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this:	 My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss. 

JULIET Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,	 And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss. 

ROMEO Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? 

JULIET Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. 

ROMEO O then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.	 

JULIET Saints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake. 

ROMEO Then move not while my prayer’s effect I take. <ACTION>He kisses her.</ACTION> Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged. 

JULIET Then have my lips the sin that they have took. 

ROMEO Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged!	 Give me my sin again.	 <ACTION>He kisses her.</ACTION> 

JULIET  You kiss by th’ book. 

NURSE Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Juliet moves toward her mother. 

ROMEO What is her mother? 

NURSE Marry, bachelor,	 Her mother is the lady of the house, And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous. I nursed her daughter that you talked withal. I tell you, he that can lay hold of her Shall have the chinks.	Nurse moves away.   

ROMEO ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Is she a Capulet? O dear account! My life is my foe’s debt. 

BENVOLIO Away, begone. The sport is at the best. 

ROMEO Ay, so I fear. The more is my unrest. 

CAPULET Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone.	 We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.— Is it e’en so? Why then, I thank you all. I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.— More torches here.—Come on then, let’s to bed.— Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late.	 I’ll to my rest. 

<ACTION>All but Juliet and the Nurse begin to exit.</ACTION> 

JULIET Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman? 

NURSE The son and heir of old Tiberio. 

JULIET What’s he that now is going out of door? 

NURSE Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.	 

JULIET What’s he that follows here, that would not dance? 

NURSE I know not. 

JULIET Go ask his name. <ACTION> The Nurse goes.</ACTION> If he be marrièd, My grave is like to be my wedding bed. 

NURSE ,  <ACTION>returning</ACTION> His name is Romeo, and a Montague,	 The only son of your great enemy. 

JULIET My only love sprung from my only hate! Too early seen unknown, and known too late! Prodigious birth of love it is to me That I must love a loathèd enemy.	 

NURSE What’s this? What’s this? 

JULIET  A rhyme I learned even now Of one I danced withal. 

<ACTION>One calls within “Juliet.”</ACTION> 

NURSE  Anon, anon. Come, let’s away. The strangers all are gone.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
