_Re-enter_ ELECTRA. 

EL. O dearest women! they are even now About it. Only bide in silence still. 

CH. What is the present scene? 

EL.                            She decks the vase For burial, and they both are standing by. 

CH. And wherefore hast thou darted forth? 

EL.                                       To watch Aegisthus' coming, that he enter not At unawares. 

CLY. (_within_). Ah! ah! Woe for the house, Desert of friends, and filled with hands of death! 

EL. A cry within! Did ye not hear it, friends? 

CH. Would I had not! I heard, and shivered through. 

CLY. (_within_). Oh me! Alas, Aegisthus! where art thou? 

EL. Hark! yet again that sound! 

CLY. (_within_).           O son, have pity! Pity the womb that bare thee. 

EL.                           Thou hadst none For him, nor for his father, in that day. 

HALF-CH. Poor city! hapless race!                                    1 Thy destiny to-day Wears thee away, away. What morn shall see thy face? 

CLY. (_within_). Oh, I am smitten! 

EL.                Give a second stroke, If thou hast power. 

CLY. (_within_). Oh me! again, again! 

EL. Would thou wert shrieking for Aegisthus too! 

CH. The curse hath found, and they in earth who lie Are living powers to-day. Long dead, they drain away The streaming blood of those who made them die. 

_Enter_ ORESTES _and_ PYLADES. 

Behold, they come, they come! His red hand dripping as he moves With drops of sacrifice the War-god loves. My 'wildered heart is dumb. 

EL. How is it with you, brother? 

OR.                              If Apollo Spake rightfully, the state within is well. 

EL. Wretched one, is she dead? 

OR.                            No more have fear Thou shalt be slighted by thy mother's will. 

CH. Cease, for I see Aegisthus near in view. 

EL. In, in again, boys! 

OR.                     Where do ye behold The tyrant? 

EL.         To our hand from yonder gate He comes with beaming look. 

HALF-CH. Haste, with what speed ye may,                              2 Stand on the doorway stone, That, having thus much done, Ye may do all to-day. 

OR. Fear not: we will perform it. 

EL.                               Speed ye now: Follow your thought. 

OR.                  We are already there. 

EL. Leave matters here to me. All shall go well. [_Exit_ ORESTES _with_ PYLADES 

CH. Few words, as if in gentleness, 'twere good To utter in his ear, That, eager and unware, One step may launch him on the field of blood. 

_Enter_ AEGISTHUS. 

AEGISTHUS. Which of you know where are the Phocian men Who brought the news I hear, Orestes' life Hath suffered shipwreck in a chariot-race? You, you I question, you in former time So fearless! You methinks most feelingly Can tell us, for it touches you most near. 

EL. I know: assure thee. Else had I not heard The dearest of all fortunes to my heart. 

AEG. Where are the strangers then? Enlighten me. 

EL. Yonder. Their hostess entertained them well. 

AEG. And did they certainly report him dead? 

EL. Not only so. They showed him to our sight. 

AEG. May this clear evidence be mine to see? 

EL. I envy not the sight that waits you there. 

AEG. Against their wont thy words have given me joy. 

EL. Much joy be thine, if this be joy to thee! 

AEG. Silence, I say! Wide let the gates be flung! For all the Myceneans to behold And all in Argolis, that if but one Hath heretofore been buoyed on empty hopes Fixed in Orestes, seeing him now dead, He may accept my manage, and not wait For our stern chastisement to teach him sense. 

EL. My lesson is already learnt: at length I am schooled to labour with the stronger will. [_The body of_ CLYTEMNESTRA _is disclosed under a veil:_ ORESTES _standing by_ 

AEG. Zeus! Divine envy surely hath laid low The form I here behold. But if the truth Provoke Heaven's wrath, be it unexpressed.--Unveil! Off with all hindrance, that mine eye may see, And I may mourn my kinsman as I should. 

OR. Thyself put forth thy hand. Not mine but thine To look and speak with kindness to this corse. 

AEG. I will, for thou advisest well; but thou, Call Clytemnestra, if she be within.     [AEGISTHUS _lifts the shroud_ 

OR. She is beside thee, gaze not otherwhere. 

AEG. What do I see! oh! 

OR.                     Why so strange? Whom fear you? 

AEG. Who are the men into whose midmost toils All hapless I am fallen? 

OR.                      Ha! knowest thou not Thou hast been taking living men for dead?[11] 

AEG. I understand that saying. Woe is me! I know, Orestes' voice addresseth me. 

OR. A prophet! How wert thou so long deceived? 

AEG. Undone, undone! Yet let me speak one word. 

EL. Brother, by Heaven, no more! Let him not speak. When death is certain, what do men in woe Gain from a little time? Kill him at once! And, killed, expose him to such burial From dogs and vultures, as beseemeth such, Far from our view. Nought less will solace me For the remembrance of a life of pain. 

OR. Go in and tarry not. No contest this Of verbal question, but of life or death. 

AEG. Why drive you me within? If this you do Be noble, why must darkness hide the deed? Why not destroy me out of hand? 

OR.                             Command not! Enter, and in the place where ye cut down My father, thou shalt yield thy life to me. 

AEG. Is there no help but this abode must see The past and future ills of Pelops' race? 

OR. Thine anyhow. That I can prophesy With perfect inspiration to thine ear. 

AEG. The skill you boast belonged not to your sire. 

OR. You question and delay. Go in! 

AEG.                               Lead on. 

OR. Nay, go thou first. 

AEG.                    That I may not escape thee? 

OR. No, that thou may'st not have thy wish in death. I may not stint one drop of bitterness. And would this doom were given without reprieve, If any try to act beyond the law, To kill them. Then the wicked would be few. 

LEADER OF CH. O seed of Atreus! how triumphantly Through grief and hardness thou hast freedom found, With full achievement in this onset crowned!
