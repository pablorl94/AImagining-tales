<ACTION>Alarums. Matthew Gough is slain, and all the rest.Then enter Jack Cade with his company.</ACTION> 

CADE So, sirs. Now go some and pull down the Savoy; others to th’ Inns of Court. Down with them all! 

DICK  I have a suit unto your Lordship. 

CADE Be it a lordship, thou shalt have it for that word. 

DICK  Only that the laws of England may come out of your mouth. 

HOLLAND ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Mass, ’twill be sore law, then, for he was thrust in the mouth with a spear, and ’tis not whole yet. 

SMITH ,  <ACTION>aside  </ACTION> Nay, John, it will be stinking law, for	 his breath stinks with eating toasted cheese. 

CADE I have thought upon it; it shall be so. Away! Burn all the records of the realm. My mouth shall be the Parliament of England. 

HOLLAND ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Then we are like to have biting	 statutes—unless his teeth be pulled out. 

CADE   And henceforward all things shall be in common. 

<ACTION>Enter a Messenger.</ACTION> 

MESSENGER My lord, a prize, a prize! Here’s the Lord Saye, which sold the towns in France, he that	 made us pay one-and-twenty fifteens, and one shilling to the pound, the last subsidy. 

<ACTION>Enter George with the Lord Saye.</ACTION> 

CADE  Well, he shall be beheaded for it ten times.—Ah, thou say, thou serge, nay, thou buckram lord, now art thou within point-blank of our jurisdiction	 regal. What canst thou answer to my Majesty for giving up of Normandy unto Monsieur Basimecu, the Dauphin of France? Be it known unto thee by these presence, even the presence of Lord Mortimer, that I am the besom that must sweep the	 court clean of such filth as thou art. Thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a grammar school; and whereas, before, our forefathers had no other books but the score and the tally, thou hast caused printing to be	 used, and, contrary to the King his crown and dignity, thou hast built a paper mill. It will be proved to thy face that thou hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and a verb and such abominable words as no Christian ear can endure to hear. Thou hast appointed justices of peace to call poor men before them about matters they were not able to answer. Moreover, thou hast put them in prison; and, because they could not read, thou hast hanged them, when indeed only for that cause	 they have been most worthy to live. 

Thou dost ride on a footcloth, dost thou not?

SAYE  What of that? 

CADE  Marry, thou oughtst not to let thy horse wear a cloak when honester men than thou go in their	 hose and doublets. 

DICK  And work in their shirt too—as myself, for example, that am a butcher. 

SAYE You men of Kent— 

DICK What say you of Kent?	 

SAYE   Nothing but this: ’tis bona terra, mala gens. 

CADE Away with him, away with him! He speaks Latin. 

SAYE Hear me but speak, and bear me where you will. Kent, in the commentaries Caesar writ,	 Is termed the civil’st place of all this isle. Sweet is the country, because full of riches; The people liberal, valiant, active, wealthy; Which makes me hope you are not void of pity. I sold not Maine; I lost not Normandy;	 Yet to recover them would lose my life. Justice with favor have I always done; Prayers and tears have moved me; gifts could never. When have I aught exacted at your hands Kent to maintain, the King, the realm, and you?	 Large gifts have I bestowed on learnèd clerks, Because my book preferred me to the King. And seeing ignorance is the curse of God, Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven, Unless you be possessed with devilish spirits,	 You cannot but forbear to murder me. This tongue hath parleyed unto foreign kings For your behoof— 

CADE Tut, when struck’st thou one blow in the field? 

SAYE Great men have reaching hands. Oft have I struck	 Those that I never saw, and struck them dead. 

GEORGE O monstrous coward! What, to come behind folks? 

SAYE These cheeks are pale for watching for your good. 

CADE  Give him a box o’ th’ ear, and that will make ’em red again. 

SAYE Long sitting to determine poor men’s causes Hath made me full of sickness and diseases. 

CADE You shall have a hempen caudle, then, and the help of hatchet.	 

DICK Why dost thou quiver, man? 

SAYE The palsy, and not fear, provokes me. 

CADE  Nay, he nods at us, as who should say “I’ll be even with you.” I’ll see if his head will stand steadier on a pole, or no. Take him away, and behead	 him. 

SAYE Tell me, wherein have I offended most? Have I affected wealth or honor? Speak. Are my chests filled up with extorted gold? Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?	 Whom have I injured, that you seek my death? These hands are free from guiltless blood-shedding, This breast from harboring foul deceitful thoughts. O, let me live! 

CADE  I feel remorse in myself with his words, but I’ll	 bridle it. He shall die, an it be but for pleading so well for his life. Away with him! He has a familiar under his tongue; he speaks not i’ God’s name. Go, take him away, I say, and strike off his head presently; and then break into his son-in-law’s	 house, Sir James Cromer, and strike off his head; and bring them both upon two poles hither. 

ALL  It shall be done. 

SAYE Ah, countrymen, if when you make your prayers, God should be so obdurate as yourselves,	 How would it fare with your departed souls? And therefore yet relent, and save my life. 

CADE  Away with him, and do as I command you. 

<ACTION>Some exit with Lord Saye.</ACTION> 

The proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a head on his shoulders unless he pay me tribute.	120 There shall not a maid be married but she shall pay to me her maidenhead ere they have it. Men shall hold of me in capite; and we charge and command that their wives be as free as heart can wish or tongue can tell.	 

DICK My lord, when shall we go to Cheapside and take up commodities upon our bills? 

CADE Marry, presently. 

ALL O, brave! 

<ACTION>Enter one with the heads of Lord Saye and Sir JamesCromer on poles.</ACTION> 

CADE But is not this braver? Let them kiss one another, for they loved well when they were alive. The heads are brought together. Now part them again, lest they consult about the giving up of some more towns in France. Soldiers, defer the spoil of the city until night, for, with these borne before us	 instead of maces, will we ride through the streets and at every corner have them kiss. Away! 

<ACTION>He exits with his company</ACTION>
