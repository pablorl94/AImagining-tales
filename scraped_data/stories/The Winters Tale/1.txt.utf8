<ACTION>Enter Leontes, Hermione, Mamillius, Polixenes, Camillo,and Attendants.</ACTION> 

POLIXENES Nine changes of the wat’ry star hath been The shepherd’s note since we have left our throne Without a burden. Time as long again Would be filled up, my brother, with our thanks, And yet we should for perpetuity Go hence in debt. And therefore, like a cipher, Yet standing in rich place, I multiply With one “We thank you” many thousands more That go before it. 

LEONTES Stay your thanks awhile,	 And pay them when you part. 

POLIXENES Sir, that’s tomorrow. I am questioned by my fears of what may chance Or breed upon our absence, that may blow No sneaping winds at home to make us say	 “This is put forth too truly.” Besides, I have stayed To tire your Royalty. 

LEONTES We are tougher, brother, Than you can put us to ’t. 

POLIXENES No longer stay.	 

LEONTES One sev’nnight longer. 

POLIXENES Very sooth, tomorrow. 

LEONTES We’ll part the time between ’s, then, and in that I’ll no gainsaying. 

POLIXENES Press me not, beseech you, so.	 There is no tongue that moves, none, none i’ th’ world, So soon as yours could win me. So it should now, Were there necessity in your request, although ’Twere needful I denied it. My affairs	 Do even drag me homeward, which to hinder Were in your love a whip to me, my stay To you a charge and trouble. To save both, Farewell, our brother. 

LEONTES  Tongue-tied, our queen?	 Speak you. 

HERMIONE I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until You had drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir, Charge him too coldly. Tell him you are sure All in Bohemia’s well. This satisfaction	 The bygone day proclaimed. Say this to him, He’s beat from his best ward. 

LEONTES Well said, Hermione. 

HERMIONE To tell he longs to see his son were strong. But let him say so then, and let him go.	 But let him swear so and he shall not stay; We’ll thwack him hence with distaffs. <ACTION>To Polixenes. </ACTION> Yet of your royal presence I’ll adventure The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia	 You take my lord, I’ll give him my commission To let him there a month behind the gest Prefixed for ’s parting.—Yet, good deed, Leontes, I love thee not a jar o’ th’ clock behind What lady she her lord.—You’ll stay?	 

POLIXENES   No, madam. 

HERMIONE Nay, but you will? 

POLIXENES I may not, verily. 

HERMIONE  Verily? You put me off with limber vows. But I,	 Though you would seek t’ unsphere the stars with oaths, Should yet say “Sir, no going.” Verily, You shall not go. A lady’s “verily” is As potent as a lord’s. Will you go yet?	 Force me to keep you as a prisoner, Not like a guest, so you shall pay your fees When you depart and save your thanks. How say you? My prisoner or my guest? By your dread “verily,” One of them you shall be.	 

POLIXENES  Your guest, then, madam. To be your prisoner should import offending, Which is for me less easy to commit Than you to punish. 

HERMIONE Not your jailer, then,	 But your kind hostess. Come, I’ll question you Of my lord’s tricks and yours when you were boys. You were pretty lordings then? 

POLIXENES We were, fair queen, Two lads that thought there was no more behind	 But such a day tomorrow as today, And to be boy eternal. 

HERMIONE  Was not my lord The verier wag o’ th’ two? 

POLIXENES We were as twinned lambs that did frisk i’ th’ sun And bleat the one at th’ other. What we changed Was innocence for innocence. We knew not The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dreamed That any did. Had we pursued that life, And our weak spirits ne’er been higher reared	 With stronger blood, we should have answered heaven Boldly “Not guilty,” the imposition cleared Hereditary ours. 

HERMIONE By this we gather	 You have tripped since. 

POLIXENES O my most sacred lady, Temptations have since then been born to ’s, for In those unfledged days was my wife a girl; Your precious self had then not crossed the eyes	 Of my young playfellow. 

HERMIONE Grace to boot! Of this make no conclusion, lest you say Your queen and I are devils. Yet go on. Th’ offenses we have made you do we’ll answer,	 If you first sinned with us, and that with us You did continue fault, and that you slipped not With any but with us. 

LEONTES Is he won yet? 

HERMIONE He’ll stay, my lord.	 

LEONTES At my request he would not. Hermione, my dearest, thou never spok’st To better purpose. 

HERMIONE Never? 

LEONTES  Never but once.	 

HERMIONE What, have I twice said well? When was ’t before? I prithee tell me. Cram ’s with praise, and make ’s As fat as tame things. One good deed dying tongueless Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.	 Our praises are our wages. You may ride ’s With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere With spur we heat an acre. But to th’ goal: My last good deed was to entreat his stay. What was my first? It has an elder sister,	 Or I mistake you. O, would her name were Grace! But once before I spoke to th’ purpose? When? Nay, let me have ’t; I long. 

LEONTES Why, that was when Three crabbèd months had soured themselves to	 death Ere I could make thee open thy white hand And clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter “I am yours forever.” 

HERMIONE ’Tis grace indeed.	 Why, lo you now, I have spoke to th’ purpose twice. The one forever earned a royal husband, Th’ other for some while a friend. She gives Polixenes her hand. LEONTES, aside  Too hot, too hot! To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.	 I have tremor cordis on me. My heart dances, But not for joy, not joy. This entertainment May a free face put on, derive a liberty From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom, And well become the agent. ’T may, I grant.	 But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers, As now they are, and making practiced smiles As in a looking glass, and then to sigh, as ’twere The mort o’ th’ deer—O, that is entertainment My bosom likes not, nor my brows.—Mamillius,	 Art thou my boy? 

MAMILLIUS  Ay, my good lord. 

LEONTES I’ fecks! Why, that’s my bawcock. What, hast smutched thy nose?	 They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain, We must be neat—not neat, but cleanly, captain. And yet the steer, the heifer, and the calf Are all called neat.—Still virginalling Upon his palm?—How now, you wanton calf?	 Art thou my calf? 

MAMILLIUS   Yes, if you will, my lord. 

LEONTES Thou want’st a rough pash and the shoots that I have To be full like me; yet they say we are	 Almost as like as eggs. Women say so, That will say anything. But were they false As o’erdyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false As dice are to be wished by one that fixes No bourn ’twixt his and mine, yet were it true	 To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page, Look on me with your welkin eye. Sweet villain, Most dear’st, my collop! Can thy dam?—may ’t be?— Affection, thy intention stabs the center.	 Thou dost make possible things not so held, Communicat’st with dreams—how can this be? With what’s unreal thou coactive art, And fellow’st nothing. Then ’tis very credent Thou may’st co-join with something; and thou dost,	 And that beyond commission, and I find it, And that to the infection of my brains And hard’ning of my brows. 

POLIXENES  What means Sicilia? 

HERMIONE He something seems unsettled.	 

POLIXENES How, my lord? 

LEONTES What cheer? How is ’t with you, best brother? 

HERMIONE You look As if you held a brow of much distraction. Are you moved, my lord?	 

LEONTES No, in good earnest. How sometimes nature will betray its folly, Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines Of my boy’s face, methoughts I did recoil	 Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreeched, In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled Lest it should bite its master and so prove, As ornaments oft do, too dangerous. How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,	 This squash, this gentleman.—Mine honest friend, Will you take eggs for money? 

MAMILLIUS No, my lord, I’ll fight. 

LEONTES You will? Why, happy man be ’s dole!—My brother, Are you so fond of your young prince as we Do seem to be of ours? 

POLIXENES If at home, sir, He’s all my exercise, my mirth, my matter, Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy, My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all.	 He makes a July’s day short as December, And with his varying childness cures in me Thoughts that would thick my blood. 

LEONTES  So stands this squire	 Officed with me. We two will walk, my lord, And leave you to your graver steps.—Hermione, How thou lov’st us show in our brother’s welcome. Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap. Next to thyself and my young rover, he’s Apparent to my heart. 

HERMIONE If you would seek us, We are yours i’ th’ garden. Shall ’s attend you there? 

LEONTES To your own bents dispose you. You’ll be found, Be you beneath the sky. Aside. I am angling now,	 Though you perceive me not how I give line. Go to, go to! How she holds up the neb, the bill to him, And arms her with the boldness of a wife To her allowing husband!	 

<ACTION>Exit Hermione, Polixenes, and Attendants.</ACTION> 

Gone already. Inch thick, knee-deep, o’er head and ears a forked one!— Go play, boy, play. Thy mother plays, and I Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue	 Will hiss me to my grave. Contempt and clamor Will be my knell. Go play, boy, play.—There have been, Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now; And many a man there is, even at this present,	 Now while I speak this, holds his wife by th’ arm, That little thinks she has been sluiced in ’s absence, And his pond fished by his next neighbor, by Sir Smile, his neighbor. Nay, there’s comfort in ’t Whiles other men have gates and those gates	 opened, As mine, against their will. Should all despair That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind Would hang themselves. Physic for ’t there’s none. It is a bawdy planet, that will strike	 Where ’tis predominant; and ’tis powerful, think it, From east, west, north, and south. Be it concluded, No barricado for a belly. Know ’t, It will let in and out the enemy With bag and baggage. 

Many thousand on ’s	 Have the disease and feel ’t not.—How now, boy?

MAMILLIUS I am like you, they say. 

LEONTES  Why, that’s some comfort.— What, Camillo there? 

CAMILLO ,  <ACTION>coming forward</ACTION> Ay, my good lord.	 

LEONTES Go play, Mamillius. Thou ’rt an honest man. 

<ACTION>Mamillius exits.</ACTION> 

Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer. 

CAMILLO You had much ado to make his anchor hold. When you cast out, it still came home. 

LEONTES Didst note it?	 

CAMILLO He would not stay at your petitions, made His business more material. 

LEONTES Didst perceive it? <ACTION>Aside</ACTION> . They’re here with me already, whisp’ring, rounding:	 “Sicilia is a so-forth.” ’Tis far gone When I shall gust it last.—How came ’t, Camillo, That he did stay? 

CAMILLO  At the good queen’s entreaty. 

LEONTES “At the queen’s” be ’t. “Good” should be pertinent,	 But so it is, it is not. Was this taken By any understanding pate but thine? For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in More than the common blocks. Not noted, is ’t, But of the finer natures, by some severals	 Of headpiece extraordinary? Lower messes Perchance are to this business purblind? Say. 

CAMILLO Business, my lord? I think most understand Bohemia stays here longer. 

LEONTES Ha?	 

CAMILLO Stays here longer. 

LEONTES  Ay, but why? 

CAMILLO To satisfy your Highness and the entreaties Of our most gracious mistress. 

LEONTES Satisfy?	 Th’ entreaties of your mistress? Satisfy? Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo, With all the nearest things to my heart, as well My chamber-counsels, wherein, priestlike, thou Hast cleansed my bosom; I from thee departed	 Thy penitent reformed. But we have been Deceived in thy integrity, deceived In that which seems so. 

CAMILLO  Be it forbid, my lord! 

LEONTES To bide upon ’t: thou art not honest; or,	 If thou inclin’st that way, thou art a coward, Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining From course required; or else thou must be counted A servant grafted in my serious trust	 And therein negligent; or else a fool That seest a game played home, the rich stake drawn, And tak’st it all for jest. 

CAMILLO My gracious lord, I may be negligent, foolish, and fearful. In every one of these no man is free, But that his negligence, his folly, fear, Among the infinite doings of the world, Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord, If ever I were willful-negligent, It was my folly; if industriously I played the fool, it was my negligence, Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful To do a thing where I the issue doubted, Whereof the execution did cry out Against the non-performance, ’twas a fear Which oft infects the wisest. These, my lord, Are such allowed infirmities that honesty Is never free of. But, beseech your Grace,	 Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass By its own visage. If I then deny it, ’Tis none of mine. 

LEONTES Ha’ not you seen, Camillo— But that’s past doubt; you have, or your eyeglass	 Is thicker than a cuckold’s horn—or heard— For to a vision so apparent, rumor Cannot be mute—or thought—for cogitation Resides not in that man that does not think— My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess—	 Or else be impudently negative To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought—then say My wife’s a hobby-horse, deserves a name As rank as any flax-wench that puts to Before her troth-plight. Say ’t, and justify ’t.	 

CAMILLO I would not be a stander-by to hear My sovereign mistress clouded so without My present vengeance taken. ’Shrew my heart, You never spoke what did become you less Than this, which to reiterate were sin	 As deep as that, though true. 

LEONTES Is whispering nothing? Is leaning cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses? Kissing with inside lip? Stopping the career Of laughter with a sigh?—a note infallible	 Of breaking honesty. Horsing foot on foot? Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks more swift? Hours minutes? Noon midnight? And all eyes Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only, That would unseen be wicked? Is this nothing?	 Why, then the world and all that’s in ’t is nothing, The covering sky is nothing, Bohemia nothing, My wife is nothing, nor nothing have these nothings, If this be nothing. 

CAMILLO Good my lord, be cured	 Of this diseased opinion, and betimes, For ’tis most dangerous. 

LEONTES Say it be, ’tis true. 

CAMILLO No, no, my lord. 

LEONTES It is. You lie, you lie.	 I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee, Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave, Or else a hovering temporizer that Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil, Inclining to them both. Were my wife’s liver Infected as her life, she would not live The running of one glass. 

CAMILLO Who does infect her? 

LEONTES Why, he that wears her like her medal, hanging About his neck—Bohemia, who, if I	 Had servants true about me, that bare eyes To see alike mine honor as their profits, Their own particular thrifts, they would do that Which should undo more doing. Ay, and thou, His cupbearer—whom I from meaner form	 Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see Plainly as heaven sees Earth and Earth sees heaven How I am galled—mightst bespice a cup To give mine enemy a lasting wink, Which draft to me were cordial.	 

CAMILLO Sir, my lord, I could do this, and that with no rash potion, But with a ling’ring dram that should not work Maliciously like poison. But I cannot Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,	 So sovereignly being honorable. I have loved thee— 

LEONTES Make that thy question, and go rot! Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled, To appoint myself in this vexation, sully The purity and whiteness of my sheets—	 Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps— Give scandal to the blood o’ th’ Prince, my son, Who I do think is mine and love as mine, Without ripe moving to ’t? Would I do this?	 Could man so blench? 

CAMILLO I must believe you, sir. I do, and will fetch off Bohemia for ’t— Provided that, when he’s removed, your Highness Will take again your queen as yours at first,	 Even for your son’s sake, and thereby for sealing The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms Known and allied to yours. 

LEONTES   Thou dost advise me Even so as I mine own course have set down.	 I’ll give no blemish to her honor, none. 

CAMILLO My lord, Go then, and with a countenance as clear As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia And with your queen. I am his cupbearer.	 If from me he have wholesome beverage, Account me not your servant. 

LEONTES This is all. Do ’t and thou hast the one half of my heart; Do ’t not, thou splitt’st thine own.	 

CAMILLO I’ll do ’t, my lord. 

LEONTES I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

CAMILLO O miserable lady! But, for me, What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner Of good Polixenes, and my ground to do ’t	 Is the obedience to a master, one Who in rebellion with himself will have All that are his so too. To do this deed, Promotion follows. If I could find example Of thousands that had struck anointed kings	 And flourished after, I’d not do ’t. But since Nor brass, nor stone, nor parchment bears not one, Let villainy itself forswear ’t. I must Forsake the court. To do ’t or no is certain To me a breakneck. Happy star reign now!	 Here comes Bohemia. 

<ACTION>Enter Polixenes.</ACTION> 

POLIXENES ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> This is strange. Methinks My favor here begins to warp. Not speak?— Good day, Camillo. 

CAMILLO Hail, most royal sir.	 

POLIXENES What is the news i’ th’ court? 

CAMILLO None rare, my lord. 

POLIXENES The King hath on him such a countenance As he had lost some province and a region Loved as he loves himself. Even now I met him	 With customary compliment, when he, Wafting his eyes to th’ contrary and falling A lip of much contempt, speeds from me, and So leaves me to consider what is breeding That changes thus his manners.	450 

CAMILLO I dare not know, my lord. 

POLIXENES How, dare not? Do not? Do you know and dare not? Be intelligent to me—’tis thereabouts; For to yourself what you do know, you must, And cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo, Your changed complexions are to me a mirror Which shows me mine changed too, for I must be A party in this alteration, finding Myself thus altered with ’t.	 

CAMILLO There is a sickness Which puts some of us in distemper, but I cannot name the disease, and it is caught Of you that yet are well. 

POLIXENES How caught of me?	 Make me not sighted like the basilisk. I have looked on thousands who have sped the better By my regard, but killed none so. Camillo, As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto	 Clerklike experienced, which no less adorns Our gentry than our parents’ noble names, In whose success we are gentle, I beseech you, If you know aught which does behoove my knowledge	 Thereof to be informed, imprison ’t not In ignorant concealment. 

CAMILLO I may not answer. 

POLIXENES A sickness caught of me, and yet I well? I must be answered. Dost thou hear, Camillo?	 I conjure thee by all the parts of man Which honor does acknowledge, whereof the least Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare What incidency thou dost guess of harm Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near; Which way to be prevented, if to be; If not, how best to bear it. 

CAMILLO Sir, I will tell you, Since I am charged in honor and by him That I think honorable. Therefore mark my counsel,	 Which must be e’en as swiftly followed as I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me Cry lost, and so goodnight. 

POLIXENES On, good Camillo. 

CAMILLO I am appointed him to murder you.	 

POLIXENES By whom, Camillo? 

CAMILLO By the King. 

POLIXENES For what? 

CAMILLO He thinks, nay with all confidence he swears, As he had seen ’t or been an instrument	 To vice you to ’t, that you have touched his queen Forbiddenly. 

POLIXENES O, then my best blood turn To an infected jelly, and my name Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!	 Turn then my freshest reputation to A savor that may strike the dullest nostril Where I arrive, and my approach be shunned, Nay, hated too, worse than the great’st infection That e’er was heard or read.	 

CAMILLO Swear his thought over By each particular star in heaven and By all their influences, you may as well Forbid the sea for to obey the moon As or by oath remove or counsel shake	 The fabric of his folly, whose foundation Is piled upon his faith and will continue The standing of his body. 

POLIXENES How should this grow? 

CAMILLO I know not. But I am sure ’tis safer to	520 Avoid what’s grown than question how ’tis born. If therefore you dare trust my honesty, That lies enclosèd in this trunk which you Shall bear along impawned, away tonight! Your followers I will whisper to the business,	 And will by twos and threes at several posterns Clear them o’ th’ city. For myself, I’ll put My fortunes to your service, which are here By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain, For, by the honor of my parents, I	 Have uttered truth—which if you seek to prove, I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer Than one condemned by the King’s own mouth, thereon His execution sworn.	 

POLIXENES  I do believe thee. I saw his heart in ’s face. Give me thy hand. Be pilot to me and thy places shall Still neighbor mine. My ships are ready and My people did expect my hence departure	 Two days ago. This jealousy Is for a precious creature. As she’s rare, Must it be great; and as his person’s mighty, Must it be violent; and as he does conceive He is dishonored by a man which ever	545 Professed to him, why, his revenges must In that be made more bitter. Fear o’ershades me. Good expedition be my friend, and comfort The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing Of his ill-ta’en suspicion. Come, Camillo,	 I will respect thee as a father if Thou bear’st my life off hence. Let us avoid. 

CAMILLO It is in mine authority to command The keys of all the posterns. Please your Highness To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.	 <ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
