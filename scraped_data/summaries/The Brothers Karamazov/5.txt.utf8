Fyodor, Ivan, Pyotr Miusov, and Miusov's distant relative Pyotr Fomich Kalganov arrive at the monastery, but there's no Dmitri in sight.

They are led to Zosima's hermitage by Maximov, a landowner who happens to be headed in the same direction. On the way, a monk intercepts them and invites them to dinner with the Father Superior later in the day.

The hermitage is surrounded by beautiful flowers. Outside, the faithful have gathered to wait for Zosima's blessing. A monk asks them to wait while he announces their arrival to Zosima.
