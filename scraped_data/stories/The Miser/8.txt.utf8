SCENE IX--HARPAGON, ÉLISE, VALÈRE. 

HAR. (_alone, at the farther end of the stage_). It is nothing, thank heaven! 

VAL. (_not seeing_ HARPAGON). In short, flight is the last resource we have left us to avoid all this; and if your love, dear Élise, is as strong as ... (_Seeing_ HARPAGON) Yes, a daughter is bound to obey her father. She has no right to inquire what a husband offered to her is like, and when the most important question, "without dowry," presents itself, she should accept anybody that is given her. 

HAR. Good; that was beautifully said! 

VAL. I beg your pardon, Sir, if I carry it a little too far, and take upon myself to speak to her as I do. 

HAR. Why, I am delighted, and I wish you to have her entirely under your control. (_To_ ÉLISE) Yes, you may run away as much as you like. I give him all the authority over you that heaven has given me, and I will have you do all that he tells you. 

VAL. After that, resist all my expostulations, if you can.
