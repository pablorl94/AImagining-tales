CHAMBERLAIN Because they speak no English, thus they prayed To tell your Grace: that, having heard by fame Of this so noble and so fair assembly This night to meet here, they could do no less, Out of the great respect they bear to beauty, But leave their flocks and, under your fair conduct,	 Crave leave to view these ladies and entreat An hour of revels with ’em. 

WOLSEY Say, Lord Chamberlain, They have done my poor house grace, for which I pay ’em A thousand thanks and pray ’em take their pleasures.

CHAMBERLAIN I will, my lord. 

<ACTION>Whisper with the masquers.</ACTION>

CHAMBERLAIN An ’t please your Grace, Sir Thomas Bullen’s daughter, The Viscount Rochford, one of her Highness’ women.
