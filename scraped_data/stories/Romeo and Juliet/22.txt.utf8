NURSE ,  <ACTION>approaching the bed</ACTION> Mistress! What, mistress! Juliet!—Fast, I warrant her, she— Why, lamb, why, lady! Fie, you slugabed! Why, love, I say! Madam! Sweetheart! Why, bride!— What, not a word?—You take your pennyworths	 now. Sleep for a week, for the next night, I warrant, The County Paris hath set up his rest That you shall rest but little.—God forgive me, Marry, and amen! How sound is she asleep!	 I needs must wake her.—Madam, madam, madam! Ay, let the County take you in your bed, He’ll fright you up, i’ faith.—Will it not be? <ACTION>She opens the bed’s curtains.</ACTION> What, dressed, and in your clothes, and down again?	 I must needs wake you. Lady, lady, lady!— Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady’s dead.— O, weraday, that ever I was born!— Some aqua vitae, ho!—My lord! My lady! 

<ACTION>Enter Lady Capulet.</ACTION> 

LADY CAPULET What noise is here?	 

NURSE O lamentable day! 

LADY CAPULET What is the matter? 

NURSE Look, look!—O heavy day! 

LADY CAPULET O me! O me! My child, my only life, Revive, look up, or I will die with thee.	 Help, help! Call help. 

<ACTION>Enter Capulet.</ACTION> 

CAPULET For shame, bring Juliet forth. Her lord is come. 

NURSE She’s dead, deceased. She’s dead, alack the day! 

LADY CAPULET Alack the day, she’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead. 

CAPULET Ha, let me see her! Out, alas, she’s cold.	 Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff. Life and these lips have long been separated. Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field. 

NURSE O lamentable day!	 

LADY CAPULET  O woeful time! 

CAPULET Death, that hath ta’en her hence to make me wail, Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak. 

<ACTION>Enter Friar Lawrence and the County Paris, withMusicians.</ACTION> 

FRIAR LAWRENCE Come, is the bride ready to go to church? 

CAPULET Ready to go, but never to return.—	 O son, the night before thy wedding day Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies, Flower as she was, deflowerèd by him. Death is my son-in-law; Death is my heir. My daughter he hath wedded. I will die	 And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death’s. 

PARIS Have I thought long to see this morning’s face, And doth it give me such a sight as this? 

LADY CAPULET Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day! Most miserable hour that e’er time saw	 In lasting labor of his pilgrimage! But one, poor one, one poor and loving child, But one thing to rejoice and solace in, And cruel death hath catched it from my sight! 

NURSE O woe, O woeful, woeful, woeful day!	 Most lamentable day, most woeful day That ever, ever I did yet behold! O day, O day, O day, O hateful day! Never was seen so black a day as this! O woeful day, O woeful day!	 

PARIS Beguiled, divorcèd, wrongèd, spited, slain! Most detestable death, by thee beguiled, By cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown! O love! O life! Not life, but love in death! 

CAPULET Despised, distressèd, hated, martyred, killed!	 Uncomfortable time, why cam’st thou now To murder, murder our solemnity? O child! O child! My soul and not my child! Dead art thou! Alack, my child is dead, And with my child my joys are burièd.	 

FRIAR LAWRENCE Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion’s cure lives not In these confusions. Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid. Now heaven hath all, And all the better is it for the maid. Your part in her you could not keep from death,	 But heaven keeps his part in eternal life. The most you sought was her promotion, For ’twas your heaven she should be advanced; And weep you now, seeing she is advanced Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?	 O, in this love you love your child so ill That you run mad, seeing that she is well. She’s not well married that lives married long, But she’s best married that dies married young. Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary	 On this fair corse, and, as the custom is, And in her best array, bear her to church, For though fond nature bids us all lament, Yet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment. 

CAPULET All things that we ordainèd festival	 Turn from their office to black funeral: Our instruments to melancholy bells, Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast, Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change, Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,	 And all things change them to the contrary. 

FRIAR LAWRENCE Sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him, And go, Sir Paris. Everyone prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave. The heavens do lour upon you for some ill.	 Move them no more by crossing their high will. 

<ACTION>All but the Nurse and the Musicians exit.</ACTION> 

FIRST MUSICIAN Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone. 

NURSE Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up, For, well you know, this is a pitiful case. 

FIRST MUSICIAN Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.	 

<ACTION>Nurse exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Peter.</ACTION> 

PETER Musicians, O musicians, “Heart’s ease,” “Heart’s ease.” O, an you will have me live, play “Heart’s ease.” 

FIRST MUSICIAN Why “Heart’s ease?” 

PETER O musicians, because my heart itself plays “My	 heart is full.” O, play me some merry dump to comfort me. 

FIRST MUSICIAN Not a dump, we. ’Tis no time to play now. 

PETER You will not then?	 

FIRST MUSICIAN  No. 

PETER I will then give it you soundly. 

FIRST MUSICIAN What will you give us? 

PETER No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give you the minstrel.	 

FIRST MUSICIAN Then will I give you the serving-creature. 

PETER  Then will I lay the serving-creature’s dagger on your pate. I will carry no crochets. I’ll re you, I’ll fa you. Do you note me?	 

FIRST MUSICIAN An you re us and fa us, you note us. 

SECOND MUSICIAN Pray you, put up your dagger and put out your wit. 

PETER Then have at you with my wit. I will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger.	 Answer me like men. <ACTION>Sings.	</ACTION> When griping griefs the heart doth wound And doleful dumps the mind oppress, Then music with her silver sound— Why “silver sound”? Why “music with her silver	 sound”? What say you, Simon Catling? 

FIRST MUSICIAN  Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound. 

PETER  Prates.—What say you, Hugh Rebeck? 

SECOND MUSICIAN I say “silver sound” because musicians	 sound for silver. 

PETER Prates too.—What say you, James Soundpost? 

THIRD MUSICIAN  Faith, I know not what to say. 

PETER O, I cry you mercy. You are the singer. I will say for you. It is “music with her silver sound” because	 musicians have no gold for sounding: <ACTION>Sings.	</ACTION> Then music with her silver sound With speedy help doth lend redress. <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

FIRST MUSICIAN  What a pestilent knave is this same! 

SECOND MUSICIAN  Hang him, Jack. Come, we’ll in	 here, tarry for the mourners, and stay dinner. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
