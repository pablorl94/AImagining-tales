<ACTION>Enter Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo.</ACTION> 

STEPHANO , <ACTION> to Trinculo </ACTION> Tell not me. When the butt is out, we will drink water; not a drop before. Therefore bear up and board ’em.—Servant monster, drink to me. 

TRINCULO Servant monster? The folly of this island!	 They say there’s but five upon this isle; we are three of them. If th’ other two be brained like us, the state totters. 

STEPHANO Drink, servant monster, when I bid thee. Thy eyes are almost set in thy head.	 

<ACTION>Caliban drinks.</ACTION> 

TRINCULO Where should they be set else? He were a brave monster indeed if they were set in his tail. 

STEPHANO My man-monster hath drowned his tongue in sack. For my part, the sea cannot drown me. I swam, ere I could recover the shore, five-and-thirty	 leagues off and on, by this light.—Thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my standard. 

TRINCULO Your lieutenant, if you list. He’s no standard. 

STEPHANO  We’ll not run, Monsieur Monster.	 

TRINCULO Nor go neither. But you’ll lie like dogs, and yet say nothing neither. 

STEPHANO Mooncalf, speak once in thy life, if thou be’st a good mooncalf. 

CALIBAN How does thy Honor? Let me lick thy shoe. I’ll	 not serve him; he is not valiant. 

TRINCULO  Thou liest, most ignorant monster. I am in case to justle a constable. Why, thou debauched fish, thou! Was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I today? Wilt thou tell a	 monstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a monster? 

CALIBAN  Lo, how he mocks me! Wilt thou let him, my lord? 

TRINCULO “Lord,” quoth he? That a monster should be	 such a natural! 

CALIBAN Lo, lo again! Bite him to death, I prithee. 

STEPHANO Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head. If you prove a mutineer, the next tree. The poor monster’s my subject, and he shall not suffer	 indignity. 

CALIBAN I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to harken once again to the suit I made to thee? 

STEPHANO Marry, will I. Kneel and repeat it. I will stand, and so shall Trinculo.	 

<ACTION>Enter Ariel, invisible.</ACTION> 

CALIBAN ,  <ACTION>kneeling </ACTION> As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island. 

ARIEL ,  <ACTION>in Trinculo’s voice</ACTION> Thou liest. 

CALIBAN ,  <ACTION>to Trinculo</ACTION> Thou liest, thou jesting monkey,	 thou. He stands. I would my valiant master would destroy thee. I do not lie. 

STEPHANO Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in ’s tale, by this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.	 

TRINCULO Why, I said nothing. 

STEPHANO Mum then, and no more.  <ACTION>Trinculo standsaside.</ACTION> Proceed. 

CALIBAN I say by sorcery he got this isle; From me he got it. If thy Greatness will,	 Revenge it on him, for I know thou dar’st, But this thing dare not. 

STEPHANO  That’s most certain. 

CALIBAN Thou shalt be lord of it, and I’ll serve thee. 

STEPHANO How now shall this be compassed? Canst	 thou bring me to the party? 

CALIBAN Yea, yea, my lord. I’ll yield him thee asleep, Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head. 

ARIEL ,  <ACTION>in Trinculo’s voice</ACTION> Thou liest. Thou canst not. 

CALIBAN What a pied ninny’s this!—Thou scurvy patch!—	 I do beseech thy Greatness, give him blows And take his bottle from him. When that’s gone, He shall drink naught but brine, for I’ll not show him Where the quick freshes are. 

STEPHANO Trinculo, run into no further danger. Interrupt	 the monster one word further, and by this hand, I’ll turn my mercy out o’ doors and make a stockfish of thee. 

TRINCULO Why, what did I? I did nothing. I’ll go farther off.	 

STEPHANO Didst thou not say he lied? 

ARIEL ,  <ACTION>in Trinculo’s voice</ACTION> Thou liest. 

STEPHANO Do I so? Take thou that.	 <ACTION>He beats Trinculo.</ACTION> As you like this, give me the lie another time. 

TRINCULO I did not give the lie! Out o’ your wits and	 hearing too? A pox o’ your bottle! This can sack and drinking do. A murrain on your monster, and the devil take your fingers! 

CALIBAN  Ha, ha, ha! 

STEPHANO  Now forward with your tale.  <ACTION>To Trinculo.	</ACTION> Prithee, stand further off. 

CALIBAN Beat him enough. After a little time I’ll beat him too. 

STEPHANO Stand farther.  <ACTION>Trinculo moves fartheraway.</ACTION> Come, proceed.	 

CALIBAN Why, as I told thee, ’tis a custom with him I’ th’ afternoon to sleep. There thou mayst brain him, Having first seized his books, or with a log Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake, Or cut his weasand with thy knife. Remember	 First to possess his books, for without them He’s but a sot, as I am, nor hath not One spirit to command. They all do hate him As rootedly as I. Burn but his books. He has brave utensils—for so he calls them—	 Which, when he has a house, he’ll deck withal. And that most deeply to consider is The beauty of his daughter. He himself Calls her a nonpareil. I never saw a woman But only Sycorax my dam and she;	 But she as far surpasseth Sycorax As great’st does least. 

STEPHANO Is it so brave a lass? 

CALIBAN Ay, lord, she will become thy bed, I warrant, And bring thee forth brave brood.	 

STEPHANO Monster, I will kill this man. His daughter and I will be king and queen—save our Graces!— and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys.—Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo? 

TRINCULO Excellent.	 

STEPHANO Give me thy hand. I am sorry I beat thee. But while thou liv’st, keep a good tongue in thy head. 

CALIBAN Within this half hour will he be asleep. Wilt thou destroy him then?	 

STEPHANO Ay, on mine honor. 

ARIEL ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> This will I tell my master. 

CALIBAN Thou mak’st me merry. I am full of pleasure. Let us be jocund. Will you troll the catch You taught me but whilere?	 

STEPHANO At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any reason.—Come on, Trinculo, let us sing. <ACTION>Sings.</ACTION> "Flout ’em and cout ’em And scout ’em and flout ’em! Thought is free."  

CALIBAN That’s not the tune. 

<ACTION>Ariel plays the tune on a tabor and pipe.</ACTION> 

STEPHANO  What is this same? 

TRINCULO This is the tune of our catch played by the picture of Nobody. 

STEPHANO ,  <ACTION>to the invisible musician </ACTION> If thou be’st a	 man, show thyself in thy likeness. If thou be’st a devil, take ’t as thou list. 

TRINCULO O, forgive me my sins! 

STEPHANO He that dies pays all debts.—I defy thee!— Mercy upon us!	 

CALIBAN Art thou afeard? 

STEPHANO No, monster, not I. 

CALIBAN Be not afeard. The isle is full of noises, Sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not. Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments	 Will hum about mine ears, and sometimes voices That, if I then had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again; and then, in dreaming, The clouds methought would open, and show riches Ready to drop upon me, that when I waked	 I cried to dream again. 

STEPHANO  This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall have my music for nothing. 

CALIBAN  When Prospero is destroyed. 

STEPHANO That shall be by and by. I remember the	 story. 

TRINCULO The sound is going away. Let’s follow it, and after do our work. 

STEPHANO  Lead, monster. We’ll follow.—I would I could see this taborer. He lays it on. Wilt come?	 

TRINCULO I’ll follow, Stephano. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
