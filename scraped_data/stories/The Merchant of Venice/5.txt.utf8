<ACTION>Enter Jessica and Lancelet Gobbo.</ACTION> 

JESSICA I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so. Our house is hell and thou, a merry devil, Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness. But fare thee well. There is a ducat for thee, And, Lancelet, soon at supper shalt thou see	 Lorenzo, who is thy new master’s guest. Give him this letter, do it secretly, And so farewell. I would not have my father See me in talk with thee. 

LANCELET Adieu. Tears exhibit my tongue, most beautiful	 pagan, most sweet Jew. If a Christian do not play the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But adieu. These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit. Adieu. 

JESSICA Farewell, good Lancelet.	 

<ACTION>Lancelet exits.</ACTION> 

Alack, what heinous sin is it in me To be ashamed to be my father’s child? But though I am a daughter to his blood, I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo, If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,	 Become a Christian and thy loving wife.
