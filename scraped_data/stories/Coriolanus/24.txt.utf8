<ACTION>Enter Menenius to the Watch, or Guard.</ACTION> 

FIRST WATCH  Stay! Whence are you? 

SECOND WATCH Stand, and go back. 

MENENIUS You guard like men; ’tis well. But by your leave, I am an officer of state and come To speak with Coriolanus.	 

FIRST WATCH From whence? 

MENENIUS From Rome. 

FIRST WATCH You may not pass; you must return. Our general Will no more hear from thence. 

SECOND WATCH You’ll see your Rome embraced with fire before	 You’ll speak with Coriolanus. 

MENENIUS Good my friends, If you have heard your general talk of Rome And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks My name hath touched your ears. It is Menenius.	 

FIRST WATCH Be it so; go back. The virtue of your name Is not here passable. 

MENENIUS I tell thee, fellow, Thy general is my lover. I have been The book of his good acts, whence men have read	 His fame unparalleled happily amplified; For I have ever verified my friends— Of whom he’s chief—with all the size that verity Would without lapsing suffer. Nay, sometimes, Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,	 I have tumbled past the throw, and in his praise Have almost stamped the leasing. Therefore, fellow, I must have leave to pass. 

FIRST WATCH  Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own,	 you should not pass here, no, though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back. 

MENENIUS Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius, always factionary on the party of your general.	 

SECOND WATCH Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you have, I am one that, telling true under him, must say you cannot pass. Therefore, go back. 

MENENIUS Has he dined, can’st thou tell? For I would not speak with him till after dinner.	 

FIRST WATCH You are a Roman, are you? 

MENENIUS I am, as thy general is. 

FIRST WATCH Then you should hate Rome as he does. Can you, when you have pushed out your gates the very defender of them, and, in a violent popular	 ignorance given your enemy your shield, think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as you seem to be? Can you think to blow	 out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in with such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived. Therefore, back to Rome and prepare for your execution. You are condemned. Our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon.	 

MENENIUS Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would use me with estimation. 

FIRST WATCH  Come, my captain knows you not. 

MENENIUS I mean thy general. 

FIRST WATCH My general cares not for you. Back, I say,	 go, lest I let forth your half pint of blood. Back! That’s the utmost of your having. Back! 

MENENIUS Nay, but fellow, fellow— 

<ACTION>Enter Coriolanus with Aufidius.</ACTION> 

CORIOLANUS What’s the matter? 

MENENIUS <ACTION>to First Watch </ACTION> Now, you companion, I’ll	 say an errand for you. You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from my son Coriolanus. Guess but by my entertainment with him if thou stand’st not i’ th’ state of hanging or of some	 death more long in spectatorship and crueler in suffering; behold now presently, and swoon for what’s to come upon thee.  <ACTION>(To Coriolanus.) </ACTION> The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old	 father Menenius does! O my son, my son! (He weeps.) Thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here’s water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to thee; but being assured none but myself could move thee, I have been blown out of your	 gates with sighs, and conjure thee to pardon Rome and thy petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here, this, who, like a block, hath denied my access to thee. 

CORIOLANUS Away! 

MENENIUS How? Away? 

CORIOLANUS Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs Are servanted to others. Though I owe My revenge properly, my remission lies	 In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar, Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather Than pity note how much. Therefore, begone. Mine ears against your suits are stronger than Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,	 Take this along; I writ it for thy sake, 

<ACTION>He gives Menenius a paper.</ACTION> 

And would have sent it. Another word, Menenius, I will not hear thee speak.—This man, Aufidius, Was my beloved in Rome; yet thou behold’st. 

AUFIDIUS You keep a constant temper.	 

<ACTION>They exit. </ACTION> 

<ACTION>The Guard and Menenius remain.</ACTION> 

FIRST WATCH Now, sir, is your name Menenius? 

SECOND WATCH  ’Tis a spell, you see, of much power. You know the way home again. 

FIRST WATCH Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your Greatness back?	 

SECOND WATCH What cause do you think I have to swoon? 

MENENIUS I neither care for th’ world nor your general. For such things as you, I can scarce think there’s any, you’re so slight. He that hath a will to	 die by himself fears it not from another. Let your general do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and your misery increase with your age! I say to you, as I was said to, away!	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

FIRST WATCH  A noble fellow, I warrant him.	 

SECOND WATCH The worthy fellow is our general. He’s the rock, the oak not to be wind-shaken. 

<ACTION>Watch exit.</ACTION>
