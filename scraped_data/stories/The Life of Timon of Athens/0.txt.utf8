<ACTION>Enter Poet, Painter, Jeweler, and Merchant, at severaldoors.</ACTION> 

POET Good day, sir. 

PAINTER I am glad you’re well. 

POET I have not seen you long. How goes the world? 

PAINTER It wears, sir, as it grows. POET  Ay, that’s well known. But what particular rarity, what strange, Which manifold record not matches? See, Magic of bounty, all these spirits thy power Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant. 

PAINTER I know them both. Th’ other’s a jeweler.	 

MERCHANT , <ACTION> to Jeweler</ACTION> O, ’tis a worthy lord! 

JEWELER Nay, that’s most fixed. 

MERCHANT A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were, To an untirable and continuate goodness. 

<ACTION>He passes. </ACTION> 

JEWELER I have a jewel here—  

MERCHANT O, pray, let’s see ’t. For the Lord Timon, sir? 

JEWELER If he will touch the estimate. But for that— 

POET ,  <ACTION>to Painter</ACTION> When we for recompense have praised the vile, It stains the glory in that happy verse	 Which aptly sings the good. 

MERCHANT ,  <ACTION>looking at the jewel</ACTION> ’Tis a good form. 

JEWELER And rich. Here is a water, look ye. 

PAINTER ,  <ACTION>to Poet</ACTION> You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication To the great lord.	 

POET A thing slipped idly from me. Our poesy is as a gum which oozes From whence ’tis nourished. The fire i’ th’ flint Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame Provokes itself and, like the current, flies	 Each bound it chases. What have you there? 

PAINTER A picture, sir. When comes your book forth? 

POET Upon the heels of my presentment, sir. Let’s see your piece. 

PAINTER  ’Tis a good piece.	 

POET So ’tis. This comes off well and excellent. 

PAINTER Indifferent. 

POET Admirable! How this grace Speaks his own standing! What a mental power This eye shoots forth! How big imagination	 Moves in this lip! To th’ dumbness of the gesture One might interpret. 

PAINTER It is a pretty mocking of the life. Here is a touch. Is ’t good? 

POET I will say of it,	 It tutors nature. Artificial strife Lives in these touches livelier than life. 

<ACTION>Enter certain Senators.</ACTION> 

PAINTER How this lord is followed. 

POET The senators of Athens, happy men. 

PAINTER Look, more.	 

POET You see this confluence, this great flood of visitors. (Indicating his poem.) I have in this rough work shaped out a man Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug With amplest entertainment. My free drift	 Halts not particularly but moves itself In a wide sea of wax. No leveled malice Infects one comma in the course I hold, But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on, Leaving no tract behind.	 

PAINTER How shall I understand you? 

POET  I will unbolt to you. You see how all conditions, how all minds, As well of glib and slipp’ry creatures as Of grave and austere quality, tender down	 Their services to Lord Timon. His large fortune, Upon his good and gracious nature hanging, Subdues and properties to his love and tendance All sorts of hearts—yea, from the glass-faced flatterer To Apemantus, that few things loves better	 Than to abhor himself; even he drops down The knee before him and returns in peace Most rich in Timon’s nod. 

PAINTER I saw them speak together. 

POET Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill	 Feigned Fortune to be throned. The base o’ th’ mount Is ranked with all deserts, all kind of natures That labor on the bosom of this sphere To propagate their states. Amongst them all Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fixed,	 One do I personate of Lord Timon’s frame, Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her, Whose present grace to present slaves and servants Translates his rivals. 

PAINTER ’Tis conceived to scope.	 This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks, With one man beckoned from the rest below, Bowing his head against the steepy mount To climb his happiness, would be well expressed In our condition.	 

POET Nay, sir, but hear me on. All those which were his fellows but of late, Some better than his value, on the moment Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance, Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,	 Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him Drink the free air. 

PAINTER Ay, marry, what of these? 

POET When Fortune in her shift and change of mood Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants,	 Which labored after him to the mountain’s top Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down, Not one accompanying his declining foot. 

PAINTER ’Tis common. A thousand moral paintings I can show	 That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune’s More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen The foot above the head.	 

<ACTION>Trumpets sound. Enter Lord Timon, addressing himselfcourteously to every suitor. He is accompanied by aMessenger and followed by Lucilius and otherServants.</ACTION> 

TIMON Imprisoned is he, say you? 

MESSENGER Ay, my good lord. Five talents is his debt, His means most short, his creditors most strait. Your honorable letter he desires To those have shut him up, which failing	 Periods his comfort. 

TIMON Noble Ventidius. Well, I am not of that feather to shake off My friend when he must need me. I do know him A gentleman that well deserves a help,	 Which he shall have. I’ll pay the debt and free him. 

MESSENGER Your Lordship ever binds him. 

TIMON Commend me to him. I will send his ransom; And, being enfranchised, bid him come to me. ’Tis not enough to help the feeble up,	 But to support him after. Fare you well. 

MESSENGER All happiness to your Honor.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter an old Athenian.</ACTION> 

OLD MAN Lord Timon, hear me speak. 

TIMON Freely, good father. 

OLD MAN Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.	 

TIMON I have so. What of him? 

OLD MAN Most noble Timon, call the man before thee. 

TIMON Attends he here or no?—Lucilius! 

LUCILIUS Here, at your Lordship’s service. 

OLD MAN This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,	 By night frequents my house. I am a man That from my first have been inclined to thrift, And my estate deserves an heir more raised Than one which holds a trencher. 

TIMON  Well. What further?	 

OLD MAN One only daughter have I, no kin else On whom I may confer what I have got. The maid is fair, o’ th’ youngest for a bride, And I have bred her at my dearest cost In qualities of the best. This man of thine	 Attempts her love. I prithee, noble lord, Join with me to forbid him her resort. Myself have spoke in vain. 

TIMON  The man is honest. 

OLD MAN Therefore he will be, Timon.	 His honesty rewards him in itself; It must not bear my daughter. 

TIMON Does she love him? 

OLD MAN She is young and apt. Our own precedent passions do instruct us	 What levity’s in youth. 

TIMON ,  <ACTION>to Lucilius</ACTION> Love you the maid? 

LUCILIUS Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it. 

OLD MAN If in her marriage my consent be missing— I call the gods to witness—I will choose	 Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world And dispossess her all. 

TIMON How shall she be endowed If she be mated with an equal husband? 

OLD MAN Three talents on the present; in future, all.	 

TIMON This gentleman of mine hath served me long. To build his fortune, I will strain a little, For ’tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter. What you bestow, in him I’ll counterpoise, And make him weigh with her.	 

OLD MAN Most noble lord, Pawn me to this your honor, she is his. 

TIMON My hand to thee; mine honor on my promise. 

LUCILIUS Humbly I thank your Lordship. Never may That state or fortune fall into my keeping	 Which is not owed to you. 

<ACTION>He exits with the old Athenian.</ACTION> 

POET ,  <ACTION>presenting his poem to Timon</ACTION> Vouchsafe my labor, and long live your Lordship. 

TIMON I thank you. You shall hear from me anon. Go not away.—What have you there, my friend? 

PAINTER A piece of painting which I do beseech	 Your Lordship to accept. 

TIMON Painting is welcome. The painting is almost the natural man, For, since dishonor traffics with man’s nature, He is but outside; these penciled figures are	 Even such as they give out. I like your work, And you shall find I like it. Wait attendance Till you hear further from me. 

PAINTER The gods preserve you. 

TIMON Well fare you, gentleman. Give me your hand.	 We must needs dine together.—Sir, your jewel Hath suffered under praise. 

JEWELER What, my lord? Dispraise? 

TIMON A mere satiety of commendations. If I should pay you for ’t as ’tis extolled,	 It would unclew me quite. 

JEWELER My lord, ’tis rated As those which sell would give. But you well know Things of like value, differing in the owners, Are prizèd by their masters. Believe ’t, dear lord,	 You mend the jewel by the wearing it. 

TIMON Well mocked. 

MERCHANT No, my good lord. He speaks the common tongue, Which all men speak with him. 

<ACTION>Enter Apemantus.</ACTION> 

TIMON Look who comes here. Will you be chid?	 

JEWELER We’ll bear, with your Lordship. 

MERCHANT He’ll spare none. 

TIMON Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus. 

APEMANTUS Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow— When thou art Timon’s dog, and these knaves honest.	 

TIMON Why dost thou call them knaves? Thou know’st them not. 

APEMANTUS Are they not Athenians? 

TIMON Yes. 

APEMANTUS Then I repent not.	215 

JEWELER You know me, Apemantus? 

APEMANTUS Thou know’st I do. I called thee by thy name. 

TIMON Thou art proud, Apemantus. 

APEMANTUS Of nothing so much as that I am not like	 Timon. 

TIMON Whither art going? 

APEMANTUS To knock out an honest Athenian’s brains. 

TIMON That’s a deed thou ’lt die for. 

APEMANTUS Right, if doing nothing be death by th’ law.	 

TIMON  How lik’st thou this picture, Apemantus? 

APEMANTUS The best, for the innocence. 

TIMON Wrought he not well that painted it? 

APEMANTUS He wrought better that made the painter, and yet he’s but a filthy piece of work.	 

PAINTER You’re a dog. 

APEMANTUS Thy mother’s of my generation. What’s she, if I be a dog? 

TIMON Wilt dine with me, Apemantus? 

APEMANTUS No. I eat not lords.	 

TIMON An thou shouldst, thou ’dst anger ladies. 

APEMANTUS O, they eat lords. So they come by great bellies. 

TIMON That’s a lascivious apprehension. 

APEMANTUS So thou apprehend’st it. Take it for thy	 labor. 

TIMON How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus? 

APEMANTUS Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost a man a doit. 

TIMON What dost thou think ’tis worth?	 

APEMANTUS Not worth my thinking.—How now, poet? 

POET How now, philosopher? 

APEMANTUS Thou liest. 

POET Art not one? 

APEMANTUS Yes.	 

POET  Then I lie not. 

APEMANTUS Art not a poet? 

POET Yes. 

APEMANTUS Then thou liest. Look in thy last work, where thou hast feigned him a worthy fellow.	 

POET That’s not feigned. He is so. 

APEMANTUS Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy labor. He that loves to be flattered is worthy o’ th’ flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord! 

TIMON What wouldst do then, Apemantus?	 

APEMANTUS E’en as Apemantus does now—hate a lord with my heart. 

TIMON  What? Thyself? 

APEMANTUS Ay. 

TIMON Wherefore?	 

APEMANTUS That I had no angry wit to be a lord.—Art not thou a merchant? 

MERCHANT Ay, Apemantus. 

APEMANTUS  Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not. 

MERCHANT  If traffic do it, the gods do it.	 

APEMANTUS Traffic’s thy god, and thy god confound thee! 

<ACTION>Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger.</ACTION> 

TIMON What trumpet’s that? 

MESSENGER ’Tis Alcibiades and some twenty horse, All of companionship.	 

TIMON Pray, entertain them. Give them guide to us. Some Servants exit with Messenger. You must needs dine with me. Go not you hence Till I have thanked you.—When dinner’s done Show me this piece.—I am joyful of your sights. 

<ACTION>Enter Alcibiades with the rest.</ACTION> 

Most welcome, sir.	They bow to each other.   

APEMANTUS ,  <ACTION>apart</ACTION> So, so, there! Aches contract and starve your supple joints! That there should be small love amongst these sweet knaves, And all this courtesy! The strain of man’s bred out	 Into baboon and monkey. 

ALCIBIADES ,  <ACTION>to Timon</ACTION> Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feed Most hungerly on your sight. 

TIMON Right welcome, sir. Ere we depart, we’ll share a bounteous time	 In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in. 

<ACTION>All but Apemantus exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter two Lords.</ACTION> 

FIRST LORD What time o’ day is ’t, Apemantus? 

APEMANTUS  Time to be honest. 

FIRST LORD  That time serves still. 

APEMANTUS The most accursèd thou, that still omit’st it.	 

SECOND LORD Thou art going to Lord Timon’s feast? 

APEMANTUS Ay, to see meat fill knaves, and wine heat fools. 

SECOND LORD Fare thee well, fare thee well. 

APEMANTUS Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice. 

SECOND LORD Why, Apemantus?	 

APEMANTUS Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to give thee none. 

FIRST LORD Hang thyself. 

APEMANTUS No, I will do nothing at thy bidding. Make thy requests to thy friend.	 

SECOND LORD Away, unpeaceable dog, or I’ll spurn thee hence. 

APEMANTUS I will fly, like a dog, the heels o’ th’ ass. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

FIRST LORD He’s opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in And taste Lord Timon’s bounty? He outgoes The very heart of kindness.	 

SECOND LORD He pours it out. Plutus, the god of gold, Is but his steward. No meed but he repays Sevenfold above itself. No gift to him But breeds the giver a return exceeding All use of quittance.	 

FIRST LORD The noblest mind he carries That ever governed man. 

SECOND LORD Long may he live in fortunes. Shall we in? I’ll keep you company. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
