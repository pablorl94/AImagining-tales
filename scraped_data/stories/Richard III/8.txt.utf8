<ACTION>The trumpets sound. Enter young Prince Edward,Richard Duke of Gloucester, Buckingham,the Cardinal, Catesby, and others.</ACTION> 

BUCKINGHAM Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber. 

RICHARD ,  <ACTION>to Prince</ACTION> Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts’ sovereign. The weary way hath made you melancholy. 

PRINCE No, uncle, but our crosses on the way Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy. I want more uncles here to welcome me. 

RICHARD Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years Hath not yet dived into the world’s deceit; Nor more can you distinguish of a man Than of his outward show, which, God He knows,	 Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart. Those uncles which you want were dangerous. Your Grace attended to their sugared words But looked not on the poison of their hearts. God keep you from them, and from such false	 friends. 

PRINCE God keep me from false friends, but they were none. 

RICHARD My lord, the Mayor of London comes to greet you. 

<ACTION>Enter Lord Mayor with others.</ACTION> 

MAYOR God bless your Grace with health and happy days. 

PRINCE I thank you, good my lord, and thank you all.—	 I thought my mother and my brother York Would long ere this have met us on the way. Fie, what a slug is Hastings that he comes not To tell us whether they will come or no! 

<ACTION>Enter Lord Hastings.</ACTION> 

BUCKINGHAM And in good time here comes the sweating lord.	 

PRINCE Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come? 

HASTINGS On what occasion God He knows, not I, The Queen your mother and your brother York Have taken sanctuary. The tender prince Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace,	 But by his mother was perforce withheld. 

BUCKINGHAM Fie, what an indirect and peevish course Is this of hers!—Lord Cardinal, will your Grace Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York Unto his princely brother presently?—	 If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him, And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce. 

CARDINAL My lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory Can from his mother win the Duke of York, Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate	 To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid We should infringe the holy privilege Of blessèd sanctuary! Not for all this land Would I be guilty of so deep a sin. 

BUCKINGHAM You are too senseless obstinate, my lord,	 Too ceremonious and traditional. Weigh it but with the grossness of this age, You break not sanctuary in seizing him. The benefit thereof is always granted To those whose dealings have deserved the place	 And those who have the wit to claim the place. This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it. Then taking him from thence that is not there, You break no privilege nor charter there.	 Oft have I heard of sanctuary men, But sanctuary children, never till now. 

CARDINAL My lord, you shall o’errule my mind for once.— Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me? 

HASTINGS  I go, my lord. 

PRINCE Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may. 

<ACTION>The Cardinal and Hastings exit.</ACTION> 

Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come, Where shall we sojourn till our coronation? 

RICHARD Where it seems best unto your royal self. If I may counsel you, some day or two	 Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower; Then where you please and shall be thought most fit For your best health and recreation. 

PRINCE I do not like the Tower, of any place.— Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?	 

BUCKINGHAM He did, my gracious lord, begin that place, Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified. 

PRINCE Is it upon record, or else reported Successively from age to age, he built it? 

BUCKINGHAM  Upon record, my gracious lord.	 

PRINCE But say, my lord, it were not registered, Methinks the truth should live from age to age, As ’twere retailed to all posterity, Even to the general all-ending day. 

RICHARD ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> So wise so young, they say, do never live long.	 

PRINCE  What say you, uncle? 

RICHARD I say, without characters fame lives long. <ACTION>Aside. </ACTION> Thus, like the formal Vice, Iniquity, I moralize two meanings in one word. 

PRINCE That Julius Caesar was a famous man.	 With what his valor did enrich his wit, His wit set down to make his valor live. Death makes no conquest of this conqueror, For now he lives in fame, though not in life. I’ll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham—	 

BUCKINGHAM  What, my gracious lord? 

PRINCE An if I live until I be a man, I’ll win our ancient right in France again Or die a soldier, as I lived a king. 

RICHARD ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Short summers lightly have a forward spring.	 

<ACTION>Enter young Duke of York, Hastings, and theCardinal.</ACTION> 

BUCKINGHAM Now in good time here comes the Duke of York. 

PRINCE Richard of York, how fares our loving brother? 

YORK Well, my dread lord—so must I call you now. 

PRINCE Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours. Too late he died that might have kept that title,	 Which by his death hath lost much majesty. 

RICHARD How fares our cousin, noble lord of York? 

YORK I thank you, gentle uncle. O my lord, You said that idle weeds are fast in growth. The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far.	 

RICHARD He hath, my lord. 

YORK   And therefore is he idle? 

RICHARD O my fair cousin, I must not say so. 

YORK Then he is more beholding to you than I. 

RICHARD He may command me as my sovereign,	 But you have power in me as in a kinsman. 

YORK I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger. 

RICHARD My dagger, little cousin? With all my heart. 

PRINCE A beggar, brother? 

YORK Of my kind uncle, that I know will give, And being but a toy, which is no grief to give. 

RICHARD A greater gift than that I’ll give my cousin. 

YORK A greater gift? O, that’s the sword to it. 

RICHARD Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough. 

YORK O, then I see you will part but with light gifts.	 In weightier things you’ll say a beggar nay. 

RICHARD It is too heavy for your Grace to wear. 

YORK I weigh it lightly, were it heavier. 

RICHARD What, would you have my weapon, little lord? 

YORK I would, that I might thank you as you call me.	 

RICHARD How? 

YORK  Little. 

PRINCE My lord of York will still be cross in talk. Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him. 

YORK You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me.—	 Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me. Because that I am little, like an ape, He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders. 

BUCKINGHAM ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!	 To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle, He prettily and aptly taunts himself. So cunning and so young is wonderful. 

RICHARD , <ACTION> to Prince</ACTION> My lord, will ’t please you pass along? Myself and my good cousin Buckingham	 Will to your mother, to entreat of her To meet you at the Tower and welcome you. 

YORK , <ACTION> to Prince</ACTION> What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord? 

PRINCE My Lord Protector needs will have it so. 

YORK I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.	 

RICHARD  Why, what should you fear? 

YORK Marry, my uncle Clarence’ angry ghost. My grandam told me he was murdered there. 

PRINCE  I fear no uncles dead. 

RICHARD Nor none that live, I hope.	 

PRINCE An if they live, I hope I need not fear. To York. But come, my lord. With a heavy heart, Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower. 

<ACTION>A sennet. Prince Edward, the Duke of York,and Hastings exit. Richard, Buckingham,and Catesby remain.</ACTION> 

BUCKINGHAM , <ACTION> to Richard</ACTION> Think you, my lord, this little prating York Was not incensèd by his subtle mother	 To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously? 

RICHARD No doubt, no doubt. O, ’tis a parlous boy, Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable. He is all the mother’s, from the top to toe. 

BUCKINGHAM Well, let them rest.—Come hither, Catesby.	 Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend As closely to conceal what we impart. Thou knowest our reasons, urged upon the way. What thinkest thou? Is it not an easy matter To make William Lord Hastings of our mind	 For the installment of this noble duke In the seat royal of this famous isle? 

CATESBY He, for his father’s sake, so loves the Prince That he will not be won to aught against him. 

BUCKINGHAM What think’st thou then of Stanley? Will not he?	 

CATESBY He will do all in all as Hastings doth. 

BUCKINGHAM Well then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby, And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings How he doth stand affected to our purpose And summon him tomorrow to the Tower	 To sit about the coronation. If thou dost find him tractable to us, Encourage him and tell him all our reasons. If he be leaden, icy, cold, unwilling, Be thou so too, and so break off the talk,	 And give us notice of his inclination; For we tomorrow hold divided councils, Wherein thyself shalt highly be employed. 

RICHARD Commend me to Lord William. Tell him, Catesby, His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries	 Tomorrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle, And bid my lord, for joy of this good news, Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more. 

BUCKINGHAM Good Catesby, go effect this business soundly. 

CATESBY My good lords both, with all the heed I can.	 

RICHARD Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep? 

CATESBY You shall, my lord. 

RICHARD At Crosby House, there shall you find us both. 

<ACTION>Catesby exits.</ACTION> 

BUCKINGHAM Now, my lord, what shall we do if we perceive Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?	 

RICHARD Chop off his head. Something we will determine. And look when I am king, claim thou of me The earldom of Hereford, and all the movables Whereof the King my brother was possessed. 

BUCKINGHAM I’ll claim that promise at your Grace’s hand.	 

RICHARD And look to have it yielded with all kindness. Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards We may digest our complots in some form. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
