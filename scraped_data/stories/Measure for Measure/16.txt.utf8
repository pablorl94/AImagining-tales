<ACTION>Enter Duke, Varrius, Lords, Angelo, Escalus, Lucio,Provost, Officers, and Citizens at several doors.</ACTION> 

DUKE , <ACTION> to Angelo</ACTION> My very worthy cousin, fairly met. To Escalus. Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you. 

ANGELO, ESCALUS Happy return be to your royal Grace. 

DUKE Many and hearty thankings to you both.	 We have made inquiry of you, and we hear Such goodness of your justice that our soul Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks, Forerunning more requital. 

ANGELO You make my bonds still greater.	 

DUKE O, your desert speaks loud, and I should wrong it To lock it in the wards of covert bosom When it deserves with characters of brass A forted residence ’gainst the tooth of time And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand	 And let the subject see, to make them know That outward courtesies would fain proclaim Favors that keep within.—Come, Escalus, You must walk by us on our other hand. And good supporters are you.	 

<ACTION>Enter Friar Peter and Isabella.</ACTION> 

FRIAR PETER ,  <ACTION>to Isabella</ACTION> Now is your time. Speak loud, and kneel before him. 

ISABELLA , <ACTION> kneeling</ACTION> Justice, O royal duke. Vail your regard Upon a wronged—I would fain have said, a maid. O worthy prince, dishonor not your eye By throwing it on any other object	 Till you have heard me in my true complaint And given me justice, justice, justice, justice. 

DUKE Relate your wrongs. In what, by whom? Be brief. Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice. Reveal yourself to him.	 

ISABELLA O worthy duke, You bid me seek redemption of the devil. Hear me yourself, for that which I must speak Must either punish me, not being believed, Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me,	 here. 

ANGELO My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm. She hath been a suitor to me for her brother Cut off by course of justice. 

ISABELLA , <ACTION> standing</ACTION> By course of justice!  	 

ANGELO And she will speak most bitterly and strange. 

ISABELLA Most strange, but yet most truly will I speak. That Angelo’s forsworn, is it not strange? That Angelo’s a murderer, is ’t not strange? That Angelo is an adulterous thief,	 An hypocrite, a virgin-violator, Is it not strange, and strange? 

DUKE Nay, it is ten times strange. 

ISABELLA It is not truer he is Angelo Than this is all as true as it is strange.	 Nay, it is ten times true, for truth is truth To th’ end of reck’ning. 

DUKE Away with her. Poor soul, She speaks this in th’ infirmity of sense. 

ISABELLA O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest	 There is another comfort than this world, That thou neglect me not with that opinion That I am touched with madness. Make not impossible That which but seems unlike. ’Tis not impossible	 But one, the wicked’st caitiff on the ground, May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute As Angelo. Even so may Angelo, In all his dressings, caracts, titles, forms, Be an archvillain. Believe it, royal prince,	 If he be less, he’s nothing, but he’s more, Had I more name for badness. 

DUKE By mine honesty, If she be mad—as I believe no other— Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,	 Such a dependency of thing on thing, As e’er I heard in madness. 

ISABELLA  O gracious duke, Harp not on that; nor do not banish reason For inequality, but let your reason serve	 To make the truth appear where it seems hid, And hide the false seems true. 

DUKE  Many that are not mad Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?		 

ISABELLA I am the sister of one Claudio, Condemned upon the act of fornication To lose his head, condemned by Angelo. I, in probation of a sisterhood, Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio	 As then the messenger— 

LUCIO ,  <ACTION>to Duke</ACTION> That’s I, an ’t like your Grace. I came to her from Claudio and desired her To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo For her poor brother’s pardon.	 

ISABELLA ,  <ACTION>to Duke</ACTION> That’s he indeed. 

DUKE , <ACTION> to Lucio</ACTION> You were not bid to speak. 

LUCIO No, my good lord, Nor wished to hold my peace. 

DUKE I wish you now, then.	 Pray you take note of it, and when you have A business for yourself, pray heaven you then Be perfect. 

LUCIO  I warrant your Honor. 

DUKE The warrant’s for yourself. Take heed to ’t.	 

ISABELLA This gentleman told somewhat of my tale. 

LUCIO Right. 

DUKE It may be right, but you are i’ the wrong To speak before your time.—Proceed. 

ISABELLA I went	 To this pernicious caitiff deputy— 

DUKE That’s somewhat madly spoken. 

ISABELLA Pardon it; The phrase is to the matter. 

DUKE Mended again. The matter; proceed.	 

ISABELLA In brief, to set the needless process by: How I persuaded, how I prayed and kneeled, How he refelled me, and how I replied— For this was of much length—the vile conclusion I now begin with grief and shame to utter.	 He would not, but by gift of my chaste body To his concupiscible intemperate lust, Release my brother; and after much debatement, My sisterly remorse confutes mine honor, And I did yield to him. But the next morn betimes,	 His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant For my poor brother’s head. 

DUKE  This is most likely! 

ISABELLA O, that it were as like as it is true! 

DUKE By heaven, fond wretch, thou know’st not what	 thou speak’st, Or else thou art suborned against his honor In hateful practice. First, his integrity Stands without blemish; next, it imports no reason That with such vehemency he should pursue	 Faults proper to himself. If he had so offended, He would have weighed thy brother by himself And not have cut him off. Someone hath set you on. Confess the truth, and say by whose advice Thou cam’st here to complain.	 

ISABELLA  And is this all? Then, O you blessèd ministers above, Keep me in patience, and with ripened time Unfold the evil which is here wrapped up In countenance. Heaven shield your Grace from	 woe, As I, thus wronged, hence unbelievèd go. 

DUKE I know you’d fain be gone.—An officer! An Officer comes forward. To prison with her. Shall we thus permit A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall	 On him so near us? This needs must be a practice.— Who knew of your intent and coming hither? 

ISABELLA One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick. 

<ACTION>Officer exits with Isabella.</ACTION> 

DUKE A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick? 

LUCIO My lord, I know him. ’Tis a meddling friar.	 I do not like the man. Had he been lay, my lord, For certain words he spake against your Grace In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly. 

DUKE Words against me? This’ a good friar, belike. And to set on this wretched woman here	 Against our substitute! Let this friar be found. 

LUCIO But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar, I saw them at the prison. A saucy friar, A very scurvy fellow. 

FRIAR PETER , <ACTION> to Duke</ACTION> Blessed be your royal Grace.	 I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard Your royal ear abused. First hath this woman Most wrongfully accused your substitute, Who is as free from touch or soil with her As she from one ungot.	 

DUKE We did believe no less. Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of? 

FRIAR PETER I know him for a man divine and holy, Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler, As he’s reported by this gentleman;	 And on my trust, a man that never yet Did, as he vouches, misreport your Grace. 

LUCIO My lord, most villainously, believe it. 

FRIAR PETER Well, he in time may come to clear himself; But at this instant he is sick, my lord,	 Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request, Being come to knowledge that there was complaint Intended ’gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither To speak as from his mouth, what he doth know Is true and false, and what he with his oath	 And all probation will make up full clear Whensoever he’s convented. First, for this woman, To justify this worthy nobleman, So vulgarly and personally accused, Her shall you hear disprovèd to her eyes	 Till she herself confess it. 

DUKE Good friar, let’s hear it.— Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo? O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!— Give us some seats.—Come, cousin Angelo,	 In this I’ll be impartial. Be you judge Of your own cause.	Duke and Angelo are seated. 

<ACTION>Enter Mariana, veiled.</ACTION> 

Is this the witness, friar? First, let her show her face, and after speak. 

MARIANA Pardon, my lord, I will not show my face	 Until my husband bid me. 

DUKE What, are you married? 

MARIANA No, my lord. 

DUKE Are you a maid? 

MARIANA No, my lord.	 

DUKE A widow, then? 

MARIANA Neither, my lord. 

DUKE Why you are nothing, then, neither maid, widow, nor wife? 

LUCIO My lord, she may be a punk, for many of them	 are neither maid, widow, nor wife. 

DUKE Silence that fellow. I would he had some cause to prattle for himself. 

LUCIO  Well, my lord. 

MARIANA My lord, I do confess I ne’er was married,	 And I confess besides I am no maid. I have known my husband, yet my husband Knows not that ever he knew me. 

LUCIO He was drunk, then, my lord; it can be no better. 

DUKE For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so	 too. 

LUCIO Well, my lord. 

DUKE This is no witness for Lord Angelo. 

MARIANA  Now I come to ’t, my lord. She that accuses him of fornication	 In selfsame manner doth accuse my husband, And charges him, my lord, with such a time When, I’ll depose, I had him in mine arms With all th’ effect of love. 

ANGELO  Charges she more than me?	 

MARIANA Not that I know. 

DUKE  No? You say your husband. 

MARIANA Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo, Who thinks he knows that he ne’er knew my body, But knows, he thinks, that he knows Isabel’s.	 

ANGELO This is a strange abuse. Let’s see thy face. 

MARIANA My husband bids me. Now I will unmask. 

<ACTION>She removes her veil.</ACTION> 

This is that face, thou cruel Angelo, Which once thou swor’st was worth the looking on. This is the hand which, with a vowed contract,	 Was fast belocked in thine. This is the body That took away the match from Isabel And did supply thee at thy garden house In her imagined person. 

DUKE , <ACTION> to Angelo</ACTION> Know you this woman?	 

LUCIO Carnally, she says. 

DUKE Sirrah, no more. 

LUCIO Enough, my lord. 

ANGELO My lord, I must confess I know this woman, And five years since there was some speech of	 marriage Betwixt myself and her, which was broke off, Partly for that her promisèd proportions Came short of composition, but in chief For that her reputation was disvalued	 In levity. Since which time of five years I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her, Upon my faith and honor. 

MARIANA ,  <ACTION>kneeling, to Duke</ACTION> Noble prince, As there comes light from heaven and words from	 breath, As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue, I am affianced this man’s wife as strongly As words could make up vows. And, my good lord, But Tuesday night last gone in ’s garden house	 He knew me as a wife. As this is true, Let me in safety raise me from my knees, Or else forever be confixèd here A marble monument. 

ANGELO I did but smile till now.	 Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice. My patience here is touched. I do perceive These poor informal women are no more But instruments of some more mightier member That sets them on. Let me have way, my lord,	 To find this practice out. 

DUKE  Ay, with my heart, And punish them to your height of pleasure.— Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman, Compact with her that’s gone, think’st thou thy	 oaths, Though they would swear down each particular saint, Were testimonies against his worth and credit That’s sealed in approbation?—You, Lord Escalus,	 Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains To find out this abuse, whence ’tis derived. 

<ACTION>The Duke rises. Escalus is seated.</ACTION> 

There is another friar that set them on. Let him be sent for. 

FRIAR PETER Would he were here, my lord, for he indeed	 Hath set the women on to this complaint; Your provost knows the place where he abides, And he may fetch him. 

DUKE , <ACTION> to Provost</ACTION> Go, do it instantly. 

<ACTION>Provost exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>To Angelo.</ACTION> And you, my noble and well-warranted	 cousin, Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth, Do with your injuries as seems you best In any chastisement. I for a while Will leave you; but stir not you till you have	 Well determined upon these slanderers. 

ESCALUS My lord, we’ll do it throughly.	 

<ACTION>Duke exits.</ACTION> 

Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person? 

LUCIO Cucullus non facit monachum, honest in nothing	 but in his clothes, and one that hath spoke most villainous speeches of the Duke. 

ESCALUS  We shall entreat you to abide here till he come, and enforce them against him. We shall find this friar a notable fellow.	 

LUCIO  As any in Vienna, on my word. 

ESCALUS Call that same Isabel here once again. I would speak with her.	 

<ACTION>An Attendant exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>To Angelo. </ACTION> Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question. You shall see how I’ll handle her.	 

LUCIO  Not better than he, by her own report. 

ESCALUS  Say you? 

LUCIO Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately, she would sooner confess; perchance publicly she’ll be ashamed.	 

ESCALUS I will go darkly to work with her. 

LUCIO That’s the way, for women are light at midnight. 

<ACTION>Enter Duke as a Friar, Provost, and Isabella,with Officers.</ACTION> 

ESCALUS ,  <ACTION>to Isabella</ACTION> Come on, mistress. Here’s a gentlewoman denies all that you have said. 

LUCIO My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of, here	 with the Provost. 

ESCALUS In very good time. Speak not you to him till we call upon you. 

LUCIO Mum. 

ESCALUS , <ACTION> to disguised Duke</ACTION> Come, sir, did you set	 these women on to slander Lord Angelo? They have confessed you did. 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> ’Tis false. 

ESCALUS  How? Know you where you are? 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> Respect to your great place, and let the devil	 Be sometime honored for his burning throne. Where is the Duke? ’Tis he should hear me speak. 

ESCALUS The Duke’s in us, and we will hear you speak. Look you speak justly. 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> Boldly, at least.—But, O, poor souls,	 Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox? Good night to your redress. Is the Duke gone? Then is your cause gone too. The Duke’s unjust Thus to retort your manifest appeal, And put your trial in the villain’s mouth	 Which here you come to accuse. 

LUCIO This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of. 

ESCALUS , <ACTION> to disguised Duke</ACTION> Why, thou unreverend and unhallowed friar, Is ’t not enough thou hast suborned these women To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth	 And in the witness of his proper ear, To call him villain? And then to glance from him To th’ Duke himself, to tax him with injustice?— Take him hence. To th’ rack with him. We’ll touse him	 Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose. What? “Unjust”? 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar </ACTION> Be not so hot. The Duke Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he Dare rack his own. His subject am I not,	 Nor here provincial. My business in this state Made me a looker-on here in Vienna, Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble Till it o’errun the stew. Laws for all faults, But faults so countenanced that the strong statutes	 Stand like the forfeits in a barber’s shop, As much in mock as mark. 

ESCALUS Slander to th’ state! Away with him to prison. 

ANGELO , <ACTION> to Lucio</ACTION> What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?	 Is this the man that you did tell us of? 

LUCIO ’Tis he, my lord.—Come hither, Goodman Baldpate. Do you know me? 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar </ACTION> I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice. I met you at the prison in the absence of	 the Duke. 

LUCIO O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the Duke? 

DUKE ,  <ACTION>as Friar</ACTION> Most notedly, sir. 

LUCIO  Do you so, sir? And was the Duke a fleshmonger,	 a fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be? 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> You must, sir, change persons with me ere you make that my report. You indeed spoke so of him, and much more, much worse.	 

LUCIO O, thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the nose for thy speeches? 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> I protest I love the Duke as I love myself. 

ANGELO  Hark how the villain would close now, after	 his treasonable abuses! 

ESCALUS Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with him to prison. Where is the Provost? Provost comes forward. Away with him to prison. Lay bolts enough upon him. Let him speak no more. Away	 with those giglets too, and with the other confederate companion. 

<ACTION>Provost seizes the disguised Duke.</ACTION> 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar </ACTION> Stay, sir, stay awhile. 

ANGELO What, resists he?—Help him, Lucio. 

LUCIO , <ACTION> to the disguised Duke</ACTION> Come, sir, come, sir,	 come, sir. Foh, sir! Why you bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must you? Show your knave’s visage, with a pox to you! Show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour! Will ’t not off? 

<ACTION>He pulls off the friar’s hood, and reveals the Duke.Angelo and Escalus stand.</ACTION> 

DUKE Thou art the first knave that e’er mad’st a duke.—	 First, provost, let me bail these gentle three. To Lucio. Sneak not away, sir, for the friar and you Must have a word anon.—Lay hold on him. 

LUCIO  This may prove worse than hanging.	 

DUKE , <ACTION> to Escalus</ACTION> What you have spoke I pardon. Sit you down. We’ll borrow place of him.  <ACTION>To Angelo.</ACTION> Sir, by your leave. Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,	 Rely upon it till my tale be heard, And hold no longer out. 

ANGELO O my dread lord, I should be guiltier than my guiltiness To think I can be undiscernible,	 When I perceive your Grace, like power divine, Hath looked upon my passes. Then, good prince, No longer session hold upon my shame, But let my trial be mine own confession. Immediate sentence then and sequent death	 Is all the grace I beg. 

DUKE Come hither, Mariana. 

<ACTION>Mariana stands and comes forward.</ACTION> 

To Angelo. Say, wast thou e’er contracted to this woman? 

ANGELO  I was, my lord.	 

DUKE Go take her hence and marry her instantly. <ACTION>To Friar Peter.</ACTION> Do you the office, friar, which consummate, Return him here again.—Go with him, provost. 

<ACTION>Angelo, Mariana, Friar Peter, and Provost exit.</ACTION> 

ESCALUS My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonor	 Than at the strangeness of it. 

DUKE  Come hither, Isabel. Your friar is now your prince. As I was then Advertising and holy to your business, Not changing heart with habit, I am still	 Attorneyed at your service. 

ISABELLA  O, give me pardon That I, your vassal, have employed and pained Your unknown sovereignty. 

DUKE You are pardoned,	 Isabel. And now, dear maid, be you as free to us. Your brother’s death, I know, sits at your heart, And you may marvel why I obscured myself, Laboring to save his life, and would not rather	 Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid, It was the swift celerity of his death, Which I did think with slower foot came on, That brained my purpose. But peace be with him.	 That life is better life past fearing death Than that which lives to fear. Make it your comfort, So happy is your brother. 

ISABELLA I do, my lord. 

<ACTION>Enter Angelo, Mariana, Friar Peter, and Provost.</ACTION> 

DUKE For this new-married man approaching here,	 Whose salt imagination yet hath wronged Your well-defended honor, you must pardon For Mariana’s sake. But as he adjudged your brother— Being criminal in double violation	 Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach Thereon dependent for your brother’s life— The very mercy of the law cries out Most audible, even from his proper tongue, “An Angelo for Claudio, death for death.”	 Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure; Like doth quit like, and measure still for measure.— Then, Angelo, thy fault’s thus manifested, Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee	 vantage. We do condemn thee to the very block Where Claudio stooped to death, and with like haste.— Away with him.	 

MARIANA  O my most gracious lord, I hope you will not mock me with a husband. 

DUKE It is your husband mocked you with a husband. Consenting to the safeguard of your honor, I thought your marriage fit. Else imputation,	 For that he knew you, might reproach your life And choke your good to come. For his possessions, Although by confiscation they are ours, We do instate and widow you with all To buy you a better husband.	 

MARIANA O my dear lord, I crave no other nor no better man. 

DUKE Never crave him. We are definitive. 

MARIANA , <ACTION> kneeling</ACTION> Gentle my liege— 

DUKE  You do but lose your labor.—	 Away with him to death.  

<ACTION>To Lucio.</ACTION> Now, sir, to you. 

MARIANA O, my good lord.—Sweet Isabel, take my part. Lend me your knees, and all my life to come I’ll lend you all my life to do you service.	 

DUKE Against all sense you do importune her. Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact, Her brother’s ghost his pavèd bed would break And take her hence in horror. 

MARIANA Isabel,	 Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me, Hold up your hands, say nothing. I’ll speak all. They say best men are molded out of faults, And, for the most, become much more the better For being a little bad. So may my husband.	 O Isabel, will you not lend a knee? 

DUKE He dies for Claudio’s death. 

ISABELLA , <ACTION> kneeling </ACTION> Most bounteous sir, Look, if it please you, on this man condemned As if my brother lived. I partly think	 A due sincerity governed his deeds Till he did look on me. Since it is so, Let him not die. My brother had but justice, In that he did the thing for which he died. For Angelo,	 His act did not o’ertake his bad intent, And must be buried but as an intent That perished by the way. Thoughts are no subjects, Intents but merely thoughts. 

MARIANA  Merely, my lord.	 

DUKE Your suit’s unprofitable. Stand up, I say. 

<ACTION>They stand.</ACTION> 

I have bethought me of another fault.— Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded At an unusual hour? 

PROVOST It was commanded so.	 

DUKE Had you a special warrant for the deed? 

PROVOST No, my good lord, it was by private message. 

DUKE For which I do discharge you of your office. Give up your keys. 

PROVOST  Pardon me, noble lord.	 I thought it was a fault, but knew it not, Yet did repent me after more advice, For testimony whereof, one in the prison That should by private order else have died, I have reserved alive.	 

DUKE  What’s he? 

PROVOST His name is Barnardine. 

DUKE I would thou hadst done so by Claudio. Go fetch him hither. Let me look upon him. 

<ACTION>Provost exits.</ACTION> 

ESCALUS ,  <ACTION>to Angelo</ACTION> I am sorry one so learnèd and so wise	 As you, Lord Angelo, have still appeared, Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood And lack of tempered judgment afterward. 

ANGELO I am sorry that such sorrow I procure; And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart	 That I crave death more willingly than mercy. ’Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it. 

<ACTION>Enter Barnardine and Provost, Claudio, muffled,and Juliet.</ACTION> 

DUKE , <ACTION> to Provost</ACTION> Which is that Barnardine? 

PROVOST  This, my lord. 

DUKE There was a friar told me of this man.—	 Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul That apprehends no further than this world, And squar’st thy life according. Thou ’rt condemned. But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all, And pray thee take this mercy to provide	 For better times to come.—Friar, advise him. I leave him to your hand.—What muffled fellow’s that? 

PROVOST This is another prisoner that I saved Who should have died when Claudio lost his head,	 As like almost to Claudio as himself. 

<ACTION>He unmuffles Claudio.</ACTION> 

DUKE , <ACTION> to Isabella</ACTION> If he be like your brother, for his sake Is he pardoned; and for your lovely sake, Give me your hand and say you will be mine, He is my brother too. But fitter time for that.	 By this Lord Angelo perceives he’s safe; Methinks I see a quick’ning in his eye.— Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well. Look that you love your wife, her worth worth yours.	 I find an apt remission in myself. And yet here’s one in place I cannot pardon. <ACTION>To Lucio. </ACTION> You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward, One all of luxury, an ass, a madman.	 Wherein have I so deserved of you That you extol me thus? 

LUCIO Faith, my lord, I spoke it but according to the trick. If you will hang me for it, you may, but I had rather it would please you I might be whipped.	 

DUKE  Whipped first, sir, and hanged after.— Proclaim it, provost, round about the city, If any woman wronged by this lewd fellow— As I have heard him swear himself there’s one Whom he begot with child—let her appear,	 And he shall marry her. The nuptial finished, Let him be whipped and hanged. 

LUCIO I beseech your Highness do not marry me to a whore. Your Highness said even now I made you a duke. Good my lord, do not recompense me in	 making me a cuckold. 

DUKE Upon mine honor, thou shalt marry her. Thy slanders I forgive and therewithal Remit thy other forfeits.—Take him to prison, And see our pleasure herein executed.	 

LUCIO Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death, whipping, and hanging. 

DUKE Slandering a prince deserves it. 

<ACTION>Officers take Lucio away.</ACTION> 

She, Claudio, that you wronged, look you restore.— Joy to you, Mariana.—Love her, Angelo.	 I have confessed her, and I know her virtue.— Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness. There’s more behind that is more gratulate.— Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy. We shall employ thee in a worthier place.—	 Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home The head of Ragozine for Claudio’s. Th’ offense pardons itself.—Dear Isabel, I have a motion much imports your good, Whereto if you’ll a willing ear incline,	 What’s mine is yours, and what is yours is mine.— So, bring us to our palace, where we’ll show What’s yet behind that’s meet you all should know. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
