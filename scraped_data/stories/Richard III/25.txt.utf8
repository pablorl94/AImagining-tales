<ACTION>Enter King Richard, Ratcliffe, and Soldiers.</ACTION> 

RICHARD What said Northumberland as touching Richmond? 

RATCLIFFE That he was never trainèd up in arms. 

RICHARD He said the truth. And what said Surrey then? 

RATCLIFFE He smiled and said “The better for our purpose.” 

RICHARD He was in the right, and so indeed it is. 

<ACTION>The clock striketh.</ACTION> 

Tell the clock there. Give me a calendar. 

<ACTION>He looks in an almanac.</ACTION> 

Who saw the sun today? 

RATCLIFFE   Not I, my lord. 

RICHARD Then he disdains to shine, for by the book He should have braved the east an hour ago. A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliffe! 

RATCLIFFE My lord. 

RICHARD   The sun will not be seen today. The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.	 I would these dewy tears were from the ground. Not shine today? Why, what is that to me More than to Richmond, for the selfsame heaven That frowns on me looks sadly upon him. 

NORFOLK Arm, arm, my lord. The foe vaunts in the field.	 

RICHARD Come, bustle, bustle. Caparison my horse.— Call up Lord Stanley; bid him bring his power.— I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain, And thus my battle shall be orderèd: My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,	 Consisting equally of horse and foot; Our archers shall be placèd in the midst. John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey, Shall have the leading of this foot and horse. They thus directed, we will follow	 In the main battle, whose puissance on either side Shall be well wingèd with our chiefest horse. This, and Saint George to boot!—What think’st thou, Norfolk? 

NORFOLK A good direction, warlike sovereign. <ACTION>He sheweth him a paper.</ACTION> This found I on my tent this morning. 

RICHARD <ACTION>reads	Jockey of Norfolk, be not so bold.	For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.</ACTION> A thing devisèd by the enemy.— Go, gentlemen, every man unto his charge.	 Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls. Conscience is but a word that cowards use, Devised at first to keep the strong in awe. Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law. March on. Join bravely. Let us to it pell mell,	 If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell. 

<ACTION>His oration to his army.</ACTION> 

What shall I say more than I have inferred? Remember whom you are to cope withal, A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways, A scum of Bretons and base lackey peasants,	 Whom their o’ercloyèd country vomits forth To desperate adventures and assured destruction. You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest; You having lands and blessed with beauteous wives, They would restrain the one, distain the other. And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow, Long kept in Brittany at our mother’s cost, A milksop, one that never in his life Felt so much cold as overshoes in snow? Let’s whip these stragglers o’er the seas again,	 Lash hence these overweening rags of France, These famished beggars weary of their lives, Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit, For want of means, poor rats, had hanged themselves. 350 If we be conquered, let men conquer us, And not these bastard Bretons, whom our fathers Have in their own land beaten, bobbed, and thumped, And in record left them the heirs of shame. Shall these enjoy our lands, lie with our wives, Ravish our daughters? <ACTION>Drum afar off.</ACTION> Hark, I hear their drum. 

Fight, gentlemen of England.—Fight, bold yeomen.—	 Draw, archers; draw your arrows to the head.— Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood.Amaze the welkin with your broken staves.— 

<ACTION>Enter a Messenger.</ACTION> 

What says Lord Stanley? Will he bring his power? 

MESSENGER My lord, he doth deny to come.	365 

RICHARD Off with his son George’s head! 

NORFOLK My lord, the enemy is past the marsh. After the battle let George Stanley die. 

RICHARD A thousand hearts are great within my bosom. Advance our standards. Set upon our foes. Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George, Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons. Upon them! Victory sits on our helms. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
