<ACTION>Enter Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, a Page with atorch before him, met by Sir Thomas Lovell.</ACTION> 

GARDINER It’s one o’clock, boy, is ’t not? 

PAGE It hath struck. 

GARDINER These should be hours for necessities, Not for delights; times to repair our nature With comforting repose, and not for us	 To waste these times.—Good hour of night, Sir Thomas. Whither so late? 

LOVELL Came you from the King, my lord? 

GARDINER I did, Sir Thomas, and left him at primero	 With the Duke of Suffolk. 

LOVELL I must to him too, Before he go to bed. I’ll take my leave. 

GARDINER Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovell. What’s the matter? It seems you are in haste. An if there be	 No great offense belongs to ’t, give your friend Some touch of your late business. Affairs that walk, As they say spirits do, at midnight have In them a wilder nature than the business That seeks dispatch by day.	 

LOVELL My lord, I love you, And durst commend a secret to your ear Much weightier than this work. The Queen’s in labor— They say in great extremity—and feared	 She’ll with the labor end. 

GARDINER The fruit she goes with I pray for heartily, that it may find Good time and live; but for the stock, Sir Thomas, I wish it grubbed up now.	 

LOVELL Methinks I could Cry the amen, and yet my conscience says She’s a good creature and, sweet lady, does Deserve our better wishes. 

GARDINER But, sir, sir,	 Hear me, Sir Thomas. You’re a gentleman Of mine own way. I know you wise, religious; And let me tell you, it will ne’er be well, ’Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take ’t of me, Till Cranmer, Cromwell—her two hands—and she Sleep in their graves. 

LOVELL Now, sir, you speak of two The most remarked i’ th’ kingdom. As for Cromwell, Besides that of the Jewel House, is made Master O’ th’ Rolls and the King’s secretary; further, sir, Stands in the gap and trade of more preferments, With which the time will load him. Th’ Archbishop Is the King’s hand and tongue, and who dare speak One syllable against him? 

GARDINER Yes, yes, Sir Thomas,	 There are that dare, and I myself have ventured To speak my mind of him. And indeed this day, Sir—I may tell it you, I think—I have Incensed the lords o’ th’ Council that he is— For so I know he is, they know he is—	 A most arch heretic, a pestilence That does infect the land; with which they, moved, Have broken with the King, who hath so far Given ear to our complaint, of his great grace And princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs Our reasons laid before him, hath commanded Tomorrow morning to the Council board He be convented. He’s a rank weed, Sir Thomas, And we must root him out. From your affairs I hinder you too long. Goodnight, Sir Thomas.	 

LOVELL Many good nights, my lord. I rest your servant.

LOVELL I could not personally deliver to her What you commanded me, but by her woman I sent your message, who returned her thanks	 In the great’st humbleness, and desired your Highness Most heartily to pray for her. 

KING   What sayst thou, ha? To pray for her? What, is she crying out? 

LOVELL So said her woman, and that her suff’rance made	 Almost each pang a death. 

KING Alas, good lady! 

SUFFOLK God safely quit her of her burden, and With gentle travail, to the gladding of Your Highness with an heir!	 

KING ’Tis midnight, Charles. Prithee, to bed, and in thy prayers remember Th’ estate of my poor queen. Leave me alone, For I must think of that which company Would not be friendly to.

I have, and most unwillingly, of late Heard many grievous—I do say, my lord, Grievous—complaints of you, which, being considered, Have moved us and our Council that you shall	 This morning come before us, where I know You cannot with such freedom purge yourself But that, till further trial in those charges Which will require your answer, you must take Your patience to you and be well contented	 To make your house our Tower. You a brother of us, It fits we thus proceed, or else no witness Would come against you. 

CRANMER , kneeling  I humbly thank your Highness,	 And am right glad to catch this good occasion Most throughly to be winnowed, where my chaff And corn shall fly asunder. For I know There’s none stands under more calumnious tongues Than I myself, poor man. 

KING Stand up, good Canterbury! Thy truth and thy integrity is rooted In us, thy friend. Give me thy hand. Stand up. 

<ACTION>Cranmer rises.</ACTION> 

Prithee, let’s walk. Now by my halidom, What manner of man are you? My lord, I looked	 You would have given me your petition that I should have ta’en some pains to bring together Yourself and your accusers and to have heard you Without endurance further. 

CRANMER Most dread liege,	 The good I stand on is my truth and honesty. If they shall fail, I with mine enemies Will triumph o’er my person, which I weigh not, Being of those virtues vacant. I fear nothing What can be said against me.	 

KING Know you not How your state stands i’ th’ world, with the whole world? Your enemies are many and not small; their practices Must bear the same proportion, and not ever	 The justice and the truth o’ th’ question carries The due o’ th’ verdict with it. At what ease Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt To swear against you? Such things have been done. You are potently opposed, and with a malice	 Of as great size. Ween you of better luck, I mean in perjured witness, than your master, Whose minister you are, whiles here he lived Upon this naughty earth? Go to, go to. You take a precipice for no leap of danger	 And woo your own destruction. 

CRANMER God and your Majesty Protect mine innocence, or I fall into The trap is laid for me. 

KING Be of good cheer.	 They shall no more prevail than we give way to. Keep comfort to you, and this morning see You do appear before them. If they shall chance, In charging you with matters, to commit you, The best persuasions to the contrary	 Fail not to use, and with what vehemency Th’ occasion shall instruct you. If entreaties Will render you no remedy, this ring Deliver them, and your appeal to us There make before them.	 <ACTION>He gives Cranmer a ring.  </ACTION> <ACTION>Aside.</ACTION> Look, the good man weeps!
