KING JOHN ,  <ACTION>to Queen Eleanor</ACTION> So shall it be. Your Grace shall stay behind So strongly guarded. To Arthur. Cousin, look not sad. Thy grandam loves thee, and thy uncle will As dear be to thee as thy father was. 

ARTHUR O, this will make my mother die with grief!	 

KING JOHN ,  <ACTION>to Bastard</ACTION> Cousin, away for England! Haste before, And ere our coining see thou shake the bags Of hoarding abbots; imprisoned angels Set at liberty. The fat ribs of peace Must by the hungry now be fed upon.	 Use our commission in his utmost force. 

BASTARD Bell, book, and candle shall not drive me back When gold and silver becks me to come on. I leave your Highness.—Grandam, I will pray, If ever I remember to be holy,	 For your fair safety. So I kiss your hand. 

QUEEN ELEANOR Farewell, gentle cousin. 

KING JOHN Coz, farewell.	Bastard exits. 

QUEEN ELEANOR ,  <ACTION>to Arthur</ACTION> Come hither, little kinsman. Hark, a word. They walk aside. 

KING JOHN Come hither, Hubert.   

<ACTION>He takes Hubert aside.</ACTION> 

O, my gentle Hubert, We owe thee much. Within this wall of flesh There is a soul counts thee her creditor, And with advantage means to pay thy love. And, my good friend, thy voluntary oath	 Lives in this bosom dearly cherishèd. Give me thy hand. I had a thing to say, But I will fit it with some better tune. By heaven, Hubert, I am almost ashamed To say what good respect I have of thee.	 

HUBERT I am much bounden to your Majesty. 

KING JOHN Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet, But thou shalt have. And, creep time ne’er so slow, Yet it shall come for me to do thee good. I had a thing to say—but let it go. The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day, Attended with the pleasures of the world, Is all too wanton and too full of gauds To give me audience. If the midnight bell Did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth	 Sound on into the drowsy race of night; If this same were a churchyard where we stand, And thou possessèd with a thousand wrongs; Or if that surly spirit, melancholy, Had baked thy blood and made it heavy, thick,	 Which else runs tickling up and down the veins, Making that idiot, laughter, keep men’s eyes And strain their cheeks to idle merriment, A passion hateful to my purposes; Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,	 Hear me without thine ears, and make reply Without a tongue, using conceit alone, Without eyes, ears, and harmful sound of words; Then, in despite of brooded watchful day, I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts. But, ah, I will not. 

Yet I love thee well, And by my troth I think thou lov’st me well.

HUBERT So well that what you bid me undertake, Though that my death were adjunct to my act, By heaven, I would do it.	 

KING JOHN Do not I know thou wouldst? Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye On yon young boy. I’ll tell thee what, my friend, He is a very serpent in my way, And wheresoe’er this foot of mine doth tread,	 He lies before me. Dost thou understand me? Thou art his keeper. 

HUBERT And I’ll keep him so That he shall not offend your Majesty. 

KING JOHN Death.	 

HUBERT  My lord? 

KING JOHN  A  grave. 

HUBERT He shall not live. 

KING JOHN Enough. I could be merry now. Hubert, I love thee.	 Well, I’ll not say what I intend for thee. Remember. He turns to Queen Eleanor. Madam, fare you well. I’ll send those powers o’er to your Majesty. 

QUEEN ELEANOR My blessing go with thee.	 

KING JOHN , <ACTION> to Arthur</ACTION> For England, cousin, go. Hubert shall be your man, attend on you With all true duty.—On toward Calais, ho! 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
