<ACTION>Enter Troilus and Cressida.</ACTION> 

TROILUS Dear, trouble not yourself. The morn is cold. 

CRESSIDA Then, sweet my lord, I’ll call mine uncle down. He shall unbolt the gates. 

TROILUS Trouble him not. To bed, to bed! Sleep kill those pretty eyes	 And give as soft attachment to thy senses As infants’ empty of all thought! 

CRESSIDA Good morrow, then. 

TROILUS I prithee now, to bed. 

CRESSIDA Are you aweary of me?	 

TROILUS O Cressida! But that the busy day, Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows, And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer, I would not from thee. 

CRESSIDA Night hath been too brief.	 

TROILUS Beshrew the witch! With venomous wights she stays As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love With wings more momentary-swift than thought. You will catch cold and curse me. 

CRESSIDA Prithee, tarry. You men will never tarry.	 O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off, And then you would have tarried. Hark, there’s one up. 

PANDARUS ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> What’s all the doors open here? 

TROILUS It is your uncle. 

CRESSIDA A pestilence on him! Now will he be mocking.	 I shall have such a life! 

<ACTION>Enter Pandarus.</ACTION> 

PANDARUS How now, how now? How go maidenheads? Here, you maid! Where’s my Cousin Cressid? 

CRESSIDA Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle. You bring me to do—and then you flout me too.	 

PANDARUS To do what, to do what?—Let her say what.—What have I brought you to do? 

CRESSIDA Come, come, beshrew your heart! You’ll ne’er be good Nor suffer others. 

PANDARUS  Ha, ha! Alas, poor wretch! Ah, poor capocchia!	 Has ’t not slept tonight? Would he not—a naughty man—let it sleep? A bugbear take him! 

CRESSIDA ,  <ACTION>to Troilus</ACTION> Did not I tell you? Would he were knocked i’ th’ head! 

<ACTION>One knocks.</ACTION> 

Who’s that at door?—Good uncle, go and see.— My lord, come you again into my chamber.	 You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily. 

TROILUS Ha, ha! 

CRESSIDA Come, you are deceived. I think of no such thing. 

<ACTION>Knock.</ACTION> 

How earnestly they knock! Pray you, come in. I would not for half Troy have you seen here.	 

<ACTION>Troilus and Cressida exit.</ACTION> 

PANDARUS Who’s there? What’s the matter? Will you beat down the door? 

<ACTION>Enter Aeneas.</ACTION> 

How now? What’s the matter? 

AENEAS  Good morrow, lord, good morrow. 

PANDARUS Who’s there? My Lord Aeneas? By my troth,	 I knew you not. What news with you so early? 

AENEAS Is not Prince Troilus here? 

PANDARUS  Here? What should he do here? 

AENEAS Come, he is here, my lord. Do not deny him. It doth import him much to speak with me.	 

PANDARUS Is he here, say you? It’s more than I know, I’ll be sworn. For my own part, I came in late. What should he do here? 

AENEAS Ho, nay, then! Come, come, you’ll do him wrong ere you are ware. You’ll be so true to him to	 be false to him. Do not you know of him, but yet go fetch him hither. Go. 

<ACTION>Enter Troilus.</ACTION> 

TROILUS How now? What’s the matter? 

AENEAS My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you, My matter is so rash. There is at hand	 Paris your brother and Deiphobus, The Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor Delivered to us; and for him forthwith, Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour, We must give up to Diomedes’ hand	 The Lady Cressida. 

TROILUS Is it so concluded? 

AENEAS By Priam and the general state of Troy. They are at hand and ready to effect it. 

TROILUS How my achievements mock me!	 I will go meet them. And, my Lord Aeneas, We met by chance; you did not find me here. 

AENEAS Good, good, my lord; the secrets of nature Have not more gift in taciturnity. 

<ACTION>Troilus and Aeneas exit.</ACTION> 

PANDARUS Is ’t possible? No sooner got but lost? The	 devil take Antenor! The young prince will go mad. A plague upon Antenor! I would they had broke ’s neck! 

<ACTION>Enter Cressida.</ACTION> 

CRESSIDA How now? What’s the matter? Who was here? 

PANDARUS  Ah, ah!	 

CRESSIDA Why sigh you so profoundly? Where’s my lord? Gone? Tell me, sweet uncle, what’s the matter? 

PANDARUS Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above! 

CRESSIDA O the gods! What’s the matter?	 

PANDARUS Pray thee, get thee in. Would thou hadst ne’er been born! I knew thou wouldst be his death. O, poor gentleman! A plague upon Antenor! 

CRESSIDA  Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees I beseech you, what’s the matter?	 

PANDARUS  Thou must be gone, wench; thou must be gone. Thou art changed for Antenor. Thou must to thy father and be gone from Troilus. ’Twill be his death; ’twill be his bane. He cannot bear it. 

CRESSIDA O you immortal gods! I will not go.	 

PANDARUS Thou must. 

CRESSIDA I will not, uncle. I have forgot my father. I know no touch of consanguinity, No kin, no love, no blood, no soul so near me As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine,	 Make Cressid’s name the very crown of falsehood If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death Do to this body what extremes you can, But the strong base and building of my love Is as the very center of the Earth,	 Drawing all things to it. I’ll go in and weep— 

PANDARUS Do, do. 

CRESSIDA Tear my bright hair, and scratch my praisèd cheeks, Crack my clear voice with sobs, and break my heart With sounding “Troilus.” I will not go from Troy.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
