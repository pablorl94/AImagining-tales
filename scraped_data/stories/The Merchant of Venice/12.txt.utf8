<ACTION>Enter Solanio and Salarino.</ACTION> 

SOLANIO Now, what news on the Rialto? 

SALARINO Why, yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wracked on the Narrow Seas—the Goodwins, I think they call the place—a very dangerous flat, and fatal, where the	 carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip Report be an honest woman of her word. 

SOLANIO I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbors believe	 she wept for the death of a third husband. But it is true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the honest Antonio—O, that I had a title good enough to keep his name company!—	 

SALARINO Come, the full stop. 

SOLANIO Ha, what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a ship. 

SALARINO I would it might prove the end of his losses. 

SOLANIO Let me say “amen” betimes, lest the devil	 cross my prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew. 

<ACTION>Enter Shylock.</ACTION> 

How now, Shylock, what news among the merchants? 

SHYLOCK You knew, none so well, none so well as you,	 of my daughter’s flight. 

SALARINO  That’s certain. I for my part knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal. 

SOLANIO And Shylock for his own part knew the bird was fledge, and then it is the complexion of them	 all to leave the dam. 

SHYLOCK She is damned for it. 

SALARINO That’s certain, if the devil may be her judge. 

SHYLOCK My own flesh and blood to rebel! 

SOLANIO Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these	 years? 

SHYLOCK I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood. 

SALARINO There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory, more between your bloods than there is between red wine and	 Rhenish. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no? 

SHYLOCK  There I have another bad match! A bankrout, a prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto, a beggar that was used to come so smug	 upon the mart! Let him look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond. He was wont to lend money for a Christian cur’sy; let him look to his bond. 

SALARINO Why, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not	 take his flesh! What’s that good for? 

SHYLOCK To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me and hindered me half a million, laughed at my losses, mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted	 my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies— and what’s his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to	 the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall	 we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge! The villainy you teach me I	 will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction. 

<ACTION>Enter a man from Antonio.</ACTION> 

SERVINGMAN Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house and desires to speak with you both. 

SALARINO We have been up and down to seek him.	 

<ACTION>Enter Tubal.</ACTION> 

SOLANIO Here comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be matched unless the devil himself turn Jew. 

<ACTION>Salarino, Solanio, and the Servingman exit.</ACTION> 

SHYLOCK How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa? Hast thou found my daughter?	 

TUBAL  I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her. 

SHYLOCK Why, there, there, there, there! A diamond gone cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfurt! The curse never fell upon our nation till now, I	 never felt it till now. Two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious jewels! I would my daughter were dead at my foot and the jewels in her ear; would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in her coffin. No news of them? Why so? And	 I know not what’s spent in the search! Why, thou loss upon loss! The thief gone with so much, and so much to find the thief, and no satisfaction, no revenge, nor no ill luck stirring but what lights a’ my shoulders, no sighs but a’ my breathing, no tears but	 a’ my shedding. 

TUBAL Yes, other men have ill luck, too. Antonio, as I heard in Genoa— 

SHYLOCK What, what, what? Ill luck, ill luck? 

TUBAL —hath an argosy cast away coming from	 Tripolis. 

SHYLOCK I thank God, I thank God! Is it true, is it true? 

TUBAL I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack. 

SHYLOCK I thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good	 news! Ha, ha, heard in Genoa— 

TUBAL Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night fourscore ducats. 

SHYLOCK  Thou stick’st a dagger in me. I shall never see my gold again. Fourscore ducats at a sitting,	 fourscore ducats! 

TUBAL There came divers of Antonio’s creditors in my company to Venice that swear he cannot choose but break. 

SHYLOCK I am very glad of it. I’ll plague him, I’ll	 torture him. I am glad of it. 

TUBAL One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey. 

SHYLOCK Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my turquoise! I had it of Leah when I was a	 bachelor. I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys. 

TUBAL But Antonio is certainly undone. 

SHYLOCK Nay, that’s true, that’s very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an officer. Bespeak him a fortnight before. I	 will have the heart of him if he forfeit, for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will. Go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue. Go, good Tubal, at our synagogue, Tubal. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
