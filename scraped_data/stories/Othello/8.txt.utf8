<ACTION>Enter Desdemona, Cassio, and Emilia.</ACTION> 

DESDEMONA Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do All my abilities in thy behalf. 

EMILIA Good madam, do. I warrant it grieves my husband As if the cause were his. 

DESDEMONA O, that’s an honest fellow! Do not doubt, Cassio,	 But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were. 

CASSIO Bounteous madam, Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio, He’s never anything but your true servant.	 

DESDEMONA I know ’t. I thank you. You do love my lord; You have known him long; and be you well assured He shall in strangeness stand no farther off Than in a politic distance. 

CASSIO Ay, but, lady,	 That policy may either last so long, Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet, Or breed itself so out of circumstance, That, I being absent and my place supplied, My general will forget my love and service.	 

DESDEMONA Do not doubt that. Before Emilia here, I give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee, If I do vow a friendship, I’ll perform it To the last article. My lord shall never rest: I’ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;	 His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift; I’ll intermingle everything he does With Cassio’s suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio, For thy solicitor shall rather die Than give thy cause away.	 

<ACTION>Enter Othello and Iago.</ACTION> 

EMILIA Madam, here comes my lord. 

CASSIO Madam, I’ll take my leave. 

DESDEMONA Why, stay, and hear me speak. 

CASSIO Madam, not now. I am very ill at ease, Unfit for mine own purposes.	 

DESDEMONA Well, do your discretion.	 <ACTION>Cassio exits.</ACTION> 

IAGO Ha, I like not that. 

OTHELLO What dost thou say? 

IAGO Nothing, my lord; or if—I know not what. 

OTHELLO Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?	 

IAGO Cassio, my lord? No, sure, I cannot think it That he would steal away so guiltylike, Seeing your coming. 

OTHELLO I do believe ’twas he. 

DESDEMONA How now, my lord?	 I have been talking with a suitor here, A man that languishes in your displeasure. 

OTHELLO Who is ’t you mean? 

DESDEMONA Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord, If I have any grace or power to move you,	 His present reconciliation take; For if he be not one that truly loves you, That errs in ignorance and not in cunning, I have no judgment in an honest face. I prithee call him back.	 

OTHELLO Went he hence now? 

DESDEMONA  Yes, faith, so humbled That he hath left part of his grief with me To suffer with him. Good love, call him back. 

OTHELLO Not now, sweet Desdemon. Some other time.	 

DESDEMONA But shall ’t be shortly? 

OTHELLO The sooner, sweet, for you. 

DESDEMONA Shall ’t be tonight at supper? 

OTHELLO No, not tonight. 

DESDEMONA Tomorrow dinner, then?	 

OTHELLO  I shall not dine at home; I meet the captains at the citadel. 

DESDEMONA Why then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn, On Tuesday noon or night; on Wednesday morn. I prithee name the time, but let it not	 Exceed three days. In faith, he’s penitent; And yet his trespass, in our common reason— Save that, they say, the wars must make example Out of her best—is not almost a fault T’ incur a private check. When shall he come?	 Tell me, Othello. I wonder in my soul What you would ask me that I should deny, Or stand so mamm’ring on? What? Michael Cassio, That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time, When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,	 Hath ta’en your part—to have so much to do To bring him in! By ’r Lady, I could do much— 

OTHELLO Prithee, no more. Let him come when he will; I will deny thee nothing. 

DESDEMONA Why, this is not a boon!	 ’Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves, Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm, Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit To your own person. Nay, when I have a suit Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,	 It shall be full of poise and difficult weight, And fearful to be granted. 

OTHELLO I will deny thee nothing! Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this, To leave me but a little to myself.	 

DESDEMONA Shall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord. 

OTHELLO Farewell, my Desdemona. I’ll come to thee straight. 

DESDEMONA Emilia, come.—Be as your fancies teach you. Whate’er you be, I am obedient. 

<ACTION>Desdemona and Emilia exit.</ACTION> 

OTHELLO Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul	 But I do love thee! And when I love thee not, Chaos is come again. 

IAGO My noble lord— 

OTHELLO What dost thou say, Iago? 

IAGO Did Michael Cassio,	 When you wooed my lady, know of your love? 

OTHELLO He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask? 

IAGO But for a satisfaction of my thought, No further harm. 

OTHELLO Why of thy thought, Iago?	 

IAGO I did not think he had been acquainted with her. 

OTHELLO O yes, and went between us very oft. 

IAGO Indeed? 

OTHELLO Indeed? Ay, indeed! Discern’st thou aught in that? Is he not honest? 

IAGO Honest, my lord? 

OTHELLO Honest—ay, honest. 

IAGO My lord, for aught I know. 

OTHELLO What dost thou think? 

IAGO Think, my lord?	 

OTHELLO “Think, my lord?” By heaven, thou echo’st me As if there were some monster in thy thought Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something. I heard thee say even now, thou lik’st not that,	 When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like? And when I told thee he was of my counsel In my whole course of wooing, thou cried’st “Indeed?” And didst contract and purse thy brow together	 As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me, Show me thy thought. 

IAGO My lord, you know I love you. 

OTHELLO I think thou dost;	 And for I know thou ’rt full of love and honesty And weigh’st thy words before thou giv’st them breath, Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more. For such things in a false, disloyal knave	 Are tricks of custom; but in a man that’s just, They’re close dilations working from the heart That passion cannot rule. 

IAGO For Michael Cassio, I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.	 

OTHELLO I think so too. 

IAGO Men should be what they seem; Or those that be not, would they might seem none! 

OTHELLO Certain, men should be what they seem. 

IAGO Why then, I think Cassio’s an honest man.	 

OTHELLO Nay, yet there’s more in this. I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings, As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts The worst of words.	 

IAGO Good my lord, pardon me. Though I am bound to every act of duty, I am not bound to that all slaves are free to. Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false—	 As where’s that palace whereinto foul things Sometimes intrude not? Who has that breast so pure But some uncleanly apprehensions Keep leets and law days and in sessions sit	 With meditations lawful? 

OTHELLO Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago, If thou but think’st him wronged and mak’st his ear A stranger to thy thoughts. 

IAGO I do beseech you,	 Though I perchance am vicious in my guess— As, I confess, it is my nature’s plague To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy Shapes faults that are not—that your wisdom From one that so imperfectly conceits	 Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble Out of his scattering and unsure observance. It were not for your quiet nor your good, Nor for my manhood, honesty, and wisdom, To let you know my thoughts.	 

OTHELLO What dost thou mean? 

IAGO Good name in man and woman, dear my lord, Is the immediate jewel of their souls. Who steals my purse steals trash. ’Tis something, nothing;	 ’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands. But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeed.	 

OTHELLO  By heaven, I’ll know thy thoughts. 

IAGO You cannot, if my heart were in your hand, Nor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody. 

OTHELLO Ha? 

IAGO O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!	 It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger; But O, what damnèd minutes tells he o’er Who dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet strongly loves!	 

OTHELLO O misery! 

IAGO Poor and content is rich, and rich enough; But riches fineless is as poor as winter To him that ever fears he shall be poor. Good God, the souls of all my tribe defend	 From jealousy! 

OTHELLO Why, why is this? Think’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy, To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions? No. To be once in doubt	 Is once to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat When I shall turn the business of my soul To such exsufflicate and blown surmises, Matching thy inference. ’Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company, Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well. Where virtue is, these are more virtuous. Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt, For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago, I’ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove; And on the proof, there is no more but this: Away at once with love or jealousy. 

IAGO I am glad of this, for now I shall have reason To show the love and duty that I bear you	 With franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound, Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof. Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio; Wear your eyes thus, not jealous nor secure. I would not have your free and noble nature,	 Out of self-bounty, be abused. Look to ’t. I know our country disposition well. In Venice they do let God see the pranks They dare not show their husbands. Their best conscience	 Is not to leave ’t undone, but keep ’t unknown. 

OTHELLO  Dost thou say so? 

IAGO She did deceive her father, marrying you, And when she seemed to shake and fear your looks, She loved them most.	 

OTHELLO And so she did. 

IAGO Why, go to, then! She that, so young, could give out such a seeming, To seel her father’s eyes up close as oak, He thought ’twas witchcraft! But I am much to	 blame. I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much loving you. 

OTHELLO I am bound to thee forever. 

IAGO I see this hath a little dashed your spirits.	 

OTHELLO Not a jot, not a jot. 

IAGO I’ faith, I fear it has. I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love. But I do see you’re moved. I am to pray you not to strain my speech	 To grosser issues nor to larger reach Than to suspicion. 

OTHELLO I will not. 

IAGO Should you do so, my lord, My speech should fall into such vile success	 As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio’s my worthy friend. My lord, I see you’re moved. 

OTHELLO No, not much moved. I do not think but Desdemona’s honest.	 

IAGO Long live she so! And long live you to think so! 

OTHELLO And yet, how nature erring from itself— 

IAGO Ay, there’s the point. As, to be bold with you, Not to affect many proposèd matches Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,	 Whereto we see in all things nature tends— Foh! One may smell in such a will most rank, Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural— But pardon me—I do not in position Distinctly speak of her, though I may fear	 Her will, recoiling to her better judgment, May fall to match you with her country forms And happily repent. 

OTHELLO  Farewell, farewell! If more thou dost perceive, let me know more.	 Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago. 

IAGO ,  <ACTION>beginning to exit </ACTION> My lord, I take my leave. 

OTHELLO Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds. 

IAGO ,  <ACTION>returning</ACTION> My lord, I would I might entreat your Honor	 To scan this thing no farther. Leave it to time. Although ’tis fit that Cassio have his place— For sure he fills it up with great ability— Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile, You shall by that perceive him and his means.	 Note if your lady strain his entertainment With any strong or vehement importunity. Much will be seen in that. In the meantime, Let me be thought too busy in my fears— As worthy cause I have to fear I am—	 And hold her free, I do beseech your Honor. 

OTHELLO Fear not my government. 

IAGO I once more take my leave.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

OTHELLO This fellow’s of exceeding honesty, And knows all qualities with a learnèd spirit	 Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard, Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings, I’d whistle her off and let her down the wind To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black And have not those soft parts of conversation	 That chamberers have, or for I am declined Into the vale of years—yet that’s not much— She’s gone, I am abused, and my relief Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage, That we can call these delicate creatures ours	 And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad And live upon the vapor of a dungeon Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others’ uses. Yet ’tis the plague of great ones; Prerogatived are they less than the base.	 ’Tis destiny unshunnable, like death. Even then this forkèd plague is fated to us When we do quicken. Look where she comes. 

<ACTION>Enter Desdemona and Emilia.</ACTION> 

If she be false, heaven mocks itself! I’ll not believe ’t.	 

DESDEMONA How now, my dear Othello? Your dinner, and the generous islanders By you invited, do attend your presence. 

OTHELLO I am to blame. 

DESDEMONA Why do you speak so faintly? Are you not well?	 

OTHELLO I have a pain upon my forehead, here. 

DESDEMONA Faith, that’s with watching. ’Twill away again. Let me but bind it hard; within this hour It will be well. 

OTHELLO Your napkin is too little.	 Let it alone.	The handkerchief falls, unnoticed. Come, I’ll go in with you. 

DESDEMONA I am very sorry that you are not well. 

<ACTION>Othello and Desdemona exit.</ACTION> 

EMILIA ,  <ACTION>picking up the handkerchief</ACTION> I am glad I have found this napkin. This was her first remembrance from the Moor.	 My wayward husband hath a hundred times Wooed me to steal it. But she so loves the token (For he conjured her she should ever keep it) That she reserves it evermore about her To kiss and talk to. I’ll have the work ta’en out	 And give ’t Iago. What he will do with it Heaven knows, not I. I nothing but to please his fantasy. 

IAGO How now? What do you here alone? 

EMILIA Do not you chide. I have a thing for you.	 

IAGO You have a thing for me? It is a common thing— 

EMILIA Ha? 

IAGO To have a foolish wife. 

EMILIA O, is that all? What will you give me now For that same handkerchief?	 

IAGO What handkerchief? 

EMILIA What handkerchief? Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona, That which so often you did bid me steal. 

IAGO Hast stol’n it from her?	 

EMILIA No, faith, she let it drop by negligence, And to th’ advantage I, being here, took ’t up. Look, here ’tis. 

IAGO A good wench! Give it me. 

EMILIA What will you do with ’t, that you have been so	 earnest To have me filch it? 

IAGO ,  <ACTION>snatching it </ACTION> Why, what is that to you? 

EMILIA If it be not for some purpose of import, Give ’t me again. Poor lady, she’ll run mad	 When she shall lack it. 

IAGO Be not acknown on ’t. I have use for it. Go, leave me.	 

<ACTION>Emilia exits.</ACTION> 

I will in Cassio’s lodging lose this napkin And let him find it. Trifles light as air	 Are to the jealous confirmations strong As proofs of holy writ. This may do something. The Moor already changes with my poison; Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons, Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,	 But with a little act upon the blood Burn like the mines of sulfur. 

<ACTION>Enter Othello.</ACTION> 

I did say so. Look where he comes. Not poppy nor mandragora Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world	 Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep Which thou owedst yesterday. 

OTHELLO  Ha, ha, false to me? 

IAGO Why, how now, general? No more of that! 

OTHELLO Avaunt! Begone! Thou hast set me on the rack.	 I swear ’tis better to be much abused Than but to know ’t a little. 

IAGO How now, my lord? 

OTHELLO What sense had I of her stol’n hours of lust? I saw ’t not, thought it not; it harmed not me.	 I slept the next night well, fed well, was free and merry. I found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips. He that is robbed, not wanting what is stol’n, Let him not know ’t, and he’s not robbed at all.	 

IAGO I am sorry to hear this. 

OTHELLO I had been happy if the general camp, Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body, So I had nothing known. O, now, forever Farewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content!	 Farewell the plumèd troops and the big wars That makes ambition virtue! O, farewell! Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump, The spirit-stirring drum, th’ ear-piercing fife, The royal banner, and all quality,	 Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war! And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats Th’ immortal Jove’s dread clamors counterfeit, Farewell! Othello’s occupation’s gone! 

IAGO Is ’t possible, my lord?	 

OTHELLO Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore! Be sure of it. Give me the ocular proof, Or, by the worth of mine eternal soul, Thou hadst been better have been born a dog Than answer my waked wrath.	 

IAGO Is ’t come to this? 

OTHELLO Make me to see ’t, or at the least so prove it That the probation bear no hinge nor loop To hang a doubt on, or woe upon thy life! 

IAGO My noble lord—	 

OTHELLO If thou dost slander her and torture me, Never pray more. Abandon all remorse; On horror’s head horrors accumulate; Do deeds to make heaven weep, all Earth amazed; For nothing canst thou to damnation add	 Greater than that. 

IAGO O grace! O heaven forgive me! Are you a man? Have you a soul or sense? God b’ wi’ you. Take mine office.—O wretched fool, That liv’st to make thine honesty a vice!—	 O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world: To be direct and honest is not safe.— I thank you for this profit, and from hence I’ll love no friend, sith love breeds such offense. 

OTHELLO Nay, stay. Thou shouldst be honest.	 

IAGO I should be wise; for honesty’s a fool And loses that it works for. 

OTHELLO By the world, I think my wife be honest and think she is not. I think that thou art just and think thou art not.	 I’ll have some proof! Her name, that was as fresh As Dian’s visage, is now begrimed and black As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives, Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams, I’ll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!	 

IAGO I see you are eaten up with passion. I do repent me that I put it to you. You would be satisfied? 

OTHELLO  Would? Nay, and I will. 

IAGO And may; but how? How satisfied, my lord?	 Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on, Behold her topped? 

OTHELLO Death and damnation! O! 

IAGO It were a tedious difficulty, I think, To bring them to that prospect. Damn them then	 If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster More than their own! What then? How then? What shall I say? Where’s satisfaction? It is impossible you should see this, Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,	 As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross As ignorance made drunk. But yet I say, If imputation and strong circumstances Which lead directly to the door of truth Will give you satisfaction, you might have ’t.	 

OTHELLO Give me a living reason she’s disloyal. 

IAGO I do not like the office, But sith I am entered in this cause so far, Pricked to ’t by foolish honesty and love, I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,	 And being troubled with a raging tooth I could not sleep. There are a kind of men So loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter Their affairs. One of this kind is Cassio. In sleep I heard him say “Sweet Desdemona,	 Let us be wary, let us hide our loves.” And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand, Cry “O sweet creature!” then kiss me hard, As if he plucked up kisses by the roots That grew upon my lips; then laid his leg	 O’er my thigh, and sighed, and kissed, and then Cried “Cursèd fate that gave thee to the Moor!” 

OTHELLO O monstrous! Monstrous! 

IAGO Nay, this was but his dream.	 

OTHELLO But this denoted a foregone conclusion. ’Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream. 

IAGO And this may help to thicken other proofs That do demonstrate thinly. 

OTHELLO  I’ll tear her all to pieces.	 

IAGO Nay, but be wise. Yet we see nothing done. She may be honest yet. Tell me but this: Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief Spotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand? 

OTHELLO I gave her such a one. ’Twas my first gift.	 

IAGO I know not that; but such a handkerchief— I am sure it was your wife’s—did I today See Cassio wipe his beard with. 

OTHELLO If it be that— 

IAGO If it be that, or any that was hers,	 It speaks against her with the other proofs. 

OTHELLO O, that the slave had forty thousand lives! One is too poor, too weak for my revenge. Now do I see ’tis true. Look here, Iago, All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.	 ’Tis gone. Arise, black vengeance, from the hollow hell! Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught, For ’tis of aspics’ tongues!	 

IAGO Yet be content. 

OTHELLO O, blood, blood, blood! 

IAGO Patience, I say. Your mind perhaps may change. 

OTHELLO Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea, Whose icy current and compulsive course	 Ne’er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on To the Propontic and the Hellespont, Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace Shall ne’er look back, ne’er ebb to humble love, Till that a capable and wide revenge	 Swallow them up.  <ACTION>He kneels.</ACTION> Now by yond marble heaven, In the due reverence of a sacred vow, I here engage my words. 

IAGO Do not rise yet.	 <ACTION>Iago kneels.  </ACTION> Witness, you ever-burning lights above, You elements that clip us round about, Witness that here Iago doth give up The execution of his wit, hands, heart To wronged Othello’s service! Let him command,	 And to obey shall be in me remorse, What bloody business ever.	 <ACTION>They rise.</ACTION> 

OTHELLO I greet thy love Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous,	 And will upon the instant put thee to ’t. Within these three days let me hear thee say That Cassio’s not alive. 

IAGO My friend is dead. ’Tis done at your request. But let her live.	 

OTHELLO Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her, damn her! Come, go with me apart. I will withdraw To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.	 

IAGO I am your own forever.
