Scene 6 

<ACTION>Enter King Henry, with the Duke of York.</ACTION> 

KING HENRY Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear Is that the rebels have consumed with fire Our town of Ciceter in Gloucestershire, But whether they be ta’en or slain we hear not. 

<ACTION>Enter Northumberland.</ACTION> 

Welcome, my lord. What is the news?	 

NORTHUMBERLAND First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness. The next news is: I have to London sent The heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent. The manner of their taking may appear At large discoursèd in this paper here.	 

<ACTION>He gives King Henry a paper.</ACTION> 

KING HENRY We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains, And to thy worth will add right worthy gains. 

<ACTION>Enter Lord Fitzwater.</ACTION> 

FITZWATER My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely, Two of the dangerous consorted traitors	 That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow. 

KING HENRY Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot. Right noble is thy merit, well I wot. 

<ACTION>Enter Harry Percy with the Bishop of Carlisle.</ACTION> 

PERCY The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster, With clog of conscience and sour melancholy	 Hath yielded up his body to the grave. But here is Carlisle living, to abide Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride. 

KING HENRY Carlisle, this is your doom: Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,	 More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life. So, as thou liv’st in peace, die free from strife; For, though mine enemy thou hast ever been, High sparks of honor in thee have I seen. 

<ACTION>Enter Exton and Servingmen with the coffin.</ACTION> 

EXTON Great king, within this coffin I present	30 Thy buried fear. Herein all breathless lies The mightiest of thy greatest enemies, Richard of Bourdeaux, by me hither brought. 

KING HENRY Exton, I thank thee not, for thou hast wrought A deed of slander with thy fatal hand	 Upon my head and all this famous land. 

EXTON From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed. 

KING HENRY They love not poison that do poison need, Nor do I thee. Though I did wish him dead, I hate the murderer, love him murderèd. The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labor, But neither my good word nor princely favor. With Cain go wander through shades of night, And never show thy head by day nor light. 

<ACTION>Exton exits.</ACTION> 

Lords, I protest my soul is full of woe	 That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow. Come mourn with me for what I do lament, And put on sullen black incontinent. I’ll make a voyage to the Holy Land To wash this blood off from my guilty hand.	 

<ACTION>Servingmen lift the coffin to carry it out.</ACTION> 

March sadly after. Grace my mournings here In weeping after this untimely bier. 

<ACTION>They exit, following the coffin.</ACTION>
