More Spenser. Go away Spenser.

Melville talks about how cool towers are in general.

Then he talks about a cool elevated Rock called Rock Redondo, or Round Rock.

It's a round rock. You can climb up it and look out and see far away. (Look! Turtles! Alsoâ€¦more rocks!)

But first the narrator (Melville, more or less) goes back and describes the first time he came to the Rodondo. It was pretty.

He says it's also a good place to see birds, like penguins and pelicans.

And then there are lots of fish in the water roundabout, who are easy to catch since they haven't dealt with human beings much.

And now up the rock.
