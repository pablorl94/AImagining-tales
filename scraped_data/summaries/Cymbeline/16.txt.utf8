Dressed as a boy, Imogen is alone in the woods, wandering around. She's really tired from roaming around for two days.

Imogen remembers two beggars telling her where to go, but she still hasn't come across Lucius. She's lost, and she wonders if Pisanio was playing a trick on her when he said that Lucius would come by the next day.

Imogen finds a cave and calls out to see if anyone is in it.

No one answers, so Imogen goes on in and makes herself at home.

We interrupt this program for a helpful reading tip: Worried that your copy of the play divides scenes differently from the way we do here? Don't trip: the division of acts and scenes varies depending on which edition of the play you're reading. Some editions of the play (like Penguin Shakespeare) cut off Act 3, Scene 6 at the end of Imogen's speech and give her meeting with Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus its own section (Act 3, Scene 7). Some other editions (like the Riverside Shakespeare or MIT online) put them all together into one scene.

Now back to our program.
