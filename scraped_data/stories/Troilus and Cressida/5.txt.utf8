<ACTION>Enter Priam, Hector, Troilus, Paris and Helenus.</ACTION> 

PRIAM After so many hours, lives, speeches spent, Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks: “Deliver Helen, and all damage else— As honor, loss of time, travel, expense, Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed In hot digestion of this cormorant war— Shall be struck off.”—Hector, what say you to ’t? 

HECTOR Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I As far as toucheth my particular, Yet, dread Priam,	 There is no lady of more softer bowels, More spongy to suck in the sense of fear, More ready to cry out “Who knows what follows?” Than Hector is. The wound of peace is surety, Surety secure; but modest doubt is called	 The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches To th’ bottom of the worst. Let Helen go. Since the first sword was drawn about this question, Every tithe soul, ’mongst many thousand dismes, Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours.	 If we have lost so many tenths of ours To guard a thing not ours—nor worth to us, Had it our name, the value of one ten— What merit’s in that reason which denies The yielding of her up?	 

TROILUS Fie, fie, my brother, Weigh you the worth and honor of a king So great as our dread father’s in a scale Of common ounces? Will you with counters sum The past-proportion of his infinite,	 And buckle in a waist most fathomless With spans and inches so diminutive As fears and reasons? Fie, for godly shame! 

HELENUS No marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons, You are so empty of them. Should not our father	 Bear the great sway of his affairs with reason, Because your speech hath none that tell him so? 

TROILUS You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest. You fur your gloves with reason. Here are your reasons:	 You know an enemy intends you harm; You know a sword employed is perilous, And reason flies the object of all harm. Who marvels, then, when Helenus beholds A Grecian and his sword, if he do set	 The very wings of reason to his heels And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove Or like a star disorbed? Nay, if we talk of reason, Let’s shut our gates and sleep. Manhood and honor Should have hare hearts, would they but fat their	 thoughts With this crammed reason. Reason and respect Make livers pale and lustihood deject. 

HECTOR Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost The keeping.	 

TROILUS What’s aught but as ’tis valued? 

HECTOR But value dwells not in particular will; It holds his estimate and dignity As well wherein ’tis precious of itself As in the prizer. ’Tis mad idolatry	6 To make the service greater than the god; And the will dotes that is attributive To what infectiously itself affects Without some image of th’ affected merit. 

TROILUS I take today a wife, and my election	 Is led on in the conduct of my will— My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears, Two traded pilots ’twixt the dangerous shores Of will and judgment. How may I avoid, Although my will distaste what it elected,	 The wife I choose? There can be no evasion To blench from this and to stand firm by honor. We turn not back the silks upon the merchant When we have soiled them, nor the remainder viands	 We do not throw in unrespective sieve Because we now are full. It was thought meet Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks. Your breath with full consent bellied his sails; The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce	 And did him service. He touched the ports desired, And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive, He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness Wrinkles Apollo’s and makes pale the morning. Why keep we her? The Grecians keep our aunt. Is she worth keeping? Why, she is a pearl Whose price hath launched above a thousand ships And turned crowned kings to merchants. 

If you’ll avouch ’twas wisdom Paris went—	 As you must needs, for you all cried “Go, go”— If you’ll confess he brought home worthy prize— As you must needs, for you all clapped your hands And cried “Inestimable”—why do you now The issue of your proper wisdoms rate	 And do a deed that never Fortune did, Beggar the estimation which you prized Richer than sea and land?O, theft most base, That we have stol’n what we do fear to keep! But thieves unworthy of a thing so stol’n,	 That in their country did them that disgrace We fear to warrant in our native place. 

CASSANDRA ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> Cry, Trojans, cry! 

PRIAM  What noise? What shriek is this? 

TROILUS ’Tis our mad sister. I do know her voice.	 

CASSANDRA ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> Cry, Trojans! 

HECTOR It is Cassandra. 

<ACTION>Enter Cassandra raving.</ACTION> 

CASSANDRA Cry, Trojans, cry! Lend me ten thousand eyes, And I will fill them with prophetic tears. 

HECTOR Peace, sister, peace!	 

CASSANDRA Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled elders, Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry, Add to my clamors. Let us pay betimes A moiety of that mass of moan to come. Cry, Trojans, cry! Practice your eyes with tears. Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilium stand. Our firebrand brother Paris burns us all. Cry, Trojans, cry! A Helen and a woe! Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.	 

<ACTION>She exits.</ACTION> 

Hector thinks maybe they should listen to their sis but Troilus blows her off and says Cassandra is crazy, obviously. 

After the guys dismiss their sis, they get back to arguing about Helen. 

When Paris defends his right to keep Helen, his dad points out that, even though he gets to enjoy Helen's "honey," everybody else has to suffer for it. Gross, dad. 

Paris argues that keeping Helen will erase "the soil of her fair rape," meaning—he knows it was wrong to kidnap Helen, but he thinks that if he can fend off the Greeks and keep her, it will bring him honor. 

Troilus agrees and says that Helen's a great excuse to keep fighting so they can all gain "honor" on the battlefield. Fine. 

Hector agrees to keep fighting to keep Helen, since it's now a matter of honor.
