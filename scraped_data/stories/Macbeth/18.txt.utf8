<ACTION>Enter Macduff’s Wife, her Son, and Ross.</ACTION> 

LADY MACDUFF What had he done to make him fly the land? 

ROSS You must have patience, madam. 

LADY MACDUFF  He had none. His flight was madness. When our actions do not, Our fears do make us traitors.	 

ROSS You know not Whether it was his wisdom or his fear. 

LADY MACDUFF Wisdom? To leave his wife, to leave his babes, His mansion and his titles in a place From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;	 He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren, The most diminutive of birds, will fight, Her young ones in her nest, against the owl. All is the fear, and nothing is the love, As little is the wisdom, where the flight	 So runs against all reason. 

ROSS My dearest coz, I pray you school yourself. But for your husband, He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows The fits o’ th’ season. I dare not speak much	 further; But cruel are the times when we are traitors And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor From what we fear, yet know not what we fear, But float upon a wild and violent sea	 Each way and move—I take my leave of you. Shall not be long but I’ll be here again. Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward To what they were before.—My pretty cousin, Blessing upon you.	 

LADY MACDUFF Fathered he is, and yet he’s fatherless. 

ROSS I am so much a fool, should I stay longer It would be my disgrace and your discomfort. I take my leave at once.	 <ACTION>Ross exits.</ACTION> 

LADY MACDUFF Sirrah, your father’s dead.	 And what will you do now? How will you live? 

SON As birds do, mother. 

LADY MACDUFF What, with worms and flies? 

SON With what I get, I mean; and so do they. 

LADY MACDUFF Poor bird, thou ’dst never fear the net nor lime,	 The pitfall nor the gin. 

SON Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for. My father is not dead, for all your saying. 

LADY MACDUFF Yes, he is dead. How wilt thou do for a father?	 

SON Nay, how will you do for a husband? 

LADY MACDUFF Why, I can buy me twenty at any market. 

SON  Then you’ll buy ’em to sell again. 

LADY MACDUFF Thou speak’st with all thy wit, And yet, i’ faith, with wit enough for thee.	 

SON  Was my father a traitor, mother? 

LADY MACDUFF  Ay, that he was. 

SON What is a traitor? 

LADY MACDUFF Why, one that swears and lies. 

SON  And be all traitors that do so?	 

LADY MACDUFF  Every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged. 

SON And must they all be hanged that swear and lie? 

LADY MACDUFF Every one. 

SON  Who must hang them?	 

LADY MACDUFF Why, the honest men. 

SON Then the liars and swearers are fools, for there are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest men and hang up them. 

LADY MACDUFF  Now God help thee, poor monkey! But	 how wilt thou do for a father? 

SON If he were dead, you’d weep for him. If you would not, it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father. 

LADY MACDUFF Poor prattler, how thou talk’st!	 

<ACTION>Enter a Messenger.</ACTION> 

MESSENGER Bless you, fair dame. I am not to you known, Though in your state of honor I am perfect. I doubt some danger does approach you nearly. If you will take a homely man’s advice, Be not found here. Hence with your little ones!	 To fright you thus methinks I am too savage; To do worse to you were fell cruelty, Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you! I dare abide no longer.	 <ACTION>Messenger exits.  </ACTION> 

LADY MACDUFF Whither should I fly? I have done no harm. But I remember now I am in this earthly world, where to do harm Is often laudable, to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly. Why then, alas,	 Do I put up that womanly defense To say I have done no harm? 

<ACTION>Enter Murderers.</ACTION> 

What are these faces? 

MURDERER Where is your husband? 

LADY MACDUFF I hope in no place so unsanctified	 Where such as thou mayst find him. 

MURDERER  He’s a traitor. 

SON Thou liest, thou shag-eared villain! 

MURDERER What, you egg? <ACTION>Stabbing him. </ACTION> Young fry of treachery!	 

SON  He has killed me, mother. Run away, I pray you. 

<ACTION>Lady Macduff exits, crying “Murder!” followed by theMurderers bearing the Son’s body.</ACTION>
