KENT Here is the place, my lord. Good my lord, enter. The tyranny of the open night ’s too rough For nature to endure. <ACTION>	Storm still.</ACTION> 

LEAR Let me alone. 

KENT Good my lord, enter here.	 

LEAR  Wilt break my heart? 

KENT I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter. 

LEAR Thou think’st ’tis much that this contentious storm Invades us to the skin. So ’tis to thee. But where the greater malady is fixed,	 The lesser is scarce felt. Thou ’dst shun a bear, But if thy flight lay toward the roaring sea, Thou ’dst meet the bear i’ th’ mouth. When the mind’s free, The body’s delicate. This tempest in my mind	 Doth from my senses take all feeling else Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude! Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand For lifting food to ’t? But I will punish home. No, I will weep no more. In such a night	 To shut me out? Pour on. I will endure. In such a night as this? O Regan, Goneril, Your old kind father whose frank heart gave all! O, that way madness lies. Let me shun that; No more of that.	 

KENT Good my lord, enter here. 

LEAR Prithee, go in thyself. Seek thine own ease. This tempest will not give me leave to ponder On things would hurt me more. But I’ll go in.— In, boy; go first.—You houseless poverty—	 Nay, get thee in. I’ll pray, and then I’ll sleep. Fool exits. Poor naked wretches, wheresoe’er you are, That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm, How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides, Your looped and windowed raggedness defend	 you From seasons such as these? O, I have ta’en Too little care of this. Take physic, pomp. Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel, That thou may’st shake the superflux to them	 And show the heavens more just. 

EDGAR within  Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom! 

<ACTION>Enter Fool.</ACTION> 

FOOL Come not in here, nuncle; here’s a spirit. Help me, help me!	 

KENT Give me thy hand. Who’s there? 

FOOL A spirit, a spirit! He says his name’s Poor Tom. 

KENT What art thou that dost grumble there i’ th’ straw? Come forth. 

<ACTION>Enter Edgar in disguise.</ACTION> 

EDGAR Away. The foul fiend follows me. Through the	 sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind. Hum! Go to thy cold bed and warm thee. 

LEAR Didst thou give all to thy daughters? And art thou come to this? 

EDGAR Who gives anything to Poor Tom, whom the	 foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool, o’er bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow and halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge, made him proud of heart to ride on a bay trotting	 horse over four-inched bridges to course his own shadow for a traitor? Bless thy five wits! Tom’s a-cold. O, do de, do de, do de. Bless thee from whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Do Poor Tom some charity, whom the foul fiend vexes. There	 could I have him now, and there—and there again —and there. <ACTION>	Storm still.</ACTION> 

LEAR Has his daughters brought him to this pass?— Couldst thou save nothing? Wouldst thou give ’em all?		 

FOOL Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all shamed. 

LEAR Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air Hang fated o’er men’s faults light on thy daughters! 

KENT He hath no daughters, sir.	 

LEAR Death, traitor! Nothing could have subdued nature To such a lowness but his unkind daughters. Is it the fashion that discarded fathers Should have thus little mercy on their flesh? Judicious punishment! ’Twas this flesh begot	 Those pelican daughters. 

EDGAR Pillicock sat on Pillicock Hill. Alow, alow, loo, loo. 

FOOL This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.	 

EDGAR Take heed o’ th’ foul fiend. Obey thy parents, keep thy word’s justice, swear not, commit not with man’s sworn spouse, set not thy sweet heart on proud array. Tom’s a-cold. 

LEAR What hast thou been?	 

EDGAR A servingman, proud in heart and mind, that curled my hair, wore gloves in my cap, served the lust of my mistress’ heart and did the act of darkness with her, swore as many oaths as I spake words and broke them in the sweet face of heaven;	 one that slept in the contriving of lust and waked to do it. Wine loved I deeply, dice dearly, and in woman out-paramoured the Turk. False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in	 prey. Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy foot out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy pen from lenders’ books, and defy the foul fiend. Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind;	 says suum, mun, nonny. Dolphin my boy, boy, sessa! Let him trot by.	 <ACTION>Storm still.</ACTION> 

LEAR Thou wert better in a grave than to answer with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies.—Is man no more than this? Consider him well.—Thou	 ow’st the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha, here’s three on ’s are sophisticated. Thou art the thing itself; unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings!	 Come, unbutton here.	 <ACTION>Tearing off his clothes.</ACTION> 

FOOL Prithee, nuncle, be contented. ’Tis a naughty night to swim in. Now, a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher’s heart—a small spark, all the rest on ’s body cold.	 

<ACTION>Enter Gloucester, with a torch.</ACTION> 

Look, here comes a walking fire. 

EDGAR This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet. He begins at curfew and walks till the first cock. He gives the web and the pin, squints the eye, and makes the harelip, mildews the white wheat, and	 hurts the poor creature of earth. Swithold footed thrice the ’old, He met the nightmare and her ninefold, Bid her alight, And her troth plight,	 And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee. 

KENT  How fares your Grace? 

LEAR What’s he? 

KENT Who’s there? What is ’t you seek? 

GLOUCESTER What are you there? Your names?	 

EDGAR Poor Tom, that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the tadpole, the wall newt, and the water; that, in the fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages, eats cow dung for sallets, swallows the old rat and the ditch-dog, drinks the green mantle of	 the standing pool; who is whipped from tithing to tithing, and stocked, punished, and imprisoned; who hath had three suits to his back, six shirts to his body, Horse to ride, and weapon to wear;	 But mice and rats and such small deer Have been Tom’s food for seven long year. Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin! Peace, thou fiend! 

GLOUCESTER ,  <ACTION>to Lear</ACTION> What, hath your Grace no better company?	 

EDGAR The Prince of Darkness is a gentleman. Modo he’s called, and Mahu. 

GLOUCESTER , <ACTION> to Lear</ACTION> Our flesh and blood, my lord, is grown so vile That it doth hate what gets it. 

EDGAR Poor Tom’s a-cold.	 

GLOUCESTER ,  <ACTION>to Lear</ACTION> Go in with me. My duty cannot suffer T’ obey in all your daughters’ hard commands. Though their injunction be to bar my doors And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you, Yet have I ventured to come seek you out	 And bring you where both fire and food is ready. 

LEAR First let me talk with this philosopher. <ACTION>To Edgar.</ACTION> What is the cause of thunder? 

KENT Good my lord, take his offer; go into th’ house. 

LEAR I’ll talk a word with this same learnèd Theban.—	 What is your study? 

EDGAR How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin. 

LEAR Let me ask you one word in private. 

<ACTION>They talk aside.</ACTION> 

KENT ,  <ACTION>to Gloucester</ACTION> Importune him once more to go, my lord. His wits begin t’ unsettle.	 

GLOUCESTER Canst thou blame him? <ACTION>Storm still.</ACTION> His daughters seek his death. Ah, that good Kent! He said it would be thus, poor banished man. Thou sayest the King grows mad; I’ll tell thee, friend,	 I am almost mad myself. I had a son, Now outlawed from my blood. He sought my life But lately, very late. I loved him, friend, No father his son dearer. True to tell thee, The grief hath crazed my wits. What a night’s this!	 —I do beseech your Grace— 

LEAR O, cry you mercy, sir. <ACTION>To Edgar.</ACTION> Noble philosopher, your company. 

EDGAR Tom’s a-cold. 

GLOUCESTER ,  <ACTION>to Edgar</ACTION> In fellow, there, into th’ hovel. Keep thee warm.	 

LEAR  Come, let’s in all. 

KENT This way, my lord. 

LEAR ,  <ACTION>indicating Edgar</ACTION> With him. I will keep still with my philosopher. 

KENT , <ACTION> to Gloucester</ACTION> Good my lord, soothe him. Let him take the fellow.	 

GLOUCESTER ,  <ACTION>to Kent</ACTION> Take him you on. 

KENT ,  <ACTION>to Edgar</ACTION> Sirrah, come on: go along with us. 

LEAR  Come, good Athenian. 

GLOUCESTER No words, no words. Hush. 

EDGAR Child Rowland to the dark tower came.	 His word was still “Fie, foh, and fum, I smell the blood of a British man.” 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
