<ACTION>Flourish. Enter Lewis the French king, his sisterthe Lady Bona, his Admiral called Bourbon,Prince Edward, Queen Margaret, and the Earl of Oxford,the last three wearing the red rose.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Lewis sits, and riseth up again.</ACTION> 

KING LEWIS Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret, Sit down with us. It ill befits thy state And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit. 

QUEEN MARGARET No, mighty King of France. Now Margaret	 Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve Where kings command. I was, I must confess, Great Albion’s queen in former golden days, But now mischance hath trod my title down And with dishonor laid me on the ground,	 Where I must take like seat unto my fortune And to my humble seat conform myself. 

KING LEWIS Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair? 

QUEEN MARGARET From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears	 And stops my tongue, while heart is drowned in cares. 

KING LEWIS Whate’er it be, be thou still like thyself, And sit thee by our side.	Seats her by him. Yield not thy neck To Fortune’s yoke, but let thy dauntless mind	 Still ride in triumph over all mischance. Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief. It shall be eased if France can yield relief. 

QUEEN MARGARET Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.	 Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis That Henry, sole possessor of my love, Is, of a king, become a banished man And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn; While proud ambitious Edward, Duke of York,	 Usurps the regal title and the seat Of England’s true-anointed lawful king. This is the cause that I, poor Margaret, With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry’s heir, Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid; And if thou fail us, all our hope is done. Scotland hath will to help but cannot help; Our people and our peers are both misled, Our treasure seized, our soldiers put to flight, And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight. 

KING LEWIS Renownèd queen, with patience calm the storm While we bethink a means to break it off. 

QUEEN MARGARET The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe. 

KING LEWIS The more I stay, the more I’ll succor thee. 

QUEEN MARGARET O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.	 

<ACTION>Enter Warwick, wearing the white rose.</ACTION> 

And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow. 

KING LEWIS What’s he approacheth boldly to our presence? 

QUEEN MARGARET Our Earl of Warwick, Edward’s greatest friend. 

KING LEWIS ,  <ACTION>standing</ACTION> Welcome, brave Warwick. What brings thee to France? 

<ACTION>He descends. She ariseth.</ACTION> 

QUEEN MARGARET ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Ay, now begins a second storm to rise,	 For this is he that moves both wind and tide. 

WARWICK From worthy Edward, King of Albion, My lord and sovereign and thy vowèd friend, I come in kindness and unfeignèd love, First, to do greetings to thy royal person,	 And then to crave a league of amity, And, lastly, to confirm that amity With nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister, To England’s king in lawful marriage.	 

QUEEN MARGARET ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> If that go forward, Henry’s hope is done. 

WARWICK ,  <ACTION>speaking to Lady Bona</ACTION> And, gracious madam, in our king’s behalf, I am commanded, with your leave and favor, Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue To tell the passion of my sovereign’s heart,	 Where fame, late ent’ring at his heedful ears, Hath placed thy beauty’s image and thy virtue. 

QUEEN MARGARET King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak Before you answer Warwick. His demand Springs not from Edward’s well-meant honest love,	 But from deceit, bred by necessity; For how can tyrants safely govern home Unless abroad they purchase great alliance? To prove him tyrant, this reason may suffice: That Henry liveth still; but were he dead,	 Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry’s son. Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonor; For though usurpers sway the rule awhile, Yet heav’ns are just, and time suppresseth wrongs. 

WARWICK Injurious Margaret! 

PRINCE EDWARD And why not “Queen”? 

WARWICK Because thy father Henry did usurp, And thou no more art prince than she is queen.	 

OXFORD Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt, Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain; And after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth, Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest; And after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,	 Who by his prowess conquerèd all France. From these our Henry lineally descends. 

WARWICK Oxford, how haps it in this smooth discourse You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten.	 Methinks these peers of France should smile at that. But, for the rest: you tell a pedigree Of threescore and two years, a silly time To make prescription for a kingdom’s worth. 

OXFORD Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege, Whom thou obeyed’st thirty and six years, And not bewray thy treason with a blush? 

WARWICK Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right, Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree? For shame, leave Henry, and call Edward king.	 

OXFORD Call him my king, by whose injurious doom My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere, Was done to death? And more than so, my father, Even in the downfall of his mellowed years, When nature brought him to the door of death?	 No, Warwick, no. While life upholds this arm, This arm upholds the house of Lancaster. 

WARWICK And I the house of York. 

KING LEWIS Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford, Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside	 While I use further conference with Warwick. 

<ACTION>They stand aloof.</ACTION> 

QUEEN MARGARET ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Heavens grant that Warwick’s words bewitch him not. 

KING LEWIS Now, Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience, Is Edward your true king? For I were loath	 To link with him that were not lawful chosen. 

WARWICK Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honor. 

KING LEWIS But is he gracious in the people’s eye? 

WARWICK The more that Henry was unfortunate. 

KING LEWIS Then further, all dissembling set aside,	 Tell me for truth the measure of his love Unto our sister Bona. 

WARWICK Such it seems As may beseem a monarch like himself. Myself have often heard him say and swear	 That this his love was an eternal plant, Whereof the root was fixed in virtue’s ground, The leaves and fruit maintained with beauty’s sun, Exempt from envy but not from disdain, Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.	 

KING LEWIS Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve. 

LADY BONA Your grant or your denial shall be mine. <ACTION>(Speaks to Warwick.) </ACTION> Yet I confess that often ere this day, When I have heard your king’s desert recounted,	 Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire. 

KING LEWIS Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward’s. And now forthwith shall articles be drawn Touching the jointure that your king must make, Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.—	 Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness That Bona shall be wife to the English king. 

PRINCE EDWARD To Edward, but not to the English king. 

QUEEN MARGARET Deceitful Warwick, it was thy device By this alliance to make void my suit. Before thy coming, Lewis was Henry’s friend. 

KING LEWIS And still is friend to him and Margaret. But if your title to the crown be weak, As may appear by Edward’s good success, Then ’tis but reason that I be released	 From giving aid which late I promisèd. Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand That your estate requires and mine can yield. 

WARWICK Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease, Where, having nothing, nothing can he lose.—	 And as for you yourself, our quondam queen, You have a father able to maintain you, And better ’twere you troubled him than France. 

QUEEN MARGARET Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, Proud setter-up and puller-down of kings!	 I will not hence till with my talk and tears, Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold Thy sly conveyance and thy lord’s false love, For both of you are birds of selfsame feather. 

<ACTION>Post blowing a horn within.</ACTION> 

KING LEWIS Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.	 

<ACTION>Enter the Post.</ACTION> 

POST <ACTION>speaks to Warwick.</ACTION> My lord ambassador, these letters are for you, Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague. <ACTION>(To Lewis.) </ACTION> These from our king unto your Majesty. <ACTION>(To Margaret.)</ACTION> And, madam, these for you—from whom, I know not.	They all read their letters.   

OXFORD ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> I like it well that our fair queen and mistress Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his. 

PRINCE EDWARD ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Nay, mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled. I hope all’s for the best. 

KING LEWIS Warwick, what are thy news? And yours, fair queen?	 

QUEEN MARGARET Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys. 

WARWICK Mine, full of sorrow and heart’s discontent. 

KING LEWIS What, has your king married the Lady Grey, And now, to soothe your forgery and his, Sends me a paper to persuade me patience? Is this th’ alliance that he seeks with France? Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner? 

QUEEN MARGARET I told your Majesty as much before. This proveth Edward’s love and Warwick’s honesty. 

WARWICK King Lewis, I here protest in sight of heaven	 And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss, That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward’s— No more my king, for he dishonors me, But most himself, if he could see his shame. Did I forget that by the house of York	 My father came untimely to his death? Did I let pass th’ abuse done to my niece? Did I impale him with the regal crown? Did I put Henry from his native right? And am I guerdoned at the last with shame? Shame on himself, for my desert is honor! And to repair my honor lost for him, I here renounce him and return to Henry. 

<ACTION>He removes the white rose.</ACTION> 

My noble queen, let former grudges pass, And henceforth I am thy true servitor.	 I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona And replant Henry in his former state. 

QUEEN MARGARET Warwick, these words have turned my hate to love, And I forgive and quite forget old faults, And joy that thou becom’st King Henry’s friend.	 

WARWICK So much his friend, ay, his unfeignèd friend, That if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us With some few bands of chosen soldiers, I’ll undertake to land them on our coast And force the tyrant from his seat by war.	 ’Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him. And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me, He’s very likely now to fall from him For matching more for wanton lust than honor, Or than for strength and safety of our country.	 

LADY BONA Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged But by thy help to this distressèd queen? 

QUEEN MARGARET Renownèd prince, how shall poor Henry live Unless thou rescue him from foul despair? 

LADY BONA My quarrel and this English queen’s are one.	 

WARWICK And mine, fair Lady Bona, joins with yours. 

KING LEWIS And mine with hers and thine and Margaret’s. Therefore at last I firmly am resolved You shall have aid. 

QUEEN MARGARET Let me give humble thanks for all, at once.	 

KING LEWIS Then, England’s messenger, return in post, And tell false Edward, thy supposèd king, That Lewis of France is sending over maskers To revel it with him and his new bride. Thou seest what’s passed; go fear thy king withal.	 

LADY BONA Tell him, in hope he’ll prove a widower shortly, I wear the willow garland for his sake. 

QUEEN MARGARET Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside And I am ready to put armor on. 

WARWICK Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong, And therefore I’ll uncrown him ere ’t be long. There’s thy reward.	 <ACTION>Gives money.</ACTION> Be gone.	 <ACTION>Post exits.</ACTION> 

KING LEWIS But, Warwick, Thou and Oxford with five thousand men	 Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle; And as occasion serves, this noble queen And prince shall follow with a fresh supply. Yet ere thou go, but answer me one doubt: What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?	 

WARWICK This shall assure my constant loyalty: That if our queen and this young prince agree, I’ll join mine eldest daughter, and my joy, To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands. 

QUEEN MARGARET Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.	 Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous. Therefore, delay not; give thy hand to Warwick, And with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable, That only Warwick’s daughter shall be thine. 

PRINCE EDWARD Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it,	 And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand. 

<ACTION>He gives his hand to Warwick.</ACTION> 

KING LEWIS Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied, And thou, Lord Bourbon, our High Admiral, Shall waft them over with our royal fleet. I long till Edward fall by war’s mischance	 For mocking marriage with a dame of France. 

WARWICK I came from Edward as ambassador, But I return his sworn and mortal foe. Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me, But dreadful war shall answer his demand.	 Had he none else to make a stale but me? Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow. I was the chief that raised him to the crown, And I’ll be chief to bring him down again: Not that I pity Henry’s misery,	 But seek revenge on Edward’s mockery. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
