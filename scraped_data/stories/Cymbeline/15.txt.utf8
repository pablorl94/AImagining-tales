<ACTION>Enter Cymbeline, Queen, Cloten, Lucius, Lords, andAttendants.</ACTION> 

CYMBELINE Thus far, and so farewell. 

LUCIUS Thanks, royal sir. My emperor hath wrote I must from hence, And am right sorry that I must report you My master’s enemy.	 

CYMBELINE Our subjects, sir, Will not endure his yoke, and for ourself To show less sovereignty than they must needs Appear unkinglike. 

LUCIUS  So, sir. I desire of you	 A conduct overland to Milford Haven.— Madam, all joy befall your Grace—and you. 

CYMBELINE ,  <ACTION>to Lords</ACTION> My lords, you are appointed for that office. The due of honor in no point omit.— So, farewell, noble Lucius.	 

LUCIUS ,  <ACTION>to Cloten</ACTION> Your hand, my lord. 

CLOTEN Receive it friendly, but from this time forth I wear it as your enemy. 

LUCIUS Sir, the event Is yet to name the winner. Fare you well.	 

CYMBELINE Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords, Till he have crossed the Severn. Happiness! 

<ACTION>Exit Lucius and Lords.</ACTION> 

QUEEN He goes hence frowning, but it honors us That we have given him cause. 

CLOTEN  ’Tis all the better.	 Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it. 

CYMBELINE Lucius hath wrote already to the Emperor How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness. The powers that he already hath in Gallia	 Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves His war for Britain. 

QUEEN ’Tis not sleepy business, But must be looked to speedily and strongly. 

CYMBELINE Our expectation that it would be thus	 Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen, Where is our daughter? She hath not appeared Before the Roman, nor to us hath tendered The duty of the day. She looks us like A thing more made of malice than of duty.	 We have noted it.—Call her before us, for We have been too slight in sufferance. 

<ACTION>An Attendant exits.</ACTION> 

QUEEN  Royal sir, Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired Hath her life been, the cure whereof, my lord,	 ’Tis time must do. Beseech your Majesty, Forbear sharp speeches to her. She’s a lady So tender of rebukes that words are strokes And strokes death to her. 

<ACTION>Enter Attendant.</ACTION> 

CYMBELINE Where is she, sir? How	 Can her contempt be answered? 

ATTENDANT Please you, sir, Her chambers are all locked, and there’s no answer That will be given to th’ loud’st noise we make. 

QUEEN  My lord, when last I went to visit her,	 She prayed me to excuse her keeping close; Whereto constrained by her infirmity, She should that duty leave unpaid to you Which daily she was bound to proffer. This She wished me to make known, but our great court Made me to blame in memory. 

CYMBELINE Her doors locked? Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I Fear prove false!	He exits with Attendant. 

QUEEN Son, I say, follow the King.	 

CLOTEN That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant I have not seen these two days. 

QUEEN Go, look after. 

<ACTION>Cloten exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Aside.</ACTION> Pisanio, thou that stand’st so for Posthumus— He hath a drug of mine. I pray his absence	 Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes It is a thing most precious. But for her, Where is she gone? Haply despair hath seized her, Or, winged with fervor of her love, she’s flown To her desired Posthumus. Gone she is	 To death or to dishonor, and my end Can make good use of either. She being down, I have the placing of the British crown. 

<ACTION>Enter Cloten.</ACTION> 

How now, my son? 

CLOTEN ’Tis certain she is fled.	 Go in and cheer the King. He rages; none Dare come about him. 

QUEEN ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> All the better. May This night forestall him of the coming day! 

<ACTION>Queen exits, with Attendants.</ACTION> 

CLOTEN I love and hate her, for she’s fair and royal,	 And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite Than lady, ladies, woman. From every one The best she hath, and she, of all compounded, Outsells them all. I love her therefore, but Disdaining me and throwing favors on	 The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment That what’s else rare is choked. And in that point I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed, To be revenged upon her. For, when fools Shall—	 

<ACTION>Enter Pisanio.</ACTION> 

Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah? Come hither. Ah, you precious pander! Villain, Where is thy lady? In a word, or else Thou art straightway with the fiends. <ACTION>He draws his sword.</ACTION> 

PISANIO  O, good my lord—	 

CLOTEN Where is thy lady? Or, by Jupiter— I will not ask again. Close villain, I’ll have this secret from thy heart or rip Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus, From whose so many weights of baseness cannot	 A dram of worth be drawn? 

PISANIO Alas, my lord, How can she be with him? When was she missed? He is in Rome. 

CLOTEN Where is she, sir? Come nearer.	 No farther halting. Satisfy me home What is become of her. 

PISANIO O, my all-worthy lord! 

CLOTEN All-worthy villain! Discover where thy mistress is at once,	 At the next word. No more of “worthy lord”! Speak, or thy silence on the instant is Thy condemnation and thy death. 

PISANIO Then, sir, This paper is the history of my knowledge	 Touching her flight.	He gives Cloten a paper. 

CLOTEN  Let’s see ’t. I will pursue her Even to Augustus’ throne. 

PISANIO ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Or this or perish. She’s far enough, and what he learns by this	 May prove his travail, not her danger. 

CLOTEN Humh! 

PISANIO ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> I’ll write to my lord she’s dead. O Imogen, Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again! 

CLOTEN Sirrah, is this letter true?	 

PISANIO  Sir, as I think. 

CLOTEN  It is Posthumus’ hand, I know ’t. Sirrah, if thou wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service, undergo those employments wherein I should have cause to use thee with a serious industry— that is, what villainy soe’er I bid thee do to perform it directly and truly—I would think thee an honest man. Thou shouldst neither want my means for thy relief nor my voice for thy preferment. 

PISANIO Well, my good lord.	 

CLOTEN  Wilt thou serve me? For since patiently and constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not in the course of gratitude but be a diligent follower of mine. Wilt thou serve me?	 

PISANIO  Sir, I will. 

CLOTEN  Give me thy hand. Here’s my purse. Gives him money. Hast any of thy late master’s garments in thy possession? 

PISANIO  I have, my lord, at my lodging the same suit he	 wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress. 

CLOTEN The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit hither. Let it be thy first service. Go. 

PISANIO I shall, my lord.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

CLOTEN Meet thee at Milford Haven!—I forgot to ask	 him one thing; I’ll remember ’t anon. Even there, thou villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these garments were come. She said upon a time— the bitterness of it I now belch from my heart— that she held the very garment of Posthumus in	 more respect than my noble and natural person, together with the adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my back will I ravish her. First, kill him, and in her eyes. There shall she see my valor, which will then be a torment to her contempt.	 He on the ground, my speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and when my lust hath dined—which, as I say, to vex her I will execute in the clothes that she so praised—to the court I’ll knock her back, foot her home again. She hath	 despised me rejoicingly, and I’ll be merry in my revenge. 

<ACTION>Enter Pisanio with the clothes.</ACTION> 

Be those the garments? 

PISANIO   Ay, my noble lord. 

CLOTEN How long is ’t since she went to Milford Haven?	 

PISANIO She can scarce be there yet. 

CLOTEN Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second thing that I have commanded thee. The third is that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Be but duteous, and true preferment shall	 tender itself to thee. My revenge is now at Milford. Would I had wings to follow it! Come, and be true. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

PISANIO Thou bidd’st me to my loss, for true to thee Were to prove false, which I will never be, To him that is most true. To Milford go,	 And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow, You heavenly blessings, on her. This fool’s speed Be crossed with slowness. Labor be his meed. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
