<ACTION>Enter King and two or three.</ACTION> 

KING I have sent to seek him and to find the body. How dangerous is it that this man goes loose! Yet must not we put the strong law on him. He’s loved of the distracted multitude, Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;	 And, where ’tis so, th’ offender’s scourge is weighed, But never the offense. To bear all smooth and even, This sudden sending him away must seem Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown By desperate appliance are relieved	 Or not at all. 

<ACTION>Enter Rosencrantz.</ACTION> 

How now, what hath befallen? 

ROSENCRANTZ Where the dead body is bestowed, my lord, We cannot get from him. 

KING But where is he?	 

ROSENCRANTZ Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure. 

KING Bring him before us. 

ROSENCRANTZ  Ho! Bring in the lord. 

<ACTION>They enter with Hamlet.</ACTION> 

KING Now, Hamlet, where’s Polonius? 

HAMLET  At supper.	 

KING At supper where? 

HAMLET  Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain convocation of politic worms are e’en at him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves	 for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service—two dishes but to one table. That’s the end. 

KING Alas, alas! 

HAMLET A man may fish with the worm that hath eat	 of a king and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm. 

KING  What dost thou mean by this? 

HAMLET Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar.	 

KING Where is Polonius? 

HAMLET In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not there, seek him i’ th’ other place yourself. But if, indeed, you find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up	 the stairs into the lobby. 

KING ,  <ACTION>to Attendants.</ACTION> Go, seek him there. 

HAMLET He will stay till you come.	 <ACTION>Attendants exit.</ACTION> 

KING Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety (Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve	 For that which thou hast done) must send thee hence With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself. The bark is ready, and the wind at help, Th’ associates tend, and everything is bent	 For England. 

HAMLET For England? 

KING  Ay, Hamlet. 

HAMLET Good. 

KING So is it, if thou knew’st our purposes.	 

HAMLET I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England. Farewell, dear mother. 

KING Thy loving father, Hamlet. 

HAMLET My mother. Father and mother is man and wife,	 Man and wife is one flesh, and so, my mother.— Come, for England.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

KING Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard. Delay it not. I’ll have him hence tonight. Away, for everything is sealed and done	 That else leans on th’ affair. Pray you, make haste. 

<ACTION>All but the King exit.</ACTION> 

And England, if my love thou hold’st at aught (As my great power thereof may give thee sense, Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red After the Danish sword, and thy free awe	 Pays homage to us), thou mayst not coldly set Our sovereign process, which imports at full, By letters congruing to that effect, The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England, For like the hectic in my blood he rages,	 And thou must cure me. Till I know ’tis done, Howe’er my haps, my joys will ne’er begin. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
