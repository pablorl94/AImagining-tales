<ACTION>Sound retreat. Enter Agamemnon, Ajax, Menelaus,Nestor, Diomedes, and the rest, marching to the beat ofdrums. Shout within.</ACTION> 

AGAMEMNON Hark, hark, what shout is this? 

NESTOR Peace, drums!	The drums cease. 

SOLDIERS ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> Achilles! Achilles! Hector’s slain! Achilles! 

DIOMEDES The bruit is Hector’s slain, and by Achilles. 

AJAX If it be so, yet bragless let it be.	 Great Hector was as good a man as he. 

AGAMEMNON March patiently along. Let one be sent To pray Achilles see us at our tent. If in his death the gods have us befriended, Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.	 

<ACTION>They exit, marching.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Aeneas, Paris, Antenor, Deiphobus, and Trojansoldiers.</ACTION> 

AENEAS Stand, ho! Yet are we masters of the field. Never go home; here starve we out the night. 

<ACTION>Enter Troilus.</ACTION> 

TROILUS Hector is slain. 

ALL  Hector! The gods forbid! 

TROILUS He’s dead, and at the murderer’s horse’s tail,	 In beastly sort, dragged through the shameful field. Frown on, you heavens; effect your rage with speed. Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smite at Troy! I say at once: let your brief plagues be mercy, And linger not our sure destructions on!	 

AENEAS My lord, you do discomfort all the host. 

TROILUS You understand me not that tell me so. I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death, But dare all imminence that gods and men Address their dangers in. Hector is gone.	 Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba? Let him that will a screech-owl aye be called Go into Troy and say their Hector’s dead. There is a word will Priam turn to stone, Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives, Cold statues of the youth and, in a word, Scare Troy out of itself. But march away. Hector is dead. There is no more to say. Stay yet. You vile abominable tents, Thus proudly pitched upon our Phrygian plains,	 Let Titan rise as early as he dare, I’ll through and through you! And, thou great-sized coward, No space of earth shall sunder our two hates. I’ll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,	 That moldeth goblins swift as frenzy’s thoughts. Strike a free march to Troy! With comfort go. Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe. 

<ACTION>Enter Pandarus.</ACTION> 

PANDARUS But hear you, hear you! 

TROILUS Hence, broker, lackey! Ignomy and shame	 Pursue thy life, and live aye with thy name! 

<ACTION>All but Pandarus exit.</ACTION> 

PANDARUS  A goodly medicine for my aching bones! O world, world, world! Thus is the poor agent despised. O traitors and bawds, how earnestly are you set a-work, and how ill requited! Why should	 our endeavor be so loved and the performance so loathed? What verse for it? What instance for it? Let me see: Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing, Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;	 And being once subdued in armèd tail, Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail. Good traders in the flesh, set this in your painted cloths: As many as be here of panders’ hall,	 Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar’s fall; Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans, Though not for me, yet for your aching bones. Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade, Some two months hence my will shall here be made.	 It should be now, but that my fear is this: Some gallèd goose of Winchester would hiss. Till then I’ll sweat and seek about for eases, And at that time bequeath you my diseases. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
