<ACTION>Flourish. Enter the Duke of Florence, the two FrenchLords, with a troop of Soldiers.</ACTION> 

DUKE So that from point to point now have you heard The fundamental reasons of this war, Whose great decision hath much blood let forth And more thirsts after. 

FIRST LORD  Holy seems the quarrel	 Upon your Grace’s part, black and fearful On the opposer. 

DUKE Therefore we marvel much our cousin France Would in so just a business shut his bosom Against our borrowing prayers.	 

SECOND LORD Good my lord, The reasons of our state I cannot yield But like a common and an outward man That the great figure of a council frames By self-unable motion; therefore dare not	 Say what I think of it, since I have found Myself in my incertain grounds to fail As often as I guessed. 

DUKE Be it his pleasure. 

FIRST LORD But I am sure the younger of our nation,	 That surfeit on their ease, will day by day Come here for physic. 

DUKE  Welcome shall they be, And all the honors that can fly from us Shall on them settle. You know your places well.	 When better fall, for your avails they fell. Tomorrow to th’ field. 

<ACTION>Flourish. They exit.</ACTION>
