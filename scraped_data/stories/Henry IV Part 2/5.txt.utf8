<ACTION>Enter the Prince and Poins.</ACTION> 

PRINCE Before God, I am exceeding weary. 

POINS Is ’t come to that? I had thought weariness durst not have attached one of so high blood. 

PRINCE Faith, it does me, though it discolors the complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth it	 not show vilely in me to desire small beer? 

POINS  Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a composition. 

PRINCE Belike then my appetite was not princely got, for, by my troth, I do now remember the poor	 creature small beer. But indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name, or to know thy face tomorrow, or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast—with these,	 and those that were thy peach-colored ones—or to bear the inventory of thy shirts, as, one for superfluity and another for use. But that the tennis-court keeper knows better than I, for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there,	 as thou hast not done a great while, because the rest of the low countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland; and God knows whether those that bawl out the ruins of thy linen shall inherit His kingdom; but the midwives say the children are not in the	 fault, whereupon the world increases and kindreds are mightily strengthened. 

POINS How ill it follows, after you have labored so hard, you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good young princes would do so, their fathers being	 so sick as yours at this time is? 

PRINCE  Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins? 

POINS Yes, faith, and let it be an excellent good thing. 

PRINCE It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.	 

POINS Go to. I stand the push of your one thing that you will tell. 

PRINCE  Marry, I tell thee it is not meet that I should be sad, now my father is sick—albeit I could tell to thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a better, to	 call my friend, I could be sad, and sad indeed too. 

POINS Very hardly, upon such a subject. 

PRINCE By this hand, thou thinkest me as far in the devil’s book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency. Let the end try the man. But I tell thee,	 my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick; and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow. 

POINS   The reason? 

PRINCE What wouldst thou think of me if I should	 weep? 

POINS I would think thee a most princely hypocrite. 

PRINCE It would be every man’s thought, and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks. Never a man’s thought in the world keeps the roadway better than thine. Every man would think me an hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most worshipful thought to think so? 

POINS Why, because you have been so lewd and so much engraffed to Falstaff.	 

PRINCE And to thee. 

POINS By this light, I am well spoke on. I can hear it with mine own ears. The worst that they can say of me is that I am a second brother, and that I am a proper fellow of my hands; and those two things, I	 confess, I cannot help. By the Mass, here comes Bardolph. 

<ACTION>Enter Bardolph and Page.</ACTION> 

PRINCE  And the boy that I gave Falstaff. He had him from me Christian, and look if the fat villain have not transformed him ape.	 

BARDOLPH God save your Grace. 

PRINCE And yours, most noble Bardolph. 

POINS ,  <ACTION>to Bardolph </ACTION> Come, you virtuous ass, you bashful fool, must you be blushing? Wherefore blush you now? What a maidenly man-at-arms are you	 become! Is ’t such a matter to get a pottle-pot’s maidenhead? 

PAGE He calls me e’en now, my lord, through a red lattice, and I could discern no part of his face from the window. At last I spied his eyes, and methought	80 he had made two holes in the ale-wife’s new petticoat and so peeped through. 

PRINCE Has not the boy profited? 

BARDOLPH ,  <ACTION>to Page</ACTION> Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!	 

PAGE Away, you rascally Althea’s dream, away! 

PRINCE  Instruct us, boy. What dream, boy? 

PAGE Marry, my lord, Althea dreamt she was delivered of a firebrand, and therefore I call him her dream. 

PRINCE  A crown’s worth of good interpretation. There	 ’tis, boy.	 

<ACTION>He gives the Page money.</ACTION> 

POINS O, that this good blossom could be kept from cankers! Well, there is sixpence to preserve thee. 

<ACTION>He gives the Page money.</ACTION> 

BARDOLPH An you do not make him be hanged among you, the gallows shall have wrong.	 

PRINCE   And how doth thy master, Bardolph? 

BARDOLPH Well, my good lord. He heard of your Grace’s coming to town. There’s a letter for you. 

<ACTION>He gives the Prince a paper.</ACTION> 

POINS Delivered with good respect. And how doth the Martlemas your master?	 

BARDOLPH   In bodily health, sir. 

POINS Marry, the immortal part needs a physician, but that moves not him. Though that be sick, it dies not. 

PRINCE  I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my dog, and he holds his place, for look you how he	 writes.	 <ACTION>He shows the letter to Poins.</ACTION> 

POINS <ACTION>reads the superscription  John Falstaff, knight</ACTION> . Every man must know that as oft as he has occasion to name himself, even like those that are kin to the King, for they never prick their finger but they say	 “There’s some of the King’s blood spilt.” “How comes that?” says he that takes upon him not to conceive. The answer is as ready as a borrower’s cap: “I am the King’s poor cousin, sir.” 

PRINCE  Nay, they will be kin to us, or they will fetch it	 from Japheth. But to the letter:  <ACTION>Reads.</ACTION> <ACTION>Sir JohnFalstaff, knight, to the son of the King nearest hisfather, Harry Prince of Wales, greeting.</ACTION> 

POINS Why, this is a certificate. 

PRINCE Peace!	 

<ACTION>Reads. I will imitate the honorable Romans inbrevity.</ACTION> 

POINS He sure means brevity in breath, short-winded. 

PRINCE <ACTION>reads  I commend me to thee, I commend thee,and I leave thee. Be not too familiar with Poins, for he	misuses thy favors so much that he swears thou art tomarry his sister Nell. Repent at idle times as thoumayst, and so farewell.</ACTION> <ACTION>Thine by yea and no, which is as much asto say, as thou usest him,	Jack Falstaff with my familiars,John with my brothers and sisters, andSir John with all Europe.</ACTION> 

POINS  My lord, I’ll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it.	 

PRINCE That’s to make him eat twenty of his words. But do you use me thus, Ned? Must I marry your sister? 

POINS God send the wench no worse fortune! But I never said so.	 

PRINCE  Well, thus we play the fools with the time, and the spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us. To Bardolph. Is your master here in London? 

BARDOLPH Yea, my lord. 

PRINCE Where sups he? Doth the old boar feed in the	145 old frank? 

BARDOLPH  At the old place, my lord, in Eastcheap. 

PRINCE   What company? 

PAGE Ephesians, my lord, of the old church. 

PRINCE   Sup any women with him?	 

PAGE None, my lord, but old Mistress Quickly and Mistress Doll Tearsheet.

PRINCE  What pagan may that be? 

PAGE   A proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my master’s.	 

PRINCE Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town bull.—Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper? 

POINS  I am your shadow, my lord. I’ll follow you. 

PRINCE  Sirrah—you, boy—and Bardolph, no word to	 your master that I am yet come to town. There’s for your silence.	 <ACTION>He gives money.</ACTION> 

BARDOLPH I have no tongue, sir. 

PAGE And for mine, sir, I will govern it. 

PRINCE Fare you well. Go.	Bardolph and Page exit.   This Doll Tearsheet should be some road. 

POINS I warrant you, as common as the way between Saint Albans and London. 

PRINCE How might we see Falstaff bestow himself tonight in his true colors, and not ourselves be seen? 

POINS Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons, and wait upon him at his table as drawers. 

PRINCE From a god to a bull: a heavy descension. It was Jove’s case. From a prince to a ’prentice: a low	 transformation that shall be mine, for in everything the purpose must weigh with the folly. Follow me, Ned. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
