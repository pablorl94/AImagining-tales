<ACTION>Enter Rosalind, dressed as Ganymede, and Celia,dressed as Aliena.</ACTION> 

ROSALIND Never talk to me. I will weep. 

CELIA Do, I prithee, but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man. 

ROSALIND But have I not cause to weep? 

CELIA As good cause as one would desire. Therefore	 weep. 

ROSALIND His very hair is of the dissembling color. 

CELIA  Something browner than Judas’s. Marry, his kisses are Judas’s own children. 

ROSALIND I’ faith, his hair is of a good color.	 

CELIA  An excellent color. Your chestnut was ever the only color. 

ROSALIND And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread. 

CELIA He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A	 nun of winter’s sisterhood kisses not more religiously. The very ice of chastity is in them. 

ROSALIND But why did he swear he would come this morning, and comes not? 

CELIA Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.	 

ROSALIND  Do you think so? 

CELIA  Yes, I think he is not a pickpurse nor a horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as a covered goblet or a worm-eaten nut. 

ROSALIND Not true in love?	 

CELIA Yes, when he is in, but I think he is not in. 

ROSALIND You have heard him swear downright he was. 

CELIA “Was” is not “is.” Besides, the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster. They are	 both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends here in the forest on the Duke your father. 

ROSALIND I met the Duke yesterday and had much question with him. He asked me of what parentage I was. I told him, of as good as he. So he laughed	 and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando? 

CELIA  O, that’s a brave man. He writes brave verses, speaks brave words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of	 his lover, as a puny tilter that spurs his horse but on one side breaks his staff like a noble goose; but all’s brave that youth mounts and folly guides. 

<ACTION>Enter Corin.</ACTION> 

Who comes here? 

CORIN Mistress and master, you have oft inquired	 After the shepherd that complained of love, Who you saw sitting by me on the turf, Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess That was his mistress. 

CELIA , <ACTION> as Aliena</ACTION> Well, and what of him?	 

CORIN If you will see a pageant truly played Between the pale complexion of true love And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain, Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you If you will mark it.	 

ROSALIND , <ACTION> aside to Celia</ACTION> O come, let us remove. The sight of lovers feedeth those in love. <ACTION>As Ganymede, to Corin.</ACTION> Bring us to this sight, and you shall say I’ll prove a busy actor in their play.	 

They exit.
