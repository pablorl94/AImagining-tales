Part Second 

AT CHRISTMINSTER 

"Save his own soul he hath no star."--SWINBURNE. 

"Notitiam primosque gradus vicinia fecit; Tempore crevit amor."--OVID. 

I 

The next noteworthy move in Jude's life was that in which he appeared gliding steadily onward through a dusky landscape of some three years' later leafage than had graced his courtship of Arabella, and the disruption of his coarse conjugal life with her.  He was walking towards Christminster City, at a point a mile or two to the south-west of it. 

He had at last found himself clear of Marygreen and Alfredston: he was out of his apprenticeship, and with his tools at his back seemed to be in the way of making a new start--the start to which, barring the interruption involved in his intimacy and married experience with Arabella, he had been looking forward for about ten years. 

Jude would now have been described as a young man with a forcible, meditative, and earnest rather than handsome cast of countenance. He was of dark complexion, with dark harmonizing eyes, and he wore a closely trimmed black beard of more advanced growth than is usual at his age; this, with his great mass of black curly hair, was some trouble to him in combing and washing out the stone-dust that settled on it in the pursuit of his trade.  His capabilities in the latter, having been acquired in the country, were of an all-round sort, including monumental stone-cutting, gothic free-stone work for the restoration of churches, and carving of a general kind.  In London he would probably have become specialized and have made himself a "moulding mason," a "foliage sculptor"--perhaps a "statuary." 

He had that afternoon driven in a cart from Alfredston to the village nearest the city in this direction, and was now walking the remaining four miles rather from choice than from necessity, having always fancied himself arriving thus. 

The ultimate impulse to come had had a curious origin--one more nearly related to the emotional side of him than to the intellectual, as is often the case with young men.  One day while in lodgings at Alfredston he had gone to Marygreen to see his old aunt, and had observed between the brass candlesticks on her mantlepiece the photograph of a pretty girlish face, in a broad hat with radiating folds under the brim like the rays of a halo.  He had asked who she was.  His grand-aunt had gruffly replied that she was his cousin Sue Bridehead, of the inimical branch of the family; and on further questioning the old woman had replied that the girl lived in Christminster, though she did not know where, or what she was doing. 

His aunt would not give him the photograph.  But it haunted him; and ultimately formed a quickening ingredient in his latent intent of following his friend the school master thither. 

He now paused at the top of a crooked and gentle declivity, and obtained his first near view of the city.  Grey-stoned and dun-roofed, it stood within hail of the Wessex border, and almost with the tip of one small toe within it, at the northernmost point of the crinkled line along which the leisurely Thames strokes the fields of that ancient kingdom.  The buildings now lay quiet in the sunset, a vane here and there on their many spires and domes giving sparkle to a picture of sober secondary and tertiary hues. 

Reaching the bottom he moved along the level way between pollard willows growing indistinct in the twilight, and soon confronted the outmost lamps of the town--some of those lamps which had sent into the sky the gleam and glory that caught his strained gaze in his days of dreaming, so many years ago.  They winked their yellow eyes at him dubiously, and as if, though they had been awaiting him all these years in disappointment at his tarrying, they did not much want him now. 

He was a species of Dick Whittington whose spirit was touched to finer issues than a mere material gain.  He went along the outlying streets with the cautious tread of an explorer.  He saw nothing of the real city in the suburbs on this side.  His first want being a lodging he scrutinized carefully such localities as seemed to offer on inexpensive terms the modest type of accommodation he demanded; and after inquiry took a room in a suburb nicknamed "Beersheba," though he did not know this at the time.  Here he installed himself, and having had some tea sallied forth. 

It was a windy, whispering, moonless night.  To guide himself he opened under a lamp a map he had brought.  The breeze ruffled and fluttered it, but he could see enough to decide on the direction he should take to reach the heart of the place. 

After many turnings he came up to the first ancient mediæval pile that he had encountered.  It was a college, as he could see by the gateway.  He entered it, walked round, and penetrated to dark corners which no lamplight reached.  Close to this college was another; and a little further on another; and then he began to be encircled as it were with the breath and sentiment of the venerable city.  When he passed objects out of harmony with its general expression he allowed his eyes to slip over them as if he did not see them. 

A bell began clanging, and he listened till a hundred-and-one strokes had sounded.  He must have made a mistake, he thought: it was meant for a hundred. 

When the gates were shut, and he could no longer get into the quadrangles, he rambled under the walls and doorways, feeling with his fingers the contours of their mouldings and carving.  The minutes passed, fewer and fewer people were visible, and still he serpentined among the shadows, for had he not imagined these scenes through ten bygone years, and what mattered a night's rest for once?  High against the black sky the flash of a lamp would show crocketed pinnacles and indented battlements.  Down obscure alleys, apparently never trodden now by the foot of man, and whose very existence seemed to be forgotten, there would jut into the path porticoes, oriels, doorways of enriched and florid middle-age design, their extinct air being accentuated by the rottenness of the stones.  It seemed impossible that modern thought could house itself in such decrepit and superseded chambers. 

Knowing not a human being here, Jude began to be impressed with the isolation of his own personality, as with a self-spectre, the sensation being that of one who walked but could not make himself seen or heard.  He drew his breath pensively, and, seeming thus almost his own ghost, gave his thoughts to the other ghostly presences with which the nooks were haunted. 

During the interval of preparation for this venture, since his wife and furniture's uncompromising disappearance into space, he had read and learnt almost all that could be read and learnt by one in his position, of the worthies who had spent their youth within these reverend walls, and whose souls had haunted them in their maturer age.  Some of them, by the accidents of his reading, loomed out in his fancy disproportionately large by comparison with the rest.  The brushings of the wind against the angles, buttresses, and door-jambs were as the passing of these only other inhabitants, the tappings of each ivy leaf on its neighbour were as the mutterings of their mournful souls, the shadows as their thin shapes in nervous movement, making him comrades in his solitude.  In the gloom it was as if he ran against them without feeling their bodily frames. 

The streets were now deserted, but on account of these things he could not go in.  There were poets abroad, of early date and of late, from the friend and eulogist of Shakespeare down to him who has recently passed into silence, and that musical one of the tribe who is still among us.  Speculative philosophers drew along, not always with wrinkled foreheads and hoary hair as in framed portraits, but pink-faced, slim, and active as in youth; modern divines sheeted in their surplices, among whom the most real to Jude Fawley were the founders of the religious school called Tractarian; the well-known three, the enthusiast, the poet, and the formularist, the echoes of whose teachings had influenced him even in his obscure home. A start of aversion appeared in his fancy to move them at sight of those other sons of the place, the form in the full-bottomed wig, statesman, rake, reasoner, and sceptic; the smoothly shaven historian so ironically civil to Christianity; with others of the same incredulous temper, who knew each quad as well as the faithful, and took equal freedom in haunting its cloisters. 

He regarded the statesmen in their various types, men of firmer movement and less dreamy air; the scholar, the speaker, the plodder; the man whose mind grew with his growth in years, and the man whose mind contracted with the same. 

The scientists and philologists followed on in his mind-sight in an odd impossible combination, men of meditative faces, strained foreheads, and weak-eyed as bats with constant research; then official characters--such men as governor-generals and lord-lieutenants, in whom he took little interest; chief-justices and lord chancellors, silent thin-lipped figures of whom he knew barely the names.  A keener regard attached to the prelates, by reason of his own former hopes.  Of them he had an ample band--some men of heart, others rather men of head; he who apologized for the Church in Latin; the saintly author of the Evening Hymn; and near them the great itinerant preacher, hymn-writer, and zealot, shadowed like Jude by his matrimonial difficulties. 

Jude found himself speaking out loud, holding conversations with them as it were, like an actor in a melodrama who apostrophizes the audience on the other side of the footlights; till he suddenly ceased with a start at his absurdity.  Perhaps those incoherent words of the wanderer were heard within the walls by some student or thinker over his lamp; and he may have raised his head, and wondered what voice it was, and what it betokened.  Jude now perceived that, so far as solid flesh went, he had the whole aged city to himself with the exception of a belated townsman here and there, and that he seemed to be catching a cold. 

A voice reached him out of the shade; a real and local voice: 

"You've been a-settin' a long time on that plinth-stone, young man. What med you be up to?" 

It came from a policeman who had been observing Jude without the latter observing him. 

Jude went home and to bed, after reading up a little about these men and their several messages to the world from a book or two that he had brought with him concerning the sons of the university.  As he drew towards sleep various memorable words of theirs that he had just been conning seemed spoken by them in muttering utterances; some audible, some unintelligible to him.  One of the spectres (who afterwards mourned Christminster as "the home of lost causes," though Jude did not remember this) was now apostrophizing her thus: 

"Beautiful city! so venerable, so lovely, so unravaged by the fierce intellectual life of our century, so serene! ...  Her ineffable charm keeps ever calling us to the true goal of all of us, to the ideal, to perfection." 

Another voice was that of the Corn Law convert, whose phantom he had just seen in the quadrangle with a great bell.  Jude thought his soul might have been shaping the historic words of his master-speech: 

"Sir, I may be wrong, but my impression is that my duty towards a country threatened with famine requires that that which has been the ordinary remedy under all similar circumstances should be resorted to now, namely, that there should be free access to the food of man from whatever quarter it may come...  Deprive me of office to-morrow, you can never deprive me of the consciousness that I have exercised the powers committed to me from no corrupt or interested motives, from no desire to gratify ambition, for no personal gain." 

Then the sly author of the immortal Chapter on Christianity: "How shall we excuse the supine inattention of the Pagan and philosophic world, to those evidences [miracles] which were presented by Omnipotence? ...  The sages of Greece and Rome turned aside from the awful spectacle, and appeared unconscious of any alterations in the moral or physical government of the world." 

Then the shade of the poet, the last of the optimists: 

How the world is made for each of us! 

*     *     *     *     * 

And each of the Many helps to recruit The life of the race by a general plan. 

Then one of the three enthusiasts he had seen just now, the author of the _Apologia_: 

"My argument was ... that absolute certitude as to the truths of natural theology was the result of an assemblage of concurring and converging probabilities ... that probabilities which did not reach to logical certainty might create a mental certitude." 

The second of them, no polemic, murmured quieter things: 

Why should we faint, and fear to live alone, Since all alone, so Heaven has will'd, we die? 

He likewise heard some phrases spoken by the phantom with the short face, the genial Spectator: 

"When I look upon the tombs of the great, every motion of envy dies in me; when I read the epitaphs of the beautiful, every inordinate desire goes out; when I meet with the grief of parents upon a tombstone, my heart melts with compassion; when I see the tombs of the parents themselves, I consider the vanity of grieving for those whom we must quickly follow." 

And lastly a gentle-voiced prelate spoke, during whose meek, familiar rhyme, endeared to him from earliest childhood, Jude fell asleep: 

Teach me to live, that I may dread The grave as little as my bed. Teach me to die ... 

He did not wake till morning.  The ghostly past seemed to have gone, and everything spoke of to-day.  He started up in bed, thinking he had overslept himself and then said: 

"By Jove--I had quite forgotten my sweet-faced cousin, and that she's here all the time! ... and my old schoolmaster, too."  His words about his schoolmaster had, perhaps, less zest in them than his words concerning his cousin. 

II 

Necessary meditations on the actual, including the mean bread-and-cheese question, dissipated the phantasmal for a while, and compelled Jude to smother high thinkings under immediate needs.  He had to get up, and seek for work, manual work; the only kind deemed by many of its professors to be work at all. 

Passing out into the streets on this errand he found that the colleges had treacherously changed their sympathetic countenances: some were pompous; some had put on the look of family vaults above ground; something barbaric loomed in the masonries of all.  The spirits of the great men had disappeared. 

The numberless architectural pages around him he read, naturally, less as an artist-critic of their forms than as an artizan and comrade of the dead handicraftsmen whose muscles had actually executed those forms.  He examined the mouldings, stroked them as one who knew their beginning, said they were difficult or easy in the working, had taken little or much time, were trying to the arm, or convenient to the tool. 

What at night had been perfect and ideal was by day the more or less defective real.  Cruelties, insults, had, he perceived, been inflicted on the aged erections.  The condition of several moved him as he would have been moved by maimed sentient beings.  They were wounded, broken, sloughing off their outer shape in the deadly struggle against years, weather, and man. 

The rottenness of these historical documents reminded him that he was not, after all, hastening on to begin the morning practically as he had intended.  He had come to work, and to live by work, and the morning had nearly gone.  It was, in one sense, encouraging to think that in a place of crumbling stones there must be plenty for one of his trade to do in the business of renovation.  He asked his way to the workyard of the stone-mason whose name had been given him at Alfredston; and soon heard the familiar sound of the rubbers and chisels. 

The yard was a little centre of regeneration.  Here, with keen edges and smooth curves, were forms in the exact likeness of those he had seen abraded and time-eaten on the walls.  These were the ideas in modern prose which the lichened colleges presented in old poetry. Even some of those antiques might have been called prose when they were new.  They had done nothing but wait, and had become poetical. How easy to the smallest building; how impossible to most men. 

He asked for the foreman, and looked round among the new traceries, mullions, transoms, shafts, pinnacles, and battlements standing on the bankers half worked, or waiting to be removed.  They were marked by precision, mathematical straightness, smoothness, exactitude: there in the old walls were the broken lines of the original idea; jagged curves, disdain of precision, irregularity, disarray. 

For a moment there fell on Jude a true illumination; that here in the stone yard was a centre of effort as worthy as that dignified by the name of scholarly study within the noblest of the colleges.  But he lost it under stress of his old idea.  He would accept any employment which might be offered him on the strength of his late employer's recommendation; but he would accept it as a provisional thing only. This was his form of the modern vice of unrest. 

Moreover he perceived that at best only copying, patching and imitating went on here; which he fancied to be owing to some temporary and local cause.  He did not at that time see that mediævalism was as dead as a fern-leaf in a lump of coal; that other developments were shaping in the world around him, in which Gothic architecture and its associations had no place.  The deadly animosity of contemporary logic and vision towards so much of what he held in reverence was not yet revealed to him. 

Having failed to obtain work here as yet he went away, and thought again of his cousin, whose presence somewhere at hand he seemed to feel in wavelets of interest, if not of emotion.  How he wished he had that pretty portrait of her!  At last he wrote to his aunt to send it.  She did so, with a request, however, that he was not to bring disturbance into the family by going to see the girl or her relations.  Jude, a ridiculously affectionate fellow, promised nothing, put the photograph on the mantel-piece, kissed it--he did not know why--and felt more at home.  She seemed to look down and preside over his tea.  It was cheering--the one thing uniting him to the emotions of the living city. 

There remained the schoolmaster--probably now a reverend parson. But he could not possibly hunt up such a respectable man just yet; so raw and unpolished was his condition, so precarious were his fortunes.  Thus he still remained in loneliness.  Although people moved round him he virtually saw none.  Not as yet having mingled with the active life of the place it was largely non-existent to him. But the saints and prophets in the window-tracery, the paintings in the galleries, the statues, the busts, the gargoyles, the corbel-heads--these seemed to breathe his atmosphere.  Like all newcomers to a spot on which the past is deeply graven he heard that past announcing itself with an emphasis altogether unsuspected by, and even incredible to, the habitual residents. 

For many days he haunted the cloisters and quadrangles of the colleges at odd minutes in passing them, surprised by impish echoes of his own footsteps, smart as the blows of a mallet.  The Christminster "sentiment," as it had been called, ate further and further into him; till he probably knew more about those buildings materially, artistically, and historically, than any one of their inmates. 

It was not till now, when he found himself actually on the spot of his enthusiasm, that Jude perceived how far away from the object of that enthusiasm he really was.  Only a wall divided him from those happy young contemporaries of his with whom he shared a common mental life; men who had nothing to do from morning till night but to read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest.  Only a wall--but what a wall! 

Every day, every hour, as he went in search of labour, he saw them going and coming also, rubbed shoulders with them, heard their voices, marked their movements.  The conversation of some of the more thoughtful among them seemed oftentimes, owing to his long and persistent preparation for this place, to be peculiarly akin to his own thoughts.  Yet he was as far from them as if he had been at the antipodes.  Of course he was.  He was a young workman in a white blouse, and with stone-dust in the creases of his clothes; and in passing him they did not even see him, or hear him, rather saw through him as through a pane of glass at their familiars beyond. Whatever they were to him, he to them was not on the spot at all; and yet he had fancied he would be close to their lives by coming there. 

But the future lay ahead after all; and if he could only be so fortunate as to get into good employment he would put up with the inevitable.  So he thanked God for his health and strength, and took courage.  For the present he was outside the gates of everything, colleges included: perhaps some day he would be inside.  Those palaces of light and leading; he might some day look down on the world through their panes. 

At length he did receive a message from the stone-mason's yard--that a job was waiting for him.  It was his first encouragement, and he closed with the offer promptly. 

He was young and strong, or he never could have executed with such zest the undertakings to which he now applied himself, since they involved reading most of the night after working all the day.  First he bought a shaded lamp for four and six-pence, and obtained a good light.  Then he got pens, paper, and such other necessary books as he had been unable to obtain elsewhere.  Then, to the consternation of his landlady, he shifted all the furniture of his room--a single one for living and sleeping--rigged up a curtain on a rope across the middle, to make a double chamber out of one, hung up a thick blind that nobody should know how he was curtailing the hours of sleep, laid out his books, and sat down. 

Having been deeply encumbered by marrying, getting a cottage, and buying the furniture which had disappeared in the wake of his wife, he had never been able to save any money since the time of those disastrous ventures, and till his wages began to come in he was obliged to live in the narrowest way.  After buying a book or two he could not even afford himself a fire; and when the nights reeked with the raw and cold air from the Meadows he sat over his lamp in a great-coat, hat, and woollen gloves. 

From his window he could perceive the spire of the cathedral, and the ogee dome under which resounded the great bell of the city.  The tall tower, tall belfry windows, and tall pinnacles of the college by the bridge he could also get a glimpse of by going to the staircase. These objects he used as stimulants when his faith in the future was dim. 

Like enthusiasts in general he made no inquiries into details of procedure.  Picking up general notions from casual acquaintance, he never dwelt upon them.  For the present, he said to himself, the one thing necessary was to get ready by accumulating money and knowledge, and await whatever chances were afforded to such an one of becoming a son of the University.  "For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence; but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it."  His desire absorbed him, and left no part of him to weigh its practicability. 

At this time he received a nervously anxious letter from his poor old aunt, on the subject which had previously distressed her--a fear that Jude would not be strong-minded enough to keep away from his cousin Sue Bridehead and her relations.  Sue's father, his aunt believed, had gone back to London, but the girl remained at Christminster.  To make her still more objectionable, she was an artist or designer of some sort in what was called an ecclesiastical warehouse, which was a perfect seed-bed of idolatry, and she was no doubt abandoned to mummeries on that account--if not quite a Papist. (Miss Drusilla Fawley was of her date, Evangelical.) 

As Jude was rather on an intellectual track than a theological, this news of Sue's probable opinions did not much influence him one way or the other, but the clue to her whereabouts was decidedly interesting. With an altogether singular pleasure he walked at his earliest spare minutes past the shops answering to his great-aunt's description; and beheld in one of them a young girl sitting behind a desk, who was suspiciously like the original of the portrait. He ventured to enter on a trivial errand, and having made his purchase lingered on the scene. The shop seemed to be kept entirely by women. It contained Anglican books, stationery, texts, and fancy goods: little plaster angels on brackets, Gothic-framed pictures of saints, ebony crosses that were almost crucifixes, prayer-books that were almost missals. He felt very shy of looking at the girl in the desk; she was so pretty that he could not believe it possible that she should belong to him. Then she spoke to one of the two older women behind the counter; and he recognized in the accents certain qualities of his own voice; softened and sweetened, but his own. What was she doing? He stole a glance round. 

Before her lay a piece of zinc, cut to the shape of a scroll three or four feet long, and coated with a dead-surface paint on one side.Hereon she was designing or illuminating, in characters of Church text, the single word 

A L L E L U J A 

"A sweet, saintly, Christian business, hers!" thought he. 

Her presence here was now fairly enough explained, her skill in work of this sort having no doubt been acquired from her father's occupation as an ecclesiastical worker in metal.  The lettering on which she was engaged was clearly intended to be fixed up in some chancel to assist devotion. 

He came out.  It would have been easy to speak to her there and then, but it seemed scarcely honourable towards his aunt to disregard her request so incontinently.  She had used him roughly, but she had brought him up: and the fact of her being powerless to control him lent a pathetic force to a wish that would have been inoperative as an argument. 

So Jude gave no sign.  He would not call upon Sue just yet.  He had other reasons against doing so when he had walked away.  She seemed so dainty beside himself in his rough working-jacket and dusty trousers that he felt he was as yet unready to encounter her, as he had felt about Mr. Phillotson.  And how possible it was that she had inherited the antipathies of her family, and would scorn him, as far as a Christian could, particularly when he had told her that unpleasant part of his history which had resulted in his becoming enchained to one of her own sex whom she would certainly not admire. 

Thus he kept watch over her, and liked to feel she was there. The consciousness of her living presence stimulated him.  But she remained more or less an ideal character, about whose form he began to weave curious and fantastic day-dreams. 

Between two and three weeks afterwards Jude was engaged with some more men, outside Crozier College in Old-time Street, in getting a block of worked freestone from a waggon across the pavement, before hoisting it to the parapet which they were repairing.  Standing in position the head man said, "Spaik when he heave! He-ho!"  And they heaved. 

All of a sudden, as he lifted, his cousin stood close to his elbow, pausing a moment on the bend of her foot till the obstructing object should have been removed.  She looked right into his face with liquid, untranslatable eyes, that combined, or seemed to him to combine, keenness with tenderness, and mystery with both, their expression, as well as that of her lips, taking its life from some words just spoken to a companion, and being carried on into his face quite unconsciously.  She no more observed his presence than that of the dust-motes which his manipulations raised into the sunbeams. 

His closeness to her was so suggestive that he trembled, and turned his face away with a shy instinct to prevent her recognizing him, though as she had never once seen him she could not possibly do so; and might very well never have heard even his name.  He could perceive that though she was a country-girl at bottom, a latter girlhood of some years in London, and a womanhood here, had taken all rawness out of her. 

When she was gone he continued his work, reflecting on her.  He had been so caught by her influence that he had taken no count of her general mould and build.  He remembered now that she was not a large figure, that she was light and slight, of the type dubbed elegant. That was about all he had seen.  There was nothing statuesque in her; all was nervous motion.  She was mobile, living, yet a painter might not have called her handsome or beautiful.  But the much that she was surprised him.  She was quite a long way removed from the rusticity that was his.  How could one of his cross-grained, unfortunate, almost accursed stock, have contrived to reach this pitch of niceness?  London had done it, he supposed. 

From this moment the emotion which had been accumulating in his breast as the bottled-up effect of solitude and the poetized locality he dwelt in, insensibly began to precipitate itself on this half-visionary form; and he perceived that, whatever his obedient wish in a contrary direction, he would soon be unable to resist the desire to make himself known to her. 

He affected to think of her quite in a family way, since there were crushing reasons why he should not and could not think of her in any other. 

The first reason was that he was married, and it would be wrong. The second was that they were cousins.  It was not well for cousins to fall in love even when circumstances seemed to favour the passion. The third: even were he free, in a family like his own where marriage usually meant a tragic sadness, marriage with a blood-relation would duplicate the adverse conditions, and a tragic sadness might be intensified to a tragic horror. 

Therefore, again, he would have to think of Sue with only a relation's mutual interest in one belonging to him; regard her in a practical way as some one to be proud of; to talk and nod to; later on, to be invited to tea by, the emotion spent on her being rigorously that of a kinsman and well-wisher.  So would she be to him a kindly star, an elevating power, a companion in Anglican worship, a tender friend. 

III 

But under the various deterrent influences Jude's instinct was to approach her timidly, and the next Sunday he went to the morning service in the Cathedral church of Cardinal College to gain a further view of her, for he had found that she frequently attended there. 

She did not come, and he awaited her in the afternoon, which was finer.  He knew that if she came at all she would approach the building along the eastern side of the great green quadrangle from which it was accessible, and he stood in a corner while the bell was going.  A few minutes before the hour for service she appeared as one of the figures walking along under the college walls, and at sight of her he advanced up the side opposite, and followed her into the building, more than ever glad that he had not as yet revealed himself.  To see her, and to be himself unseen and unknown, was enough for him at present. 

He lingered awhile in the vestibule, and the service was some way advanced when he was put into a seat.  It was a louring, mournful, still afternoon, when a religion of some sort seems a necessity to ordinary practical men, and not only a luxury of the emotional and leisured classes.  In the dim light and the baffling glare of the clerestory windows he could discern the opposite worshippers indistinctly only, but he saw that Sue was among them.  He had not long discovered the exact seat that she occupied when the chanting of the 119th Psalm in which the choir was engaged reached its second part, _In quo corriget_, the organ changing to a pathetic Gregorian tune as the singers gave forth: 

Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? 

It was the very question that was engaging Jude's attention at this moment.  What a wicked worthless fellow he had been to give vent as he had done to an animal passion for a woman, and allow it to lead to such disastrous consequences; then to think of putting an end to himself; then to go recklessly and get drunk.  The great waves of pedal music tumbled round the choir, and, nursed on the supernatural as he had been, it is not wonderful that he could hardly believe that the psalm was not specially set by some regardful Providence for this moment of his first entry into the solemn building.  And yet it was the ordinary psalm for the twenty-fourth evening of the month. 

The girl for whom he was beginning to nourish an extraordinary tenderness was at this time ensphered by the same harmonies as those which floated into his ears; and the thought was a delight to him. She was probably a frequenter of this place, and, steeped body and soul in church sentiment as she must be by occupation and habit, had, no doubt, much in common with him.  To an impressionable and lonely young man the consciousness of having at last found anchorage for his thoughts, which promised to supply both social and spiritual possibilities, was like the dew of Hermon, and he remained throughout the service in a sustaining atmosphere of ecstasy. 

Though he was loth to suspect it, some people might have said to him that the atmosphere blew as distinctly from Cyprus as from Galilee. 

Jude waited till she had left her seat and passed under the screen before he himself moved.  She did not look towards him, and by the time he reached the door she was half-way down the broad path. Being dressed up in his Sunday suit he was inclined to follow her and reveal himself.  But he was not quite ready; and, alas, ought he to do so with the kind of feeling that was awakening in him? 

For though it had seemed to have an ecclesiastical basis during the service, and he had persuaded himself that such was the case, he could not altogether be blind to the real nature of the magnetism. She was such a stranger that the kinship was affectation, and he said, "It can't be!  I, a man with a wife, must not know her!"  Still Sue WAS his own kin, and the fact of his having a wife, even though she was not in evidence in this hemisphere, might be a help in one sense.  It would put all thought of a tender wish on his part out of Sue's mind, and make her intercourse with him free and fearless. It was with some heartache that he saw how little he cared for the freedom and fearlessness that would result in her from such knowledge. 

Some little time before the date of this service in the cathedral the pretty, liquid-eyed, light-footed young woman, Sue Bridehead, had an afternoon's holiday, and leaving the ecclesiastical establishment in which she not only assisted but lodged, took a walk into the country with a book in her hand.  It was one of those cloudless days which sometimes occur in Wessex and elsewhere between days of cold and wet, as if intercalated by caprice of the weather-god.  She went along for a mile or two until she came to much higher ground than that of the city she had left behind her.  The road passed between green fields, and coming to a stile Sue paused there, to finish the page she was reading, and then looked back at the towers and domes and pinnacles new and old. 

On the other side of the stile, in the footpath, she beheld a foreigner with black hair and a sallow face, sitting on the grass beside a large square board whereon were fixed, as closely as they could stand, a number of plaster statuettes, some of them bronzed, which he was re-arranging before proceeding with them on his way. They were in the main reduced copies of ancient marbles, and comprised divinities of a very different character from those the girl was accustomed to see portrayed, among them being a Venus of standard pattern, a Diana, and, of the other sex, Apollo, Bacchus, and Mars. Though the figures were many yards away from her the south-west sun brought them out so brilliantly against the green herbage that she could discern their contours with luminous distinctness; and being almost in a line between herself and the church towers of the city they awoke in her an oddly foreign and contrasting set of ideas by comparison. The man rose, and, seeing her, politely took off his cap, and cried, "I-i-i-mages!" in an accent that agreed with his appearance. 

In a moment he dexterously lifted upon his knee the great board with its assembled notabilities divine and human, and raised it to the top of his head, bringing them on to her and resting the board on the stile.First he offered her his smaller wares--the busts of kings and queens, then a minstrel, then a winged Cupid. She shook her head. 

"How much are these two?" she said, touching with her finger the Venus and the Apollo--the largest figures on the tray. 

He said she should have them for ten shillings. 

"I cannot afford that," said Sue.  She offered considerably less, and to her surprise the image-man drew them from their wire stay and handed them over the stile.  She clasped them as treasures. 

When they were paid for, and the man had gone, she began to be concerned as to what she should do with them.  They seemed so very large now that they were in her possession, and so very naked. Being of a nervous temperament she trembled at her enterprise. When she handled them the white pipeclay came off on her gloves and jacket.  After carrying them along a little way openly an idea came to her, and, pulling some huge burdock leaves, parsley, and other rank growths from the hedge, she wrapped up her burden as well as she could in these, so that what she carried appeared to be an enormous armful of green stuff gathered by a zealous lover of nature. 

"Well, anything is better than those everlasting church fallals!" she said.  But she was still in a trembling state, and seemed almost to wish she had not bought the figures. 

Occasionally peeping inside the leaves to see that Venus's arm was not broken, she entered with her heathen load into the most Christian city in the country by an obscure street running parallel to the main one, and round a corner to the side door of the establishment to which she was attached.  Her purchases were taken straight up to her own chamber, and she at once attempted to lock them in a box that was her very own property; but finding them too cumbersome she wrapped them in large sheets of brown paper, and stood them on the floor in a corner. 

The mistress of the house, Miss Fontover, was an elderly lady in spectacles, dressed almost like an abbess; a dab at Ritual, as become one of her business, and a worshipper at the ceremonial church of St. Silas, in the suburb of Beersheba before-mentioned, which Jude also had begun to attend.  She was the daughter of a clergyman in reduced circumstances, and at his death, which had occurred several years before this date, she boldly avoided penury by taking over a little shop of church requisites and developing it to its present creditable proportions.  She wore a cross and beads round her neck as her only ornament, and knew the Christian Year by heart. 

She now came to call Sue to tea, and, finding that the girl did not respond for a moment, entered the room just as the other was hastily putting a string round each parcel. 

"Something you have been buying, Miss Bridehead?" she asked, regarding the enwrapped objects. 

"Yes--just something to ornament my room," said Sue. 

"Well, I should have thought I had put enough here already," said Miss Fontover, looking round at the Gothic-framed prints of saints, the Church-text scrolls, and other articles which, having become too stale to sell, had been used to furnish this obscure chamber.  "What is it?  How bulky!"  She tore a little hole, about as big as a wafer, in the brown paper, and tried to peep in.  "Why, statuary?  Two figures?  Where did you get them?" 

"Oh--I bought them of a travelling man who sells casts--" 

"Two saints?" 

"Yes." 

"What ones?" 

"St. Peter and St.--St. Mary Magdalen." 

"Well--now come down to tea, and go and finish that organ-text, if there's light enough afterwards." 

These little obstacles to the indulgence of what had been the merest passing fancy created in Sue a great zest for unpacking her objects and looking at them; and at bedtime, when she was sure of being undisturbed, she unrobed the divinities in comfort.  Placing the pair of figures on the chest of drawers, a candle on each side of them, she withdrew to the bed, flung herself down thereon, and began reading a book she had taken from her box, which Miss Fontover knew nothing of.  It was a volume of Gibbon, and she read the chapter dealing with the reign of Julian the Apostate.  Occasionally she looked up at the statuettes, which appeared strange and out of place, there happening to be a Calvary print hanging between them, and, as if the scene suggested the action, she at length jumped up and withdrew another book from her box--a volume of verse--and turned to the familiar poem-- 

Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean: The world has grown grey from thy breath! 

which she read to the end.  Presently she put out the candles, undressed, and finally extinguished her own light. 

She was of an age which usually sleeps soundly, yet to-night she kept waking up, and every time she opened her eyes there was enough diffused light from the street to show her the white plaster figures, standing on the chest of drawers in odd contrast to their environment of text and martyr, and the Gothic-framed Crucifix-picture that was only discernible now as a Latin cross, the figure thereon being obscured by the shades. 

On one of these occasions the church clocks struck some small hour. It fell upon the ears of another person who sat bending over his books at a not very distant spot in the same city.  Being Saturday night the morrow was one on which Jude had not set his alarm-clock to call him at his usually early time, and hence he had stayed up, as was his custom, two or three hours later than he could afford to do on any other day of the week.  Just then he was earnestly reading from his Griesbach's text.  At the very time that Sue was tossing and staring at her figures, the policeman and belated citizens passing along under his window might have heard, if they had stood still, strange syllables mumbled with fervour within--words that had for Jude an indescribable enchantment: inexplicable sounds something like these:-- 

"_All hemin heis Theos ho Pater, ex hou ta panta, kai hemeis eis auton:_" 

Till the sounds rolled with reverent loudness, as a book was heard to close:-- 

"_Kai heis Kurios Iesous Christos, di hou ta panta kai hemeis di autou!_" 

IV 

He was a handy man at his trade, an all-round man, as artizans in country-towns are apt to be.  In London the man who carves the boss or knob of leafage declines to cut the fragment of moulding which merges in that leafage, as if it were a degradation to do the second half of one whole.  When there was not much Gothic moulding for Jude to run, or much window-tracery on the bankers, he would go out lettering monuments or tombstones, and take a pleasure in the change of handiwork. 

The next time that he saw her was when he was on a ladder executing a job of this sort inside one of the churches.  There was a short morning service, and when the parson entered Jude came down from his ladder, and sat with the half-dozen people forming the congregation, till the prayer should be ended, and he could resume his tapping.  He did not observe till the service was half over that one of the women was Sue, who had perforce accompanied the elderly Miss Fontover thither. 

Jude sat watching her pretty shoulders, her easy, curiously nonchalant risings and sittings, and her perfunctory genuflexions, and thought what a help such an Anglican would have been to him in happier circumstances.  It was not so much his anxiety to get on with his work that made him go up to it immediately the worshipers began to take their leave: it was that he dared not, in this holy spot, confront the woman who was beginning to influence him in such an indescribable manner.  Those three enormous reasons why he must not attempt intimate acquaintance with Sue Bridehead, now that his interest in her had shown itself to be unmistakably of a sexual kind, loomed as stubbornly as ever.  But it was also obvious that man could not live by work alone; that the particular man Jude, at any rate, wanted something to love.  Some men would have rushed incontinently to her, snatched the pleasure of easy friendship which she could hardly refuse, and have left the rest to chance.  Not so Jude--at first. 

But as the days, and still more particularly the lonely evenings, dragged along, he found himself, to his moral consternation, to be thinking more of her instead of thinking less of her, and experiencing a fearful bliss in doing what was erratic, informal, and unexpected.  Surrounded by her influence all day, walking past the spots she frequented, he was always thinking of her, and was obliged to own to himself that his conscience was likely to be the loser in this battle. 

To be sure she was almost an ideality to him still.  Perhaps to know her would be to cure himself of this unexpected and unauthorized passion.  A voice whispered that, though he desired to know her, he did not desire to be cured. 

There was not the least doubt that from his own orthodox point of view the situation was growing immoral. For Sue to be the loved one of a man who was licensed by the laws of his country to love Arabella and none other unto his life's end, was a pretty bad second beginning when the man was bent on such a course as Jude purposed. This conviction was so real with him that one day when, as was frequent, he was at work in a neighbouring village church alone, he felt it to be his duty to pray against his weakness. But much as he wished to be an exemplar in these things he could not get on. It was quite impossible, he found, to ask to be delivered from temptation when your heart's desire was to be tempted unto seventy times seven. So he excused himself. "After all," he said, "it is not altogether an _erotolepsy_ that is the matter with me, as at that first time. I can see that she is exceptionally bright; and it is partly a wish for intellectual sympathy, and a craving for loving-kindness in my solitude." Thus he went on adoring her, fearing to realize that it was human perversity. 

For whatever Sue's virtues, talents, or ecclesiastical saturation, it was certain that those items were not at all the cause of his affection for her.

On an afternoon at this time a young girl entered the stone-mason's yard with some hesitation, and, lifting her skirts to avoid draggling them in the white dust, crossed towards the office. 

"That's a nice girl," said one of the men known as Uncle Joe. 

"Who is she?" asked another. 

"I don't know--I've seen her about here and there.  Why, yes, she's the daughter of that clever chap Bridehead who did all the wrought ironwork at St. Silas' ten years ago, and went away to London afterwards.  I don't know what he's doing now--not much I fancy--as she's come back here." 

Meanwhile the young woman had knocked at the office door and asked if Mr. Jude Fawley was at work in the yard.  It so happened that Jude had gone out somewhere or other that afternoon, which information she received with a look of disappointment, and went away immediately. When Jude returned they told him, and described her, whereupon he exclaimed, "Why--that's my cousin Sue!" 

He looked along the street after her, but she was out of sight.  He had no longer any thought of a conscientious avoidance of her, and resolved to call upon her that very evening.  And when he reached his lodging he found a note from her--a first note--one of those documents which, simple and commonplace in themselves, are seen retrospectively to have been pregnant with impassioned consequences. The very unconsciousness of a looming drama which is shown in such innocent first epistles from women to men, or _vice versa_, makes them, when such a drama follows, and they are read over by the purple or lurid light of it, all the more impressive, solemn, and in cases, terrible. 

Sue's was of the most artless and natural kind.  She addressed him as her dear cousin Jude; said she had only just learnt by the merest accident that he was living in Christminster, and reproached him with not letting her know.  They might have had such nice times together, she said, for she was thrown much upon herself, and had hardly any congenial friend.  But now there was every probability of her soon going away, so that the chance of companionship would be lost perhaps for ever. 

A cold sweat overspread Jude at the news that she was going away. That was a contingency he had never thought of, and it spurred him to write all the more quickly to her.  He would meet her that very evening, he said, one hour from the time of writing, at the cross in the pavement which marked the spot of the Martyrdoms. 

When he had despatched the note by a boy he regretted that in his hurry he should have suggested to her to meet him out of doors, when he might have said he would call upon her.  It was, in fact, the country custom to meet thus, and nothing else had occurred to him. Arabella had been met in the same way, unfortunately, and it might not seem respectable to a dear girl like Sue.  However, it could not be helped now, and he moved towards the point a few minutes before the hour, under the glimmer of the newly lighted lamps. 

The broad street was silent, and almost deserted, although it was not late.  He saw a figure on the other side, which turned out to be hers, and they both converged towards the crossmark at the same moment.  Before either had reached it she called out to him: 

"I am not going to meet you just there, for the first time in my life!  Come further on." 

The voice, though positive and silvery, had been tremulous.  They walked on in parallel lines, and, waiting her pleasure, Jude watched till she showed signs of closing in, when he did likewise, the place being where the carriers' carts stood in the daytime, though there was none on the spot then. 

"I am sorry that I asked you to meet me, and didn't call," began Jude with the bashfulness of a lover.  "But I thought it would save time if we were going to walk." 

"Oh--I don't mind that," she said with the freedom of a friend.  "I have really no place to ask anybody in to.  What I meant was that the place you chose was so horrid--I suppose I ought not to say horrid--I mean gloomy and inauspicious in its associations...  But isn't it funny to begin like this, when I don't know you yet?"  She looked him up and down curiously, though Jude did not look much at her. 

"You seem to know me more than I know you," she added. 

"Yes--I have seen you now and then." 

"And you knew who I was, and didn't speak?  And now I am going away!" 

"Yes.  That's unfortunate.  I have hardly any other friend.  I have, indeed, one very old friend here somewhere, but I don't quite like to call on him just yet.  I wonder if you know anything of him--Mr. Phillotson?  A parson somewhere about the county I think he is." 

"No--I only know of one Mr. Phillotson.  He lives a little way out in the country, at Lumsdon.  He's a village schoolmaster." 

"Ah!  I wonder if he's the same.  Surely it is impossible!  Only a schoolmaster still!  Do you know his Christian name--is it Richard?" 

"Yes--it is; I've directed books to him, though I've never seen him." 

"Then he couldn't do it!" 

Jude's countenance fell, for how could he succeed in an enterprise wherein the great Phillotson had failed?  He would have had a day of despair if the news had not arrived during his sweet Sue's presence, but even at this moment he had visions of how Phillotson's failure in the grand university scheme would depress him when she had gone. 

"As we are going to take a walk, suppose we go and call upon him?" said Jude suddenly.  "It is not late." 

She agreed, and they went along up a hill, and through some prettily wooded country.  Presently the embattled tower and square turret of the church rose into the sky, and then the school-house. They inquired of a person in the street if Mr. Phillotson was likely to be at home, and were informed that he was always at home.  A knock brought him to the school-house door, with a candle in his hand and a look of inquiry on his face, which had grown thin and careworn since Jude last set eyes on him. 

That after all these years the meeting with Mr. Phillotson should be of this homely complexion destroyed at one stroke the halo which had surrounded the school-master's figure in Jude's imagination ever since their parting.  It created in him at the same time a sympathy with Phillotson as an obviously much chastened and disappointed man. Jude told him his name, and said he had come to see him as an old friend who had been kind to him in his youthful days. 

"I don't remember you in the least," said the school-master thoughtfully.  "You were one of my pupils, you say?  Yes, no doubt; but they number so many thousands by this time of my life, and have naturally changed so much, that I remember very few except the quite recent ones." 

"It was out at Marygreen," said Jude, wishing he had not come. 

"Yes.  I was there a short time.  And is this an old pupil, too?" 

"No--that's my cousin...  I wrote to you for some grammars, if you recollect, and you sent them?" 

"Ah--yes!--I do dimly recall that incident." 

"It was very kind of you to do it.  And it was you who first started me on that course.  On the morning you left Marygreen, when your goods were on the waggon, you wished me good-bye, and said your scheme was to be a university man and enter the Church--that a degree was the necessary hall-mark of one who wanted to do anything as a theologian or teacher." 

"I remember I thought all that privately; but I wonder I did not keep my own counsel.  The idea was given up years ago." 

"I have never forgotten it.  It was that which brought me to this part of the country, and out here to see you to-night." 

"Come in," said Phillotson.  "And your cousin, too." 

They entered the parlour of the school-house, where there was a lamp with a paper shade, which threw the light down on three or four books.  Phillotson took it off, so that they could see each other better, and the rays fell on the nervous little face and vivacious dark eyes and hair of Sue, on the earnest features of her cousin, and on the schoolmaster's own maturer face and figure, showing him to be a spare and thoughtful personage of five-and-forty, with a thin-lipped, somewhat refined mouth, a slightly stooping habit, and a black frock coat, which from continued frictions shone a little at the shoulder-blades, the middle of the back, and the elbows. 

The old friendship was imperceptibly renewed, the schoolmaster speaking of his experiences, and the cousins of theirs.  He told them that he still thought of the Church sometimes, and that though he could not enter it as he had intended to do in former years he might enter it as a licentiate.  Meanwhile, he said, he was comfortable in his present position, though he was in want of a pupil-teacher. 

They did not stay to supper, Sue having to be indoors before it grew late, and the road was retraced to Christminster.  Though they had talked of nothing more than general subjects, Jude was surprised to find what a revelation of woman his cousin was to him.  She was so vibrant that everything she did seemed to have its source in feeling. An exciting thought would make her walk ahead so fast that he could hardly keep up with her; and her sensitiveness on some points was such that it might have been misread as vanity.  It was with heart-sickness he perceived that, while her sentiments towards him were those of the frankest friendliness only, he loved her more than before becoming acquainted with her; and the gloom of the walk home lay not in the night overhead, but in the thought of her departure. 

"Why must you leave Christminster?" he said regretfully.  "How can you do otherwise than cling to a city in whose history such men as Newman, Pusey, Ward, Keble, loom so large!" 

"Yes--they do.  Though how large do they loom in the history of the world? ...  What a funny reason for caring to stay!  I should never have thought of it!"  She laughed. 

"Well--I must go," she continued.  "Miss Fontover, one of the partners whom I serve, is offended with me, and I with her; and it is best to go." 

"How did that happen?" 

"She broke some statuary of mine." 

"Oh?  Wilfully?" 

"Yes.  She found it in my room, and though it was my property she threw it on the floor and stamped on it, because it was not according to her taste, and ground the arms and the head of one of the figures all to bits with her heel--a horrid thing!" 

"Too Catholic-Apostolic for her, I suppose?  No doubt she called them popish images and talked of the invocation of saints." 

"No...  No, she didn't do that.  She saw the matter quite differently." 

"Ah!  Then I am surprised!" 

"Yes.  It was for quite some other reason that she didn't like my patron-saints.  So I was led to retort upon her; and the end of it was that I resolved not to stay, but to get into an occupation in which I shall be more independent." 

"Why don't you try teaching again?  You once did, I heard." 

"I never thought of resuming it; for I was getting on as an art-designer." 

"DO let me ask Mr. Phillotson to let you try your hand in his school?  If you like it, and go to a training college, and become a first-class certificated mistress, you get twice as large an income as any designer or church artist, and twice as much freedom." 

"Well--ask him.  Now I must go in.  Good-bye, dear Jude!  I am so glad we have met at last.  We needn't quarrel because our parents did, need we?" 

Jude did not like to let her see quite how much he agreed with her, and went his way to the remote street in which he had his lodging. 

To keep Sue Bridehead near him was now a desire which operated without regard of consequences, and the next evening he again set out for Lumsdon, fearing to trust to the persuasive effects of a note only.  The school-master was unprepared for such a proposal. 

"What I rather wanted was a second year's transfer, as it is called," he said.  "Of course your cousin would do, personally; but she has had no experience.  Oh--she has, has she?  Does she really think of adopting teaching as a profession?" 

Jude said she was disposed to do so, he thought, and his ingenious arguments on her natural fitness for assisting Mr. Phillotson, of which Jude knew nothing whatever, so influenced the schoolmaster that he said he would engage her, assuring Jude as a friend that unless his cousin really meant to follow on in the same course, and regarded this step as the first stage of an apprenticeship, of which her training in a normal school would be the second stage, her time would be wasted quite, the salary being merely nominal. 

The day after this visit Phillotson received a letter from Jude, containing the information that he had again consulted his cousin, who took more and more warmly to the idea of tuition; and that she had agreed to come.  It did not occur for a moment to the schoolmaster and recluse that Jude's ardour in promoting the arrangement arose from any other feelings towards Sue than the instinct of co-operation common among members of the same family. 

V 

The schoolmaster sat in his homely dwelling attached to the school, both being modern erections; and he looked across the way at the old house in which his teacher Sue had a lodging.  The arrangement had been concluded very quickly.  A pupil-teacher who was to have been transferred to Mr. Phillotson's school had failed him, and Sue had been taken as stop-gap.  All such provisional arrangements as these could only last till the next annual visit of H.M. Inspector, whose approval was necessary to make them permanent.  Having taught for some two years in London, though she had abandoned that vocation of late, Miss Bridehead was not exactly a novice, and Phillotson thought there would be no difficulty in retaining her services, which he already wished to do, though she had only been with him three or four weeks.  He had found her quite as bright as Jude had described her; and what master-tradesman does not wish to keep an apprentice who saves him half his labour? 

It was a little over half-past eight o'clock in the morning and he was waiting to see her cross the road to the school, when he would follow.  At twenty minutes to nine she did cross, a light hat tossed on her head; and he watched her as a curiosity.  A new emanation, which had nothing to do with her skill as a teacher, seemed to surround her this morning.  He went to the school also, and Sue remained governing her class at the other end of the room, all day under his eye.  She certainly was an excellent teacher. 

It was part of his duty to give her private lessons in the evening, and some article in the Code made it necessary that a respectable, elderly woman should be present at these lessons when the teacher and the taught were of different sexes.  Richard Phillotson thought of the absurdity of the regulation in this case, when he was old enough to be the girl's father; but he faithfully acted up to it; and sat down with her in a room where Mrs. Hawes, the widow at whose house Sue lodged, occupied herself with sewing.  The regulation was, indeed, not easy to evade, for there was no other sitting-room in the dwelling. 

Sometimes as she figured--it was arithmetic that they were working at--she would involuntarily glance up with a little inquiring smile at him, as if she assumed that, being the master, he must perceive all that was passing in her brain, as right or wrong.  Phillotson was not really thinking of the arithmetic at all, but of her, in a novel way which somehow seemed strange to him as preceptor.  Perhaps she knew that he was thinking of her thus. 

For a few weeks their work had gone on with a monotony which in itself was a delight to him.  Then it happened that the children were to be taken to Christminster to see an itinerant exhibition, in the shape of a model of Jerusalem, to which schools were admitted at a penny a head in the interests of education.  They marched along the road two and two, she beside her class with her simple cotton sunshade, her little thumb cocked up against its stem; and Phillotson behind in his long dangling coat, handling his walking-stick genteelly, in the musing mood which had come over him since her arrival.  The afternoon was one of sun and dust, and when they entered the exhibition room few people were present but themselves. The model of the ancient city stood in the middle of the apartment, and the proprietor, with a fine religious philanthropy written on his features, walked round it with a pointer in his hand, showing the young people the various quarters and places known to them by name from reading their Bibles; Mount Moriah, the Valley of Jehoshaphat, the City of Zion, the walls and the gates, outside one of which there was a large mound like a tumulus, and on the mound a little white cross.  The spot, he said, was Calvary. 

"I think," said Sue to the schoolmaster, as she stood with him a little in the background, "that this model, elaborate as it is, is a very imaginary production.  How does anybody know that Jerusalem was like this in the time of Christ?  I am sure this man doesn't." 

"It is made after the best conjectural maps, based on actual visits to the city as it now exists." 

"I fancy we have had enough of Jerusalem," she said, "considering we are not descended from the Jews.  There was nothing first-rate about the place, or people, after all--as there was about Athens, Rome, Alexandria, and other old cities." 

"But my dear girl, consider what it is to us!" 

She was silent, for she was easily repressed; and then perceived behind the group of children clustered round the model a young man in a white flannel jacket, his form being bent so low in his intent inspection of the Valley of Jehoshaphat that his face was almost hidden from view by the Mount of Olives.  "Look at your cousin Jude," continued the schoolmaster.  "He doesn't think we have had enough of Jerusalem!" 

"Ah--I didn't see him!" she cried in her quick, light voice. "Jude--how seriously you are going into it!" 

Jude started up from his reverie, and saw her.  "Oh--Sue!" he said, with a glad flush of embarrassment.  "These are your school-children, of course!  I saw that schools were admitted in the afternoons, and thought you might come; but I got so deeply interested that I didn't remember where I was.  How it carries one back, doesn't it!  I could examine it for hours, but I have only a few minutes, unfortunately; for I am in the middle of a job out here." 

"Your cousin is so terribly clever that she criticizes it unmercifully," said Phillotson, with good-humoured satire.  "She is quite sceptical as to its correctness." 

"No, Mr. Phillotson, I am not--altogether!  I hate to be what is called a clever girl--there are too many of that sort now!" answered Sue sensitively.  "I only meant--I don't know what I meant--except that it was what you don't understand!" 

"_I_ know your meaning," said Jude ardently (although he did not). "And I think you are quite right." 

"That's a good Jude--I know YOU believe in me!"  She impulsively seized his hand, and leaving a reproachful look on the schoolmaster turned away to Jude, her voice revealing a tremor which she herself felt to be absurdly uncalled for by sarcasm so gentle.  She had not the least conception how the hearts of the twain went out to her at this momentary revelation of feeling, and what a complication she was building up thereby in the futures of both. 

The model wore too much of an educational aspect for the children not to tire of it soon, and a little later in the afternoon they were all marched back to Lumsdon, Jude returning to his work.  He watched the juvenile flock in their clean frocks and pinafores, filing down the street towards the country beside Phillotson and Sue, and a sad, dissatisfied sense of being out of the scheme of the latters' lives had possession of him.  Phillotson had invited him to walk out and see them on Friday evening, when there would be no lessons to give to Sue, and Jude had eagerly promised to avail himself of the opportunity. 

Meanwhile the scholars and teachers moved homewards, and the next day, on looking on the blackboard in Sue's class, Phillotson was surprised to find upon it, skilfully drawn in chalk, a perspective view of Jerusalem, with every building shown in its place. 

"I thought you took no interest in the model, and hardly looked at it?" he said. 

"I hardly did," said she, "but I remembered that much of it." 

"It is more than I had remembered myself." 

Her Majesty's school-inspector was at that time paying "surprise-visits" in this neighbourhood to test the teaching unawares; and two days later, in the middle of the morning lessons, the latch of the door was softly lifted, and in walked my gentleman, the king of terrors--to pupil-teachers. 

To Mr. Phillotson the surprise was not great; like the lady in the story, he had been played that trick too many times to be unprepared. But Sue's class was at the further end of the room, and her back was towards the entrance; the inspector therefore came and stood behind her and watched her teaching some half-minute before she became aware of his presence.  She turned, and realized that an oft-dreaded moment had come.  The effect upon her timidity was such that she uttered a cry of fright.  Phillotson, with a strange instinct of solicitude quite beyond his control, was at her side just in time to prevent her falling from faintness.  She soon recovered herself, and laughed; but when the inspector had gone there was a reaction, and she was so white that Phillotson took her into his room, and gave her some brandy to bring her round.  She found him holding her hand. 

"You ought to have told me," she gasped petulantly, "that one of the inspector's surprise-visits was imminent!  Oh, what shall I do!  Now he'll write and tell the managers that I am no good, and I shall be disgraced for ever!" 

"He won't do that, my dear little girl.  You are the best teacher ever I had!" 

He looked so gently at her that she was moved, and regretted that she had upbraided him.  When she was better she went home. 

Jude in the meantime had been waiting impatiently for Friday.  On both Wednesday and Thursday he had been so much under the influence of his desire to see her that he walked after dark some distance along the road in the direction of the village, and, on returning to his room to read, found himself quite unable to concentrate his mind on the page.  On Friday, as soon as he had got himself up as he thought Sue would like to see him, and made a hasty tea, he set out, notwithstanding that the evening was wet.  The trees overhead deepened the gloom of the hour, and they dripped sadly upon him, impressing him with forebodings--illogical forebodings; for though he knew that he loved her he also knew that he could not be more to her than he was. 

On turning the corner and entering the village the first sight that greeted his eyes was that of two figures under one umbrella coming out of the vicarage gate.  He was too far back for them to notice him, but he knew in a moment that they were Sue and Phillotson.  The latter was holding the umbrella over her head, and they had evidently been paying a visit to the vicar--probably on some business connected with the school work.  And as they walked along the wet and deserted lane Jude saw Phillotson place his arm round the girl's waist; whereupon she gently removed it; but he replaced it; and she let it remain, looking quickly round her with an air of misgiving.  She did not look absolutely behind her, and therefore did not see Jude, who sank into the hedge like one struck with a blight.  There he remained hidden till they had reached Sue's cottage and she had passed in, Phillotson going on to the school hard by. 

"Oh, he's too old for her--too old!" cried Jude in all the terrible sickness of hopeless, handicapped love. 

He could not interfere.  Was he not Arabella's?  He was unable to go on further, and retraced his steps towards Christminster.  Every tread of his feet seemed to say to him that he must on no account stand in the schoolmaster's way with Sue.  Phillotson was perhaps twenty years her senior, but many a happy marriage had been made in such conditions of age.  The ironical clinch to his sorrow was given by the thought that the intimacy between his cousin and the schoolmaster had been brought about entirely by himself. 

VI 

Jude's old and embittered aunt lay unwell at Marygreen, and on the following Sunday he went to see her--a visit which was the result of a victorious struggle against his inclination to turn aside to the village of Lumsdon and obtain a miserable interview with his cousin, in which the word nearest his heart could not be spoken, and the sight which had tortured him could not be revealed. 

His aunt was now unable to leave her bed, and a great part of Jude's short day was occupied in making arrangements for her comfort.  The little bakery business had been sold to a neighbour, and with the proceeds of this and her savings she was comfortably supplied with necessaries and more, a widow of the same village living with her and ministering to her wants.  It was not till the time had nearly come for him to leave that he obtained a quiet talk with her, and his words tended insensibly towards his cousin. 

"Was Sue born here?" 

"She was--in this room.  They were living here at that time.  What made 'ee ask that?" 

"Oh--I wanted to know." 

"Now you've been seeing her!" said the harsh old woman.  "And what did I tell 'ee?" 

"Well--that I was not to see her." 

"Have you gossiped with her?" 

"Yes." 

"Then don't keep it up.  She was brought up by her father to hate her mother's family; and she'll look with no favour upon a working chap like you--a townish girl as she's become by now.  I never cared much about her.  A pert little thing, that's what she was too often, with her tight-strained nerves.  Many's the time I've smacked her for her impertinence.  Why, one day when she was walking into the pond with her shoes and stockings off, and her petticoats pulled above her knees, afore I could cry out for shame, she said: 'Move on, Aunty! This is no sight for modest eyes!'" 

"She was a little child then." 

"She was twelve if a day." 

"Well--of course.  But now she's older she's of a thoughtful, quivering, tender nature, and as sensitive as--" 

"Jude!" cried his aunt, springing up in bed.  "Don't you be a fool about her!" 

"No, no, of course not." 

"Your marrying that woman Arabella was about as bad a thing as a man could possibly do for himself by trying hard.  But she's gone to the other side of the world, and med never trouble you again.  And there'll be a worse thing if you, tied and bound as you be, should have a fancy for Sue.  If your cousin is civil to you, take her civility for what it is worth.  But anything more than a relation's good wishes it is stark madness for 'ee to give her.  If she's townish and wanton it med bring 'ee to ruin." 

"Don't say anything against her, Aunt!  Don't, please!" 

A relief was afforded to him by the entry of the companion and nurse of his aunt, who must have been listening to the conversation, for she began a commentary on past years, introducing Sue Bridehead as a character in her recollections.  She described what an odd little maid Sue had been when a pupil at the village school across the green opposite, before her father went to London--how, when the vicar arranged readings and recitations, she appeared on the platform, the smallest of them all, "in her little white frock, and shoes, and pink sash"; how she recited "Excelsior," "There was a sound of revelry by night," and "The Raven"; how during the delivery she would knit her little brows and glare round tragically, and say to the empty air, as if some real creature stood there-- 

"Ghastly, grim, and ancient Raven, wandering from the Nightly shore, Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!" 

"She'd bring up the nasty carrion bird that clear," corroborated the sick woman reluctantly, "as she stood there in her little sash and things, that you could see un a'most before your very eyes.  You too, Jude, had the same trick as a child of seeming to see things in the air." 

The neighbour told also of Sue's accomplishments in other kinds: 

"She was not exactly a tomboy, you know; but she could do things that only boys do, as a rule.  I've seen her hit in and steer down the long slide on yonder pond, with her little curls blowing, one of a file of twenty moving along against the sky like shapes painted on glass, and up the back slide without stopping.  All boys except herself; and then they'd cheer her, and then she'd say, 'Don't be saucy, boys,' and suddenly run indoors.  They'd try to coax her out again.  But 'a wouldn't come." 

These retrospective visions of Sue only made Jude the more miserable that he was unable to woo her, and he left the cottage of his aunt that day with a heavy heart.  He would fain have glanced into the school to see the room in which Sue's little figure had so glorified itself; but he checked his desire and went on. 

It being Sunday evening some villagers who had known him during his residence here were standing in a group in their best clothes.  Jude was startled by a salute from one of them: 

"Ye've got there right enough, then!" 

Jude showed that he did not understand. 

"Why, to the seat of l'arning--the 'City of Light' you used to talk to us about as a little boy!  Is it all you expected of it?" 

"Yes; more!" cried Jude. 

"When I was there once for an hour I didn't see much in it for my part; auld crumbling buildings, half church, half almshouse, and not much going on at that." 

"You are wrong, John; there is more going on than meets the eye of a man walking through the streets.  It is a unique centre of thought and religion--the intellectual and spiritual granary of this country. All that silence and absence of goings-on is the stillness of infinite motion--the sleep of the spinning-top, to borrow the simile of a well-known writer." 

"Oh, well, it med be all that, or it med not.  As I say, I didn't see nothing of it the hour or two I was there; so I went in and had a pot o' beer, and a penny loaf, and a ha'porth o' cheese, and waited till it was time to come along home.  You've j'ined a college by this time, I suppose?" 

"Ah, no!" said Jude.  "I am almost as far off that as ever." 

"How so?" 

Jude slapped his pocket. 

"Just what we thought!  Such places be not for such as you--only for them with plenty o' money." 

"There you are wrong," said Jude, with some bitterness.  "They are for such ones!" 

Still, the remark was sufficient to withdraw Jude's attention from the imaginative world he had lately inhabited, in which an abstract figure, more or less himself, was steeping his mind in a sublimation of the arts and sciences, and making his calling and election sure to a seat in the paradise of the learned.  He was set regarding his prospects in a cold northern light.  He had lately felt that he could not quite satisfy himself in his Greek--in the Greek of the dramatists particularly.  So fatigued was he sometimes after his day's work that he could not maintain the critical attention necessary for thorough application.  He felt that he wanted a coach--a friend at his elbow to tell him in a moment what sometimes would occupy him a weary month in extracting from unanticipative, clumsy books. 

It was decidedly necessary to consider facts a little more closely than he had done of late.  What was the good, after all, of using up his spare hours in a vague labour called "private study" without giving an outlook on practicabilities? 

"I ought to have thought of this before," he said, as he journeyed back.  "It would have been better never to have embarked in the scheme at all than to do it without seeing clearly where I am going, or what I am aiming at...  This hovering outside the walls of the colleges, as if expecting some arm to be stretched out from them to lift me inside, won't do!  I must get special information." 

The next week accordingly he sought it.  What at first seemed an opportunity occurred one afternoon when he saw an elderly gentleman, who had been pointed out as the head of a particular college, walking in the public path of a parklike enclosure near the spot at which Jude chanced to be sitting.  The gentleman came nearer, and Jude looked anxiously at his face.  It seemed benign, considerate, yet rather reserved.  On second thoughts Jude felt that he could not go up and address him; but he was sufficiently influenced by the incident to think what a wise thing it would be for him to state his difficulties by letter to some of the best and most judicious of these old masters, and obtain their advice. 

During the next week or two he accordingly placed himself in such positions about the city as would afford him glimpses of several of the most distinguished among the provosts, wardens, and other heads of houses; and from those he ultimately selected five whose physiognomies seemed to say to him that they were appreciative and far-seeing men.  To these five he addressed letters, briefly stating his difficulties, and asking their opinion on his stranded situation. 

When the letters were posted Jude mentally began to criticize them; he wished they had not been sent.  "It is just one of those intrusive, vulgar, pushing, applications which are so common in these days," he thought.  "Why couldn't I know better than address utter strangers in such a way?  I may be an impostor, an idle scamp, a man with a bad character, for all that they know to the contrary... Perhaps that's what I am!" 

Nevertheless, he found himself clinging to the hope of some reply as to his one last chance of redemption.  He waited day after day, saying that it was perfectly absurd to expect, yet expecting. While he waited he was suddenly stirred by news about Phillotson. Phillotson was giving up the school near Christminster, for a larger one further south, in Mid-Wessex.  What this meant; how it would affect his cousin; whether, as seemed possible, it was a practical move of the schoolmaster's towards a larger income, in view of a provision for two instead of one, he would not allow himself to say. And the tender relations between Phillotson and the young girl of whom Jude was passionately enamoured effectually made it repugnant to Jude's tastes to apply to Phillotson for advice on his own scheme. 

Meanwhile the academic dignitaries to whom Jude had written vouchsafed no answer, and the young man was thus thrown back entirely on himself, as formerly, with the added gloom of a weakened hope.  By indirect inquiries he soon perceived clearly what he had long uneasily suspected, that to qualify himself for certain open scholarships and exhibitions was the only brilliant course.  But to do this a good deal of coaching would be necessary, and much natural ability.  It was next to impossible that a man reading on his own system, however widely and thoroughly, even over the prolonged period of ten years, should be able to compete with those who had passed their lives under trained teachers and had worked to ordained lines. 

The other course, that of buying himself in, so to speak, seemed the only one really open to men like him, the difficulty being simply of a material kind.  With the help of his information he began to reckon the extent of this material obstacle, and ascertained, to his dismay, that, at the rate at which, with the best of fortune, he would be able to save money, fifteen years must elapse before he could be in a position to forward testimonials to the head of a college and advance to a matriculation examination.  The undertaking was hopeless. 

He saw what a curious and cunning glamour the neighbourhood of the place had exercised over him.  To get there and live there, to move among the churches and halls and become imbued with the _genius loci_, had seemed to his dreaming youth, as the spot shaped its charms to him from its halo on the horizon, the obvious and ideal thing to do.  "Let me only get there," he had said with the fatuousness of Crusoe over his big boat, "and the rest is but a matter of time and energy."  It would have been far better for him in every way if he had never come within sight and sound of the delusive precincts, had gone to some busy commercial town with the sole object of making money by his wits, and thence surveyed his plan in true perspective.  Well, all that was clear to him amounted to this, that the whole scheme had burst up, like an iridescent soap-bubble, under the touch of a reasoned inquiry.  He looked back at himself along the vista of his past years, and his thought was akin to Heine's: 

Above the youth's inspired and flashing eyes I see the motley mocking fool's-cap rise! 

Fortunately he had not been allowed to bring his disappointment into his dear Sue's life by involving her in this collapse.  And the painful details of his awakening to a sense of his limitations should now be spared her as far as possible.  After all, she had only known a little part of the miserable struggle in which he had been engaged thus unequipped, poor, and unforeseeing. 

He always remembered the appearance of the afternoon on which he awoke from his dream.  Not quite knowing what to do with himself, he went up to an octagonal chamber in the lantern of a singularly built theatre that was set amidst this quaint and singular city.  It had windows all round, from which an outlook over the whole town and its edifices could be gained.  Jude's eyes swept all the views in succession, meditatively, mournfully, yet sturdily.  Those buildings and their associations and privileges were not for him.  From the looming roof of the great library, into which he hardly ever had time to enter, his gaze travelled on to the varied spires, halls, gables, streets, chapels, gardens, quadrangles, which composed the ensemble of this unrivalled panorama.  He saw that his destiny lay not with these, but among the manual toilers in the shabby purlieu which he himself occupied, unrecognized as part of the city at all by its visitors and panegyrists, yet without whose denizens the hard readers could not read nor the high thinkers live. 

He looked over the town into the country beyond, to the trees which screened her whose presence had at first been the support of his heart, and whose loss was now a maddening torture.  But for this blow he might have borne with his fate.  With Sue as companion he could have renounced his ambitions with a smile.  Without her it was inevitable that the reaction from the long strain to which he had subjected himself should affect him disastrously.  Phillotson had no doubt passed through a similar intellectual disappointment to that which now enveloped him.  But the schoolmaster had been since blest with the consolation of sweet Sue, while for him there was no consoler. 

Descending to the streets, he went listlessly along till he arrived at an inn, and entered it.  Here he drank several glasses of beer in rapid succession, and when he came out it was night.  By the light of the flickering lamps he rambled home to supper, and had not long been sitting at table when his landlady brought up a letter that had just arrived for him.  She laid it down as if impressed with a sense of its possible importance, and on looking at it Jude perceived that it bore the embossed stamp of one of the colleges whose heads he had addressed.  "ONE--at last!" cried Jude. 

The communication was brief, and not exactly what he had expected; though it really was from the master in person.  It ran thus: 

BIBLIOLL COLLEGE. 

SIR,--I have read your letter with interest; and, judging from your description of yourself as a working-man, I venture to think that you will have a much better chance of success in life by remaining in your own sphere and sticking to your trade than by adopting any other course. That, therefore, is what I advise you to do.  Yours faithfully, 

T. TETUPHENAY. 

To Mr. J. FAWLEY, Stone-mason. 

This terribly sensible advice exasperated Jude.  He had known all that before.  He knew it was true.  Yet it seemed a hard slap after ten years of labour, and its effect upon him just now was to make him rise recklessly from the table, and, instead of reading as usual, to go downstairs and into the street.  He stood at a bar and tossed off two or three glasses, then unconsciously sauntered along till he came to a spot called The Fourways in the middle of the city, gazing abstractedly at the groups of people like one in a trance, till, coming to himself, he began talking to the policeman fixed there. 

That officer yawned, stretched out his elbows, elevated himself an inch and a half on the balls of his toes, smiled, and looking humorously at Jude, said, "You've had a wet, young man." 

"No; I've only begun," he replied cynically. 

Whatever his wetness, his brains were dry enough.  He only heard in part the policeman's further remarks, having fallen into thought on what struggling people like himself had stood at that crossway, whom nobody ever thought of now.  It had more history than the oldest college in the city.  It was literally teeming, stratified, with the shades of human groups, who had met there for tragedy, comedy, farce; real enactments of the intensest kind.  At Fourways men had stood and talked of Napoleon, the loss of America, the execution of King Charles, the burning of the Martyrs, the Crusades, the Norman Conquest, possibly of the arrival of Caesar.  Here the two sexes had met for loving, hating, coupling, parting; had waited, had suffered, for each other; had triumphed over each other; cursed each other in jealousy, blessed each other in forgiveness. 

He began to see that the town life was a book of humanity infinitely more palpitating, varied, and compendious than the gown life. These struggling men and women before him were the reality of Christminster, though they knew little of Christ or Minster. That was one of the humours of things.  The floating population of students and teachers, who did know both in a way, were not Christminster in a local sense at all. 

He looked at his watch, and, in pursuit of this idea, he went on till he came to a public hall, where a promenade concert was in progress. Jude entered, and found the room full of shop youths and girls, soldiers, apprentices, boys of eleven smoking cigarettes, and light women of the more respectable and amateur class.  He had tapped the real Christminster life.  A band was playing, and the crowd walked about and jostled each other, and every now and then a man got upon a platform and sang a comic song. 

The spirit of Sue seemed to hover round him and prevent his flirting and drinking with the frolicsome girls who made advances--wistful to gain a little joy.  At ten o'clock he came away, choosing a circuitous route homeward to pass the gates of the college whose head had just sent him the note. 

The gates were shut, and, by an impulse, he took from his pocket the lump of chalk which as a workman he usually carried there, and wrote along the wall: 

"_I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?_"--Job xii. 3. 

VII 

The stroke of scorn relieved his mind, and the next morning he laughed at his self-conceit. But the laugh was not a healthy one. He re-read the letter from the master, and the wisdom in its lines, which had at first exasperated him, chilled and depressed him now. He saw himself as a fool indeed. 

Deprived of the objects of both intellect and emotion, he could not proceed to his work.  Whenever he felt reconciled to his fate as a student, there came to disturb his calm his hopeless relations with Sue.  That the one affined soul he had ever met was lost to him through his marriage returned upon him with cruel persistency, till, unable to bear it longer, he again rushed for distraction to the real Christminster life.  He now sought it out in an obscure and low-ceiled tavern up a court which was well known to certain worthies of the place, and in brighter times would have interested him simply by its quaintness.  Here he sat more or less all the day, convinced that he was at bottom a vicious character, of whom it was hopeless to expect anything. 

In the evening the frequenters of the house dropped in one by one, Jude still retaining his seat in the corner, though his money was all spent, and he had not eaten anything the whole day except a biscuit. He surveyed his gathering companions with all the equanimity and philosophy of a man who has been drinking long and slowly, and made friends with several: to wit, Tinker Taylor, a decayed church-ironmonger who appeared to have been of a religious turn in earlier years, but was somewhat blasphemous now; also a red-nosed auctioneer; also two Gothic masons like himself, called Uncle Jim and Uncle Joe.  There were present, too, some clerks, and a gown- and surplice-maker's assistant; two ladies who sported moral characters of various depths of shade, according to their company, nicknamed "Bower o' Bliss" and "Freckles"; some horsey men "in the know" of betting circles; a travelling actor from the theatre, and two devil-may-care young men who proved to be gownless undergraduates; they had slipped in by stealth to meet a man about bull-pups, and stayed to drink and smoke short pipes with the racing gents aforesaid, looking at their watches every now and then. 

The conversation waxed general.  Christminster society was criticized, the dons, magistrates, and other people in authority being sincerely pitied for their shortcomings, while opinions on how they ought to conduct themselves and their affairs to be properly respected, were exchanged in a large-minded and disinterested manner. 

Jude Fawley, with the self-conceit, effrontery, and _aplomb_ of a strong-brained fellow in liquor, threw in his remarks somewhat peremptorily; and his aims having been what they were for so many years, everything the others said turned upon his tongue, by a sort of mechanical craze, to the subject of scholarship and study, the extent of his own learning being dwelt upon with an insistence that would have appeared pitiable to himself in his sane hours. 

"I don't care a damn," he was saying, "for any provost, warden, principal, fellow, or cursed master of arts in the university!  What I know is that I'd lick 'em on their own ground if they'd give me a chance, and show 'em a few things they are not up to yet!" 

"Hear, hear!" said the undergraduates from the corner, where they were talking privately about the pups. 

"You always was fond o' books, I've heard," said Tinker Taylor, "and I don't doubt what you state.  Now with me 'twas different.  I always saw there was more to be learnt outside a book than in; and I took my steps accordingly, or I shouldn't have been the man I am." 

"You aim at the Church, I believe?" said Uncle Joe.  "If you are such a scholar as to pitch yer hopes so high as that, why not give us a specimen of your scholarship?  Canst say the Creed in Latin, man? That was how they once put it to a chap down in my country." 

"I should think so!" said Jude haughtily. 

"Not he!  Like his conceit!" screamed one of the ladies. 

"Just you shut up, Bower o' Bliss!" said one of the undergraduates. "Silence!"  He drank off the spirits in his tumbler, rapped with it on the counter, and announced, "The gentleman in the corner is going to rehearse the Articles of his Belief, in the Latin tongue, for the edification of the company." 

"I won't!" said Jude. 

"Yes--have a try!" said the surplice-maker. 

"You can't!" said Uncle Joe. 

"Yes, he can!" said Tinker Taylor. 

"I'll swear I can!" said Jude.  "Well, come now, stand me a small Scotch cold, and I'll do it straight off." 

"That's a fair offer," said the undergraduate, throwing down the money for the whisky. 

The barmaid concocted the mixture with the bearing of a person compelled to live amongst animals of an inferior species, and the glass was handed across to Jude, who, having drunk the contents, stood up and began rhetorically, without hesitation: 

"_Credo in unum Deum, Patrem omnipotentem, Factorem coeli et terrae, visibilium omnium et invisibilium._" 

"Good!  Excellent Latin!" cried one of the undergraduates, who, however, had not the slightest conception of a single word. 

A silence reigned among the rest in the bar, and the maid stood still, Jude's voice echoing sonorously into the inner parlour, where the landlord was dozing, and bringing him out to see what was going on.  Jude had declaimed steadily ahead, and was continuing: 

"_Crucifixus etiam pro nobis: sub Pontio Pilato passus, et sepultus est.  Et resurrexit tertia die, secundum Scripturas._" 

"That's the Nicene," sneered the second undergraduate.  "And we wanted the Apostles'!" 

"You didn't say so!  And every fool knows, except you, that the Nicene is the most historic creed!" 

"Let un go on, let un go on!" said the auctioneer. 

But Jude's mind seemed to grow confused soon, and he could not get on.  He put his hand to his forehead, and his face assumed an expression of pain. 

"Give him another glass--then he'll fetch up and get through it," said Tinker Taylor. 

Somebody threw down threepence, the glass was handed, Jude stretched out his arm for it without looking, and having swallowed the liquor, went on in a moment in a revived voice, raising it as he neared the end with the manner of a priest leading a congregation: 

"_Et in Spiritum Sanctum, Dominum et vivificantem, qui ex Patre Filioque procedit.  Qui cum Patre et Filio simul adoratur et conglorificatur.  Qui locutus est per prophetas. 

"Et unam Catholicam et Apostolicam Ecclesiam.  Confiteor unum Baptisma in remissionem peccatorum.  Et exspecto Resurrectionem mortuorum.  Et vitam venturi saeculi.  Amen._" 

"Well done!" said several, enjoying the last word, as being the first and only one they had recognized. 

Then Jude seemed to shake the fumes from his brain, as he stared round upon them. 

"You pack of fools!" he cried.  "Which one of you knows whether I have said it or no?  It might have been the Ratcatcher's Daughter in double Dutch for all that your besotted heads can tell!  See what I have brought myself to--the crew I have come among!" 

The landlord, who had already had his license endorsed for harbouring queer characters, feared a riot, and came outside the counter; but Jude, in his sudden flash of reason, had turned in disgust and left the scene, the door slamming with a dull thud behind him. 

He hastened down the lane and round into the straight broad street, which he followed till it merged in the highway, and all sound of his late companions had been left behind.  Onward he still went, under the influence of a childlike yearning for the one being in the world to whom it seemed possible to fly--an unreasoning desire, whose ill judgement was not apparent to him now.  In the course of an hour, when it was between ten and eleven o'clock, he entered the village of Lumsdon, and reaching the cottage, saw that a light was burning in a downstairs room, which he assumed, rightly as it happened, to be hers. 

Jude stepped close to the wall, and tapped with his finger on the pane, saying impatiently, "Sue, Sue!" 

She must have recognized his voice, for the light disappeared from the apartment, and in a second or two the door was unlocked and opened, and Sue appeared with a candle in her hand. 

"Is it Jude?  Yes, it is!  My dear, dear cousin, what's the matter?" 

"Oh, I am--I couldn't help coming, Sue!" said he, sinking down upon the doorstep.  "I am so wicked, Sue--my heart is nearly broken, and I could not bear my life as it was!  So I have been drinking, and blaspheming, or next door to it, and saying holy things in disreputable quarters--repeating in idle bravado words which ought never to be uttered but reverently!  Oh, do anything with me, Sue--kill me--I don't care!  Only don't hate me and despise me like all the rest of the world!" 

"You are ill, poor dear!  No, I won't despise you; of course I won't! Come in and rest, and let me see what I can do for you.  Now lean on me, and don't mind."  With one hand holding the candle and the other supporting him, she led him indoors, and placed him in the only easy chair the meagrely furnished house afforded, stretching his feet upon another, and pulling off his boots.  Jude, now getting towards his sober senses, could only say, "Dear, dear Sue!" in a voice broken by grief and contrition. 

She asked him if he wanted anything to eat, but he shook his head. Then telling him to go to sleep, and that she would come down early in the morning and get him some breakfast, she bade him good-night and ascended the stairs. 

Almost immediately he fell into a heavy slumber, and did not wake till dawn.  At first he did not know where he was, but by degrees his situation cleared to him, and he beheld it in all the ghastliness of a right mind.  She knew the worst of him--the very worst.  How could he face her now?  She would soon be coming down to see about breakfast, as she had said, and there would he be in all his shame confronting her.  He could not bear the thought, and softly drawing on his boots, and taking his hat from the nail on which she had hung it, he slipped noiselessly out of the house. 

His fixed idea was to get away to some obscure spot and hide, and perhaps pray; and the only spot which occurred to him was Marygreen. He called at his lodging in Christminster, where he found awaiting him a note of dismissal from his employer; and having packed up he turned his back upon the city that had been such a thorn in his side, and struck southward into Wessex.  He had no money left in his pocket, his small savings, deposited at one of the banks in Christminster, having fortunately been left untouched.  To get to Marygreen, therefore, his only course was walking; and the distance being nearly twenty miles, he had ample time to complete on the way the sobering process begun in him. 

At some hour of the evening he reached Alfredston.  Here he pawned his waistcoat, and having gone out of the town a mile or two, slept under a rick that night.  At dawn he rose, shook off the hayseeds and stems from his clothes, and started again, breasting the long white road up the hill to the downs, which had been visible to him a long way off, and passing the milestone at the top, whereon he had carved his hopes years ago. 

He reached the ancient hamlet while the people were at breakfast. Weary and mud-bespattered, but quite possessed of his ordinary clearness of brain, he sat down by the well, thinking as he did so what a poor Christ he made.  Seeing a trough of water near he bathed his face, and went on to the cottage of his great-aunt, whom he found breakfasting in bed, attended by the woman who lived with her. 

"What--out o' work?" asked his relative, regarding him through eyes sunken deep, under lids heavy as pot-covers, no other cause for his tumbled appearance suggesting itself to one whose whole life had been a struggle with material things. 

"Yes," said Jude heavily.  "I think I must have a little rest." 

Refreshed by some breakfast, he went up to his old room and lay down in his shirt-sleeves, after the manner of the artizan.  He fell asleep for a short while, and when he awoke it was as if he had awakened in hell.  It WAS hell--"the hell of conscious failure," both in ambition and in love.  He thought of that previous abyss into which he had fallen before leaving this part of the country; the deepest deep he had supposed it then; but it was not so deep as this. That had been the breaking in of the outer bulwarks of his hope: this was of his second line. 

If he had been a woman he must have screamed under the nervous tension which he was now undergoing.  But that relief being denied to his virility, he clenched his teeth in misery, bringing lines about his mouth like those in the Laocoön, and corrugations between his brows. 

A mournful wind blew through the trees, and sounded in the chimney like the pedal notes of an organ.  Each ivy leaf overgrowing the wall of the churchless church-yard hard by, now abandoned, pecked its neighbour smartly, and the vane on the new Victorian-Gothic church in the new spot had already begun to creak.  Yet apparently it was not always the outdoor wind that made the deep murmurs; it was a voice. He guessed its origin in a moment or two; the curate was praying with his aunt in the adjoining room.  He remembered her speaking of him. Presently the sounds ceased, and a step seemed to cross the landing. Jude sat up, and shouted "Hoi!" 

The step made for his door, which was open, and a man looked in. It was a young clergyman. 

"I think you are Mr. Highridge," said Jude.  "My aunt has mentioned you more than once.  Well, here I am, just come home; a fellow gone to the bad; though I had the best intentions in the world at one time.  Now I am melancholy mad, what with drinking and one thing and another." 

Slowly Jude unfolded to the curate his late plans and movements, by an unconscious bias dwelling less upon the intellectual and ambitious side of his dream, and more upon the theological, though this had, up till now, been merely a portion of the general plan of advancement. 

"Now I know I have been a fool, and that folly is with me," added Jude in conclusion.  "And I don't regret the collapse of my university hopes one jot.  I wouldn't begin again if I were sure to succeed.  I don't care for social success any more at all.  But I do feel I should like to do some good thing; and I bitterly regret the Church, and the loss of my chance of being her ordained minister." 

The curate, who was a new man to this neighbourhood, had grown deeply interested, and at last he said: "If you feel a real call to the ministry, and I won't say from your conversation that you do not, for it is that of a thoughtful and educated man, you might enter the Church as a licentiate.  Only you must make up your mind to avoid strong drink." 

"I could avoid that easily enough, if I had any kind of hope to support me!"
