<ACTION>Enter Hector, with the body of the Greek in armor.</ACTION> 

HECTOR Most putrefied core, so fair without, Thy goodly armor thus hath cost thy life. Now is my day’s work done. I’ll take my breath. Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death. 

<ACTION>He begins to disarm.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Achilles and his Myrmidons.</ACTION> 

ACHILLES Look, Hector, how the sun begins to set,	 How ugly night comes breathing at his heels. Even with the vail and dark’ning of the sun To close the day up, Hector’s life is done. 

HECTOR I am unarmed. Forgo this vantage, Greek. 

ACHILLES Strike, fellows, strike! This is the man I seek.	 

<ACTION>The Myrmidons kill Hector.</ACTION> 

So, Ilium, fall thou next! Come, Troy, sink down! Here lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone. On, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain “Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain.” 

<ACTION>Retreat sounded from both armies.</ACTION> 

Hark! A retire upon our Grecian part.	 

A MYRMIDON The Trojan trumpets sound the like, my lord. 

ACHILLES The dragon wing of night o’erspreads the Earth And, stickler-like, the armies separates. My half-supped sword, that frankly would have fed, Pleased with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed.	 

<ACTION>He sheathes his sword.</ACTION> 

Come, tie his body to my horse’s tail; Along the field I will the Trojan trail. 

<ACTION>They exit with the bodies.</ACTION>
