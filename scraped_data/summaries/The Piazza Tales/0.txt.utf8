The narrator quotes from Shakespeare's Cymbeline. There's a lot of quoting in this story.

Narrator says he's moved out to the country, to a house without a piazza, or porch.

The lack of a piazza makes him sad.

Yes, that's an important plot point. The house has no porch—conflict!

This is not a two-fisted, pulse-pounding tale, in case you couldn't tell already.

The house is old; it's got a big elm tree by it.

You can also see Mount Greylock from the house, the highest peak in Massachusetts, (which you could see from Melville's real-life house at Arrowhead.)

The narrator compares Greylock to the ancient King Charlemagne, because that's the sort of labored, cutesy narrator you've got here.

Three paragraphs in, Shmoop doesn't know the narrator's name, but still, Shmoop would like to never know his name and never hear from him again.

Narrator decides to build a piazza. He wonders which side of the house to put it on. He hems and haws, but eventually decides on the north, so he can see Mount Greylock.

Folks laugh at the narrator for building a porch to the north, since that isn't usually where you put a porch. But the narrator is unconventional. Good for him.

Sitting on his porch reminds him of the sea, because Melville went to sea, and is famous for his sea tales. So this bit is kind of a branding exercise; he's letting readers know that they haven't wandered into the wrong restaurant.

At some point in his sitting on the porch, he spies a spot that interests him.

He tries looking at it over a year or so, but can never really pin it down.

What could it be? He's reading Midsummer's Night Dream, so it must be something fanciful and filled with fairy dust.

Fairy dust…ah…ah…choooo!

Excuse Shmoop.

The narrator is somewhat ill too, it sounds like. Not clear if he's sneezing though.

But despite illness he decides to set off for fairy land.

He fights Harry Potter in a duel to the death.

No, not really.

But somehow or other he gets to a pasture, and comes to a house.

He finds a girl named Marianna sewing at a window.

She lives with her brother, who is out most of the day, and so she is very lonely.

She can see the narrator's house from her window, and thinks whoever lives there must be happy.

That's irony, folks, because the narrator is melancholy too.

They talk about a passing cloud. Then they talk about the cloud some more. Not much happening in a story when you need to spend a page talking about a cloud.

The cloud's shadow looks like a dog. True story.

More talk about clouds, more Marianna being sad and lonely.

She wishes she could see whoever it is who lives in the house.

The narrator tells her he wishes he were the inhabitant of that happy house.

But then he's back at his piazza, and you realize the whole conversation with Marianns was a vain fancy.

Some people imagine unicorns and flying and explosions and exciting things when they daydream. The narrator just imagines some lonely person far off who watches clouds.

She haunts him with her unreal reality.

That's it. Yes, it's a whole story about sitting on a porch looking out while imagining someone else sitting by a window looking at you. And ocassionally talking about clouds.

The next story's better, Shmoop promises.
