Pete has no clue the trouble he hath wrought. Maggie has nowhere to turn, and not even Jimmie comes to her defense. But in-between thoughts of his new old love—"the woman of brilliance and audacity"—Pete feels some nagging guilt. He tries to push it away.

He really hopes Maggie doesn't go to the bar where he works; he already got a talking-to about keeping the place respectable.

So, of course, enter Maggie. She has nowhere to go, but Pete doesn't care (duh).

Maggie finds herself walking the streets, which is not a thing a "good" girl would do back then. Men are avoiding contact with her. No one will save her soul. She is extra doomed.
