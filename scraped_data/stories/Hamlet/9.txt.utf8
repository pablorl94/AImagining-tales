<ACTION>Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.</ACTION> 

KING I like him not, nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you. I your commission will forthwith dispatch, And he to England shall along with you. The terms of our estate may not endure	 Hazard so near ’s as doth hourly grow Out of his brows. 

GUILDENSTERN  We will ourselves provide. Most holy and religious fear it is To keep those many many bodies safe	 That live and feed upon your Majesty. 

ROSENCRANTZ The single and peculiar life is bound With all the strength and armor of the mind To keep itself from noyance, but much more That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests	 The lives of many. The cess of majesty Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw What’s near it with it; or it is a massy wheel Fixed on the summit of the highest mount, To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things	 Are mortised and adjoined, which, when it falls, Each small annexment, petty consequence, Attends the boist’rous ruin. Never alone Did the king sigh, but with a general groan. 

KING Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage,	 For we will fetters put about this fear, Which now goes too free-footed. 

ROSENCRANTZ We will haste us.

<ACTION>Enter Polonius.</ACTION> 

POLONIUS My lord, he’s going to his mother’s closet. Behind the arras I’ll convey myself	 To hear the process. I’ll warrant she’ll tax him home; And, as you said (and wisely was it said), ’Tis meet that some more audience than a mother, Since nature makes them partial, should o’erhear	 The speech of vantage. Fare you well, my liege. I’ll call upon you ere you go to bed And tell you what I know. 

KING Thanks, dear my lord. 

<ACTION>Polonius exits.</ACTION> 

O, my offense is rank, it smells to heaven;	 It hath the primal eldest curse upon ’t, A brother’s murder. Pray can I not, Though inclination be as sharp as will. My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent, And, like a man to double business bound,	 I stand in pause where I shall first begin And both neglect. What if this cursèd hand Were thicker than itself with brother’s blood? Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy	 But to confront the visage of offense? And what’s in prayer but this twofold force, To be forestallèd ere we come to fall, Or pardoned being down? Then I’ll look up. My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer	 Can serve my turn? “Forgive me my foul murder”? That cannot be, since I am still possessed Of those effects for which I did the murder: My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen. May one be pardoned and retain th’ offense? In the corrupted currents of this world, Offense’s gilded hand may shove by justice, And oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law. 

But ’tis not so above: There is no shuffling; there the action lies	 In his true nature, and we ourselves compelled, Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults, To give in evidence.What then? What rests? Try what repentance can. What can it not? Yet what can it, when one cannot repent? O wretched state! O bosom black as death! O limèd soul, that, struggling to be free, Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay. Bow, stubborn knees, and heart with strings of steel Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe. All may be well. 

<ACTION>He kneels.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Hamlet.</ACTION> 

HAMLET Now might I do it pat, now he is a-praying, And now I’ll do ’t.	He draws his sword. And so he goes to heaven, And so am I revenged. That would be scanned:	 A villain kills my father, and for that, I, his sole son, do this same villain send To heaven. Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge. He took my father grossly, full of bread,	 With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May; And how his audit stands who knows save heaven. But in our circumstance and course of thought ’Tis heavy with him. And am I then revenged To take him in the purging of his soul,	 When he is fit and seasoned for his passage? No. Up sword, and know thou a more horrid hent. He sheathes his sword. When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage, Or in th’ incestuous pleasure of his bed,	 At game, a-swearing, or about some act That has no relish of salvation in ’t— Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven, And that his soul may be as damned and black As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.	 This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.

KING ,  <ACTION>rising</ACTION> My words fly up, my thoughts remain below; Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
