<ACTION>The King enters with his power, crosses the stage andexits. Alarum to the battle. Then enter Douglas, and SirWalter Blunt, disguised as the King.</ACTION> 

BLUNT ,  <ACTION>as King</ACTION> What is thy name that in the battle thus Thou crossest me? What honor dost thou seek Upon my head? 

DOUGLAS Know then my name is Douglas, And I do haunt thee in the battle thus Because some tell me that thou art a king. 

BLUNT, <ACTION>as King</ACTION> They tell thee true. 

DOUGLAS The Lord of Stafford dear today hath bought Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry, This sword hath ended him. So shall it thee,	 Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner. 

BLUNT ,  <ACTION>as King</ACTION> I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot, And thou shalt find a king that will revenge Lord Stafford’s death. 

<ACTION>They fight. Douglas kills Blunt.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Then enter Hotspur.</ACTION> 

HOTSPUR O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,	 I never had triumphed upon a Scot. 

DOUGLAS All’s done, all’s won; here breathless lies the King. 

HOTSPUR Where? 

DOUGLAS   Here. 

HOTSPUR This, Douglas? No, I know this face full well.	 A gallant knight he was; his name was Blunt, Semblably furnished like the King himself. 

DOUGLAS ,  <ACTION>addressing Blunt’s corpse</ACTION> A fool go with thy soul whither it goes! A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear. Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?	 

HOTSPUR The King hath many marching in his coats. 

DOUGLAS Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats. I’ll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece, Until I meet the King. 

HOTSPUR Up and away!	 Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Alarm. Enter Falstaff alone.</ACTION> 

FALSTAFF  Though I could ’scape shot-free at London, I fear the shot here. Here’s no scoring but upon the pate.—Soft, who are you? Sir Walter Blunt. There’s honor for you. Here’s no vanity. I am as hot	 as molten lead, and as heavy too. God keep lead out of me; I need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have led my ragamuffins where they are peppered. There’s not three of my hundred and fifty left alive, and they are for the town’s end, to beg	 during life. But who comes here? 

<ACTION>Enter the Prince.</ACTION> 

PRINCE What, stand’st thou idle here? Lend me thy sword. Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies, Whose deaths are yet unrevenged. I prithee	 Lend me thy sword. 

FALSTAFF  O Hal, I prithee give me leave to breathe awhile. Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have done this day. I have paid Percy; I have made him sure. 

PRINCE He is indeed, and living to kill thee. I prithee, lend me thy sword. 

FALSTAFF Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou gett’st not my sword; but take my pistol, if thou wilt.		 

PRINCE Give it me. What, is it in the case? 

FALSTAFF Ay, Hal, ’tis hot, ’tis hot. There’s that will sack a city. 

<ACTION>The Prince draws it out, and finds itto be a bottle of sack.</ACTION> 

PRINCE What, is it a time to jest and dally now? 

<ACTION>He throws the bottle at him and exits.</ACTION> 

FALSTAFF Well, if Percy be alive, I’ll pierce him. If he do	 come in my way, so; if he do not, if I come in his willingly, let him make a carbonado of me. I like not such grinning honor as Sir Walter hath. Give me life, which, if I can save, so: if not, honor comes unlooked for, and there’s an end.	 

<ACTION>He exits. Blunt’s body is carried off.</ACTION>
