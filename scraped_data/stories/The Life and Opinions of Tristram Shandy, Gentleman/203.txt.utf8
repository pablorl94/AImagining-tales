Chapter 3.LXXXVI. 

It is a great inconvenience to a man in a haste, that there are three distinct roads between Calais and Paris, in behalf of which there is so much to be said by the several deputies from the towns which lie along them, that half a day is easily lost in settling which you'll take. 

First, the road by Lisle and Arras, which is the most about--but most interesting, and instructing. 

The second, that by Amiens, which you may go, if you would see Chantilly-- 

And that by Beauvais, which you may go, if you will. 

For this reason a great many chuse to go by Beauvais.
