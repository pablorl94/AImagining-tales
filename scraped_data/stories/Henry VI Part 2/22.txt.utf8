<ACTION>The sign of the Castle Inn is displayed. Alarms.Enter Warwick, wearing the white rose.</ACTION> 

WARWICK Clifford of Cumberland, ’tis Warwick calls! An if thou dost not hide thee from the bear, Now, when the angry trumpet sounds alarum And dead men’s cries do fill the empty air, Clifford, I say, come forth and fight with me;	 Proud northern lord, Clifford of Cumberland, Warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms. 

<ACTION>Enter York, wearing the white rose.</ACTION> 

How now, my noble lord? What, all afoot? 

YORK The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed, But match to match I have encountered him	 And made a prey for carrion kites and crows Even of the bonny beast he loved so well. 

<ACTION>Enter old Clifford, wearing the red rose.</ACTION> 

WARWICK Of one or both of us the time is come. 

YORK Hold, Warwick! Seek thee out some other chase, For I myself must hunt this deer to death. 

WARWICK Then, nobly, York! ’Tis for a crown thou fight’st.— As I intend, Clifford, to thrive today, It grieves my soul to leave thee unassailed. <ACTION>Warwick exits.</ACTION> 

CLIFFORD What seest thou in me, York? Why dost thou pause? 

YORK With thy brave bearing should I be in love,	 But that thou art so fast mine enemy. 

CLIFFORD Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem, But that ’tis shown ignobly and in treason. 

YORK So let it help me now against thy sword As I in justice and true right express it!	 

CLIFFORD My soul and body on the action both! 

YORK A dreadful lay! Address thee instantly. <ACTION>They fight and Clifford falls.</ACTION> 

CLIFFORD La fin courrone les oeuvres.	 <ACTION>He dies</ACTION> . 

YORK Thus war hath given thee peace, for thou art still. Peace with his soul, heaven, if it be thy will!	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter young Clifford, wearing the red rose.</ACTION> 

YOUNG CLIFFORD Shame and confusion! All is on the rout. Fear frames disorder, and disorder wounds Where it should guard. O war, thou son of hell, Whom angry heavens do make their minister, Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part	 Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly. He that is truly dedicate to war Hath no self-love; nor he that loves himself Hath not essentially, but by circumstance, The name of valor. He sees his father, lying dead. O,	 let the vile world end And the premised flames of the last day Knit Earth and heaven together! Now let the general trumpet blow his blast, Particularities and petty sounds	 To cease! Wast thou ordained, dear father, To lose thy youth in peace, and to achieve The silver livery of advisèd age, And, in thy reverence and thy chair-days, thus To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight	 My heart is turned to stone, and while ’tis mine, It shall be stony. York not our old men spares; No more will I their babes. Tears virginal Shall be to me even as the dew to fire; And beauty, that the tyrant oft reclaims,	 Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax. 

Henceforth I will not have to do with pity.Meet I an infant of the house of York, Into as many gobbets will I cut it As wild Medea young Absyrtis did. In cruelty will I seek out my fame. He takes his father’s body onto his back. Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford’s house; As did Aeneas old Anchises bear, So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders. But then Aeneas bare a living load,	 Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine. <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Richard, wearing the white rose, and Somerset,wearing the red rose, to fight.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Richard kills Somerset under the sign of Castle Inn.</ACTION> 

RICHARD  So lie thou there. For underneath an alehouse’ paltry sign, The Castle in Saint Albans, Somerset Hath made the wizard famous in his death.	 Sword, hold thy temper! Heart, be wrathful still! Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill.  

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Fight. Excursions. Enter King Henry, QueenMargaret, both wearing the red rose, and Others.</ACTION> 

QUEEN MARGARET Away, my lord! You are slow. For shame, away! 

KING HENRY Can we outrun the heavens? Good Margaret, stay! 

QUEEN MARGARET What are you made of? You’ll nor fight nor fly.	 Now is it manhood, wisdom, and defense To give the enemy way, and to secure us By what we can, which can no more but fly. 

<ACTION>Alarum afar off.</ACTION> 

If you be ta’en, we then should see the bottom Of all our fortunes; but if we haply scape,	 As well we may—if not through your neglect— We shall to London get, where you are loved And where this breach now in our fortunes made May readily be stopped. 

<ACTION>Enter Young Clifford, wearing the red rose.</ACTION> 

YOUNG CLIFFORD But that my heart’s on future mischief set,	 I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly; But fly you must. Uncurable discomfit Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts. Away, for your relief! And we will live To see their day and them our fortune give.	 Away, my lord, away! 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
