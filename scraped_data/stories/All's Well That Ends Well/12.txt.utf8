<ACTION>A tucket afar off. Enter old Widow of Florence, herdaughter Diana, and Mariana, with other Citizens.</ACTION> 

WIDOW  Nay, come, for if they do approach the city, we shall lose all the sight. 

DIANA  They say the French count has done most honorable service. 

WIDOW It is reported that he has taken their great’st	 commander, and that with his own hand he slew the Duke’s brother.  <ACTION>A trumpet sounds. </ACTION> We have lost our labor. They are gone a contrary way. Hark, you may know by their trumpets. 

MARIANA  Come, let’s return again and suffice ourselves	 with the report of it.—Well, Diana, take heed of this French earl. The honor of a maid is her name, and no legacy is so rich as honesty. 

WIDOW , <ACTION> to Diana</ACTION> I have told my neighbor how you have been solicited by a gentleman, his	 companion. 

MARIANA I know that knave, hang him! One Parolles, a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl.—Beware of them, Diana. Their promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these	 engines of lust are not the things they go under. Many a maid hath been seduced by them; and the misery is example that so terrible shows in the wrack of maidenhood cannot for all that dissuade succession, but that they are limed with the twigs	 that threatens them. I hope I need not to advise you further, but I hope your own grace will keep you where you are, though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost. 

DIANA You shall not need to fear me.	 

WIDOW I hope so. 

<ACTION>Enter Helen as a pilgrim.</ACTION> 

Look, here comes a pilgrim. I know she will lie at my house; thither they send one another. I’ll question her.—God save you, pilgrim. Whither are bound?	 

HELEN ,  <ACTION>as pilgrim</ACTION> To Saint Jaques le Grand. Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you? 

WIDOW At the Saint Francis here beside the port. 

HELEN ,  <ACTION>as pilgrim</ACTION> Is this the way?	 

<ACTION>A march afar.</ACTION> 

WIDOW Ay, marry, is ’t.—Hark you, they come this way.—	 If you will tarry, holy pilgrim, But till the troops come by, I will conduct you where you shall be lodged, The rather for I think I know your hostess As ample as myself.	 

HELEN , <ACTION> as pilgrim </ACTION> Is it yourself? 

WIDOW If you shall please so, pilgrim. 

HELEN , <ACTION> as pilgrim</ACTION> I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure. 

WIDOW You came I think from France? 

HELEN , <ACTION> as pilgrim</ACTION> I did so.	 

WIDOW Here you shall see a countryman of yours That has done worthy service. 

HELEN ,  <ACTION>as pilgrim</ACTION> His name, I pray you? 

DIANA The Count Rossillion. Know you such a one? 

HELEN , <ACTION> as pilgrim</ACTION> But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him.	 His face I know not. 

DIANA Whatsome’er he is, He’s bravely taken here. He stole from France, As ’tis reported, for the King had married him Against his liking. Think you it is so?	 

HELEN , <ACTION> as pilgrim</ACTION> Ay, surely, mere the truth. I know his lady. 

DIANA There is a gentleman that serves the Count Reports but coarsely of her. 

HELEN ,  <ACTION>as pilgrim</ACTION> What’s his name? 

DIANA Monsieur Parolles.	 

HELEN ,  <ACTION>as pilgrim </ACTION> O, I believe with him. In argument of praise, or to the worth Of the great count himself, she is too mean To have her name repeated. All her deserving Is a reservèd honesty, and that	 I have not heard examined. 

DIANA Alas, poor lady, ’Tis a hard bondage to become the wife Of a detesting lord. 

WIDOW I warrant, good creature, wheresoe’er she is,	 Her heart weighs sadly. This young maid might do her A shrewd turn if she pleased. 

HELEN , <ACTION> as pilgrim</ACTION> How do you mean? Maybe the amorous count solicits her	 In the unlawful purpose? 

WIDOW He does indeed, And brokes with all that can in such a suit Corrupt the tender honor of a maid, But she is armed for him and keeps her guard	 In honestest defense. 

MARIANA The gods forbid else! 

Drum and Colors. Enter Bertram Count Rossillion, Parolles, and the whole Army. 

WIDOW So, now they come. That is Antonio, the Duke’s eldest son; That, Escalus.	 

HELEN , <ACTION> as pilgrim</ACTION> Which is the Frenchman? 

DIANA He, That with the plume. ’Tis a most gallant fellow. I would he loved his wife. If he were honester, He were much goodlier. Is ’t not a handsome	 gentleman? 

HELEN , <ACTION> as pilgrim</ACTION> I like him well. 

DIANA ’Tis pity he is not honest. Yond’s that same knave That leads him to these places. Were I his lady, I would poison that vile rascal.	 

HELEN ,  <ACTION>as pilgrim</ACTION> Which is he? 

DIANA That jackanapes with scarves. Why is he melancholy? 

HELEN , <ACTION> as pilgrim</ACTION> Perchance he’s hurt i’ th’ battle. 

PAROLLES Lose our drum? Well. 

MARIANA He’s shrewdly vexed at something. Look, he	 has spied us. 

WIDOW ,  <ACTION>to Parolles</ACTION> Marry, hang you. 

MARIANA ,  <ACTION>to Parolles </ACTION> And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier. 

<ACTION>Bertram, Parolles, and the army exit.</ACTION> 

WIDOW The troop is passed. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you	 Where you shall host. Of enjoined penitents There’s four or five, to Great Saint Jaques bound, Already at my house. 

HELEN ,  <ACTION>as pilgrim </ACTION> I humbly thank you. Please it this matron and this gentle maid	 To eat with us tonight, the charge and thanking Shall be for me. And to requite you further, I will bestow some precepts of this virgin Worthy the note. 

BOTH We’ll take your offer kindly.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
