<ACTION>Enter Somerset with his army and a Captainfrom Talbot’s army.</ACTION> 

SOMERSET It is too late; I cannot send them now. This expedition was by York and Talbot Too rashly plotted. All our general force Might with a sally of the very town Be buckled with. The overdaring Talbot	 Hath sullied all his gloss of former honor By this unheedful, desperate, wild adventure. York set him on to fight and die in shame That, Talbot dead, great York might bear the name. 

<ACTION>Enter Sir William Lucy.</ACTION> 

CAPTAIN Here is Sir William Lucy, who with me	 Set from our o’er-matched forces forth for aid. 

SOMERSET How now, Sir William, whither were you sent? 

LUCY Whither, my lord? From bought and sold Lord Talbot, Who, ringed about with bold adversity, Cries out for noble York and Somerset	 To beat assailing Death from his weak regions; And whiles the honorable captain there Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs And, in advantage ling’ring, looks for rescue, You, his false hopes, the trust of England’s honor, Keep off aloof with worthless emulation. Let not your private discord keep away The levied succors that should lend him aid, While he, renownèd noble gentleman, Yield up his life unto a world of odds. Orleance the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy, Alanson, Reignier compass him about, And Talbot perisheth by your default. 

SOMERSET York set him on; York should have sent him aid. 

LUCY And York as fast upon your Grace exclaims,	 Swearing that you withhold his levied host Collected for this expedition. 

SOMERSET York lies. He might have sent and had the horse. I owe him little duty and less love, And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending.	 

LUCY The fraud of England, not the force of France, Hath now entrapped the noble-minded Talbot. Never to England shall he bear his life, But dies betrayed to fortune by your strife. 

SOMERSET Come, go. I will dispatch the horsemen straight.	 Within six hours they will be at his aid. 

LUCY Too late comes rescue; he is ta’en or slain, For fly he could not if he would have fled; And fly would Talbot never, though he might. 

SOMERSET If he be dead, brave Talbot, then adieu.	 

LUCY His fame lives in the world, his shame in you. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Talbot and John Talbot, his son.</ACTION> 

TALBOT O young John Talbot, I did send for thee To tutor thee in stratagems of war, That Talbot’s name might be in thee revived When sapless age and weak unable limbs Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.	 But—O, malignant and ill-boding stars!— Now thou art come unto a feast of Death, A terrible and unavoided danger. Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse, And I’ll direct thee how thou shalt escape	 By sudden flight. Come, dally not, be gone. 

JOHN TALBOT Is my name Talbot? And am I your son? And shall I fly? O, if you love my mother, Dishonor not her honorable name To make a bastard and a slave of me!	 The world will say “He is not Talbot’s blood, That basely fled when noble Talbot stood.” 

TALBOT Fly, to revenge my death if I be slain. 

JOHN TALBOT He that flies so will ne’er return again. 

TALBOT If we both stay, we both are sure to die.	 

JOHN TALBOT Then let me stay and, father, do you fly. Your loss is great; so your regard should be. My worth unknown, no loss is known in me. Upon my death, the French can little boast; In yours they will; in you all hopes are lost.	 Flight cannot stain the honor you have won, But mine it will, that no exploit have done. You fled for vantage, everyone will swear; But if I bow, they’ll say it was for fear. There is no hope that ever I will stay	 If the first hour I shrink and run away.	 <ACTION>He kneels.</ACTION> Here on my knee I beg mortality, Rather than life preserved with infamy. 

TALBOT Shall all thy mother’s hopes lie in one tomb? 

JOHN TALBOT Ay, rather than I’ll shame my mother’s womb.	 

TALBOT Upon my blessing I command thee go. 

JOHN TALBOT To fight I will, but not to fly the foe. 

TALBOT Part of thy father may be saved in thee. 

JOHN TALBOT No part of him but will be shame in me. 

TALBOT Thou never hadst renown, nor canst not lose it.	 

JOHN TALBOT Yes, your renownèd name; shall flight abuse it? 

TALBOT Thy father’s charge shall clear thee from that stain. 

JOHN TALBOT You cannot witness for me, being slain. If death be so apparent, then both fly. 

TALBOT And leave my followers here to fight and die?	 My age was never tainted with such shame. 

JOHN TALBOT And shall my youth be guilty of such blame? <ACTION>He rises.</ACTION> No more can I be severed from your side Than can yourself yourself in twain divide. Stay, go, do what you will; the like do I,	 For live I will not, if my father die. 

TALBOT Then here I take my leave of thee, fair son, Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon. Come, side by side, together live and die, And soul with soul from France to heaven fly.	 <ACTION>They exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Alarum. Excursions, wherein Talbot’s son Johnis hemmed about, and Talbot rescues him.</ACTION> 

TALBOT Saint George, and victory! Fight, soldiers, fight! The Regent hath with Talbot broke his word And left us to the rage of France his sword. Where is John Talbot?—Pause, and take thy breath; I gave thee life and rescued thee from death. 

JOHN TALBOT O, twice my father, twice am I thy son! The life thou gav’st me first was lost and done Till with thy warlike sword, despite of fate, To my determined time thou gav’st new date. 

TALBOT When from the Dauphin’s crest thy sword struck fire,	 It warmed thy father’s heart with proud desire Of bold-faced victory. Then leaden age, Quickened with youthful spleen and warlike rage, Beat down Alanson, Orleance, Burgundy, And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee. The ireful Bastard Orleance, that drew blood From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood Of thy first fight, I soon encounterèd, And, interchanging blows, I quickly shed Some of his bastard blood, and in disgrace	 Bespoke him thus: “Contaminated, base, And misbegotten blood I spill of thine, Mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy.” Here, purposing the Bastard to destroy,	 Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy father’s care: Art thou not weary, John? How dost thou fare? Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly, Now thou art sealed the son of chivalry? Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead;	 The help of one stands me in little stead. O, too much folly is it, well I wot, To hazard all our lives in one small boat. 

If I today die not with Frenchmen’s rage, Tomorrow I shall die with mickle age.By me they nothing gain, and, if I stay, ’Tis but the short’ning of my life one day. In thee thy mother dies, our household’s name, My death’s revenge, thy youth, and England’s fame. All these and more we hazard by thy stay;	 All these are saved if thou wilt fly away. 

JOHN TALBOT The sword of Orleance hath not made me smart; These words of yours draw lifeblood from my heart. On that advantage, bought with such a shame, To save a paltry life and slay bright fame,	 Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly, The coward horse that bears me fall and die! And like me to the peasant boys of France, To be shame’s scorn and subject of mischance! Surely, by all the glory you have won,	 An if I fly, I am not Talbot’s son. Then talk no more of flight, it is no boot; If son to Talbot, die at Talbot’s foot. 

TALBOT Then follow thou thy desp’rate sire of Crete, Thou Icarus; thy life to me is sweet.	 If thou wilt fight, fight by thy father’s side, And commendable proved, let’s die in pride. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Alarum. Excursions. Enter old Talbotled by a Servant.</ACTION> 

TALBOT Where is my other life? Mine own is gone. O, where’s young Talbot? Where is valiant John? Triumphant Death, smeared with captivity, Young Talbot’s valor makes me smile at thee. When he perceived me shrink and on my knee,	 His bloody sword he brandished over me, And like a hungry lion did commence Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience; But when my angry guardant stood alone, Tend’ring my ruin and assailed of none,	 Dizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart Suddenly made him from my side to start Into the clust’ring battle of the French; And in that sea of blood, my boy did drench His over-mounting spirit; and there died	 My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride. 

<ACTION>Enter Soldiers with John Talbot, borne.</ACTION> 

SERVINGMAN O, my dear lord, lo where your son is borne! 

TALBOT Thou antic Death, which laugh’st us here to scorn, Anon from thy insulting tyranny, Coupled in bonds of perpetuity,	 Two Talbots, wingèd through the lither sky, In thy despite shall scape mortality.— O, thou whose wounds become hard-favored Death, Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath! Brave Death by speaking, whither he will or no.	 Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.— Poor boy, he smiles, methinks, as who should say “Had Death been French, then Death had died today.”— Come, come, and lay him in his father’s arms;	 My spirit can no longer bear these harms. Soldiers, adieu! I have what I would have, Now my old arms are young John Talbot’s grave. 

<ACTION>Dies.Alarums. Soldiers exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Charles, Alanson, Burgundy, Bastard,and Pucelle, with Forces.</ACTION> 

CHARLES Had York and Somerset brought rescue in, We should have found a bloody day of this. 

BASTARD How the young whelp of Talbot’s, raging wood, Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen’s blood! 

PUCELLE Once I encountered him, and thus I said: “Thou maiden youth, be vanquished by a maid.” But with a proud majestical high scorn	 He answered thus: “Young Talbot was not born To be the pillage of a giglot wench.” So, rushing in the bowels of the French, He left me proudly, as unworthy fight. 

BURGUNDY Doubtless he would have made a noble knight.	 See where he lies inhearsèd in the arms Of the most bloody nurser of his harms. 

BASTARD Hew them to pieces, hack their bones asunder, Whose life was England’s glory, Gallia’s wonder. 

CHARLES O, no, forbear! For that which we have fled	 During the life, let us not wrong it dead. 

<ACTION>Enter Lucy with Attendants and a French Herald.</ACTION> 

LUCY Herald, conduct me to the Dauphin’s tent, To know who hath obtained the glory of the day. 

CHARLES On what submissive message art thou sent? 

LUCY Submission, dauphin? ’Tis a mere French word. We English warriors wot not what it means. I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta’en, And to survey the bodies of the dead. 

CHARLES For prisoners askst thou? Hell our prison is. But tell me whom thou seek’st.	 

LUCY But where’s the great Alcides of the field, Valiant Lord Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, Created for his rare success in arms Great Earl of Washford, Waterford, and Valence, Lord Talbot of Goodrich and Urchinfield, Lord Strange of Blackmere, Lord Verdon of Alton, Lord Cromwell of Wingfield, Lord Furnival of Sheffield, The thrice victorious Lord of Falconbridge, Knight of the noble Order of Saint George,	 Worthy Saint Michael, and the Golden Fleece, Great Marshal to Henry the Sixth Of all his wars within the realm of France? 

PUCELLE Here’s a silly stately style indeed. The Turk, that two-and-fifty kingdoms hath,	 Writes not so tedious a style as this. Him that thou magnifi’st with all these titles Stinking and flyblown lies here at our feet. 

LUCY Is Talbot slain, the Frenchmen’s only scourge, Your kingdom’s terror and black Nemesis?	 O, were mine eyeballs into bullets turned That I in rage might shoot them at your faces! O, that I could but call these dead to life, It were enough to fright the realm of France. Were but his picture left amongst you here,	 It would amaze the proudest of you all. Give me their bodies, that I may bear them hence And give them burial as beseems their worth. 

PUCELLE I think this upstart is old Talbot’s ghost, He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit.	 For God’s sake, let him have him. To keep them here, They would but stink and putrefy the air. 

CHARLES Go, take their bodies hence. 

LUCY I’ll bear them hence. But from their ashes shall be reared	 A phoenix that shall make all France afeard. 

CHARLES So we be rid of them, do with him what thou wilt. 

<ACTION>Lucy, Servant, and Attendants exit,bearing the bodies.</ACTION> 

And now to Paris in this conquering vein. All will be ours, now bloody Talbot’s slain. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
