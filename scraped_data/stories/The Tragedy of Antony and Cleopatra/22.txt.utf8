<ACTION>Enter Antony with Attendants.</ACTION> 

ANTONY Hark, the land bids me tread no more upon ’t. It is ashamed to bear me. Friends, come hither. I am so lated in the world that I Have lost my way forever. I have a ship Laden with gold. Take that, divide it. Fly,	 And make your peace with Caesar. 

ALL Fly? Not we! 

ANTONY I have fled myself and have instructed cowards To run and show their shoulders. Friends, begone. I have myself resolved upon a course	 Which has no need of you. Begone. My treasure’s in the harbor; take it. O, I followed that I blush to look upon! My very hairs do mutiny, for the white Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them	 For fear and doting. Friends, begone. You shall Have letters from me to some friends that will Sweep your way for you. Pray you look not sad, Nor make replies of loathness. Take the hint Which my despair proclaims. Let that be left	 Which leaves itself. To the seaside straightway! I will possess you of that ship and treasure. Leave me, I pray, a little—pray you, now, Nay, do so—for indeed I have lost command. Therefore I pray you—I’ll see you by and by.	 

<ACTION>Attendants move aside. Antony sits down.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Cleopatra led by Charmian, Iras, and Eros.</ACTION> 

EROS Nay, gentle madam, to him, comfort him. 

IRAS Do, most dear queen. 

CHARMIAN Do! Why, what else? 

CLEOPATRA Let me sit down. O Juno!	 <ACTION>She sits down.</ACTION> 

ANTONY  No, no, no, no, no.	 

EROS See you here, sir? 

ANTONY Oh fie, fie, fie! 

CHARMIAN  Madam. 

IRAS Madam, O good empress! 

EROS Sir, sir—	 

ANTONY Yes, my lord, yes. He at Philippi kept His sword e’en like a dancer, while I struck The lean and wrinkled Cassius, and ’twas I That the mad Brutus ended. He alone Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practice had	 In the brave squares of war, yet now—no matter. 

CLEOPATRA Ah, stand by. 

EROS  The Queen, my lord, the Queen. 

IRAS Go to him, madam; speak to him. He’s unqualitied with very shame.	 

CLEOPATRA ,  <ACTION>rising </ACTION> Well, then, sustain me. O! 

EROS Most noble sir, arise. The Queen approaches. Her head’s declined, and death will seize her but Your comfort makes the rescue. 

ANTONY  I have offended reputation,	 A most unnoble swerving. 

EROS  Sir, the Queen. 

ANTONY ,  <ACTION>rising</ACTION> O, whither hast them led me, Egypt? See How I convey my shame out of thine eyes, By looking back what I have left behind	 ’Stroyed in dishonor. 

CLEOPATRA O, my lord, my lord, Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought You would have followed. 

ANTONY Egypt, thou knew’st too well	 My heart was to thy rudder tied by th’ strings, And thou shouldst tow me after. O’er my spirit Thy full supremacy thou knew’st, and that Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods Command me.   

CLEOPATRA O, my pardon! 

ANTONY Now I must To the young man send humble treaties, dodge And palter in the shifts of lowness, who With half the bulk o’ th’ world played as I pleased,	 Making and marring fortunes. You did know How much you were my conqueror, and that My sword, made weak by my affection, would Obey it on all cause. 

CLEOPATRA Pardon, pardon!	 

ANTONY Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates All that is won and lost. Give me a kiss.	They kiss. Even this repays me.— We sent our schoolmaster. Is he come back?— Love, I am full of lead.—Some wine	 Within there, and our viands! Fortune knows We scorn her most when most she offers blows. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
