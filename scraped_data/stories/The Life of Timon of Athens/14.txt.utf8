<ACTION>Enter two other Senators, with a Messenger.</ACTION> 

THIRD SENATOR Thou hast painfully discovered. Are his files As full as thy report? 

MESSENGER I have spoke the least. Besides, his expedition promises Present approach.	 

FOURTH SENATOR We stand much hazard if they bring not Timon. 

MESSENGER I met a courier, one mine ancient friend, Whom, though in general part we were opposed, Yet our old love made a particular force And made us speak like friends. This man was riding	 From Alcibiades to Timon’s cave With letters of entreaty which imported His fellowship i’ th’ cause against your city, In part for his sake moved. 

<ACTION>Enter the other Senators.</ACTION> 

THIRD SENATOR Here come our brothers.	 

FIRST SENATOR No talk of Timon; nothing of him expect. The enemy’s drum is heard, and fearful scouring Doth choke the air with dust. In, and prepare. Ours is the fall, I fear, our foe’s the snare. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
