<ACTION>Enter a Third Servant of Timon’s with Sempronius,another of Timon’s friends.</ACTION> 

SEMPRONIUS Must he needs trouble me in ’t? Hum! ’Bove all others? He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus; And now Ventidius is wealthy too, Whom he redeemed from prison. All these Owes their estates unto him.	 

SERVANT My lord, They have all been touched and found base metal, For they have all denied him. 

SEMPRONIUS How? Have they denied him? Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him,	 And does he send to me? Three? Humh! It shows but little love or judgment in him. Must I be his last refuge? His friends, like physicians, Thrive, give him over. Must I take th’ cure upon me? Has much disgraced me in ’t. I’m angry at him	 That might have known my place. I see no sense for ’t But his occasions might have wooed me first; For, in my conscience, I was the first man That e’er received gift from him. And does he think so backwardly of me now	 That I’ll requite it last? No. So it may prove an argument of laughter To th’ rest, and I ’mongst lords be thought a fool. I’d rather than the worth of thrice the sum Had sent to me first, but for my mind’s sake;	 I’d such a courage to do him good. But now return, And with their faint reply this answer join: Who bates mine honor shall not know my coin.

SERVANT Excellent! Your Lordship’s a goodly villain. The devil knew not what he did when he made	 man politic. He crossed himself by ’t, and I cannot think but, in the end, the villainies of man will set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to appear foul! Takes virtuous copies to be wicked, like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms	 on fire. Of such a nature is his politic love. This was my lord’s best hope. Now all are fled, Save only the gods. Now his friends are dead, Doors that were ne’er acquainted with their wards	 Many a bounteous year must be employed Now to guard sure their master. And this is all a liberal course allows: Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.
