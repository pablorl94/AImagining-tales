<ACTION>Enter Prospero in his magic robes, and Ariel.</ACTION> 

PROSPERO Now does my project gather to a head. My charms crack not, my spirits obey, and time Goes upright with his carriage.—How’s the day? 

ARIEL On the sixth hour, at which time, my lord, You said our work should cease.	 

PROSPERO I did say so When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit, How fares the King and ’s followers? 

ARIEL Confined together	 In the same fashion as you gave in charge, Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir, In the line grove which weather-fends your cell. They cannot budge till your release. The King, His brother, and yours abide all three distracted,	 And the remainder mourning over them, Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly Him that you termed, sir, the good old Lord Gonzalo. His tears runs down his beard like winter’s drops	 From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works ’em That if you now beheld them, your affections Would become tender. 

PROSPERO Dost thou think so, spirit?	 

ARIEL Mine would, sir, were I human. 

PROSPERO And mine shall. Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling Of their afflictions, and shall not myself, One of their kind, that relish all as sharply	 Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art? Though with their high wrongs I am struck to th’ quick, Yet with my nobler reason ’gainst my fury Do I take part. The rarer action is	 In virtue than in vengeance. They being penitent, The sole drift of my purpose doth extend Not a frown further. Go, release them, Ariel. My charms I’ll break, their senses I’ll restore, And they shall be themselves.	 

ARIEL I’ll fetch them, sir. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Prospero draws a large circle on the stage with his staff.</ACTION> 

PROSPERO You elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves, And you that on the sands with printless foot Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him When he comes back; you demi-puppets that	 By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make, Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime Is to make midnight mushrumps, that rejoice To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid, Weak masters though you be, I have bedimmed	 The noontide sun, called forth the mutinous winds, And ’twixt the green sea and the azured vault Set roaring war; to the dread rattling thunder Have I given fire, and rifted Jove’s stout oak With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory	 Have I made shake, and by the spurs plucked up The pine and cedar; graves at my command Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let ’em forth By my so potent art. 

But this rough magic I here abjure, and when I have required	 Some heavenly music, which even now I do, <ACTION>Prospero gestures with his staff.</ACTION> To work mine end upon their senses that This airy charm is for, I’ll break my staff, Bury it certain fathoms in the earth, And deeper than did ever plummet sound	 I’ll drown my book.<ACTION>Solemn music.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Here enters Ariel before; then Alonso with a franticgesture, attended by Gonzalo; Sebastian and Antonio inlike manner attended by Adrian and Francisco. They allenter the circle which Prospero had made, and therestand charmed; which Prospero observing, speaks.</ACTION> 

A solemn air, and the best comforter To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains, Now useless, boiled within thy skull. There stand, For you are spell-stopped.—	 Holy Gonzalo, honorable man, Mine eyes, e’en sociable to the show of thine, Fall fellowly drops.—The charm dissolves apace, And as the morning steals upon the night, Melting the darkness, so their rising senses	 Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle Their clearer reason.—O good Gonzalo, My true preserver and a loyal sir To him thou follow’st, I will pay thy graces Home, both in word and deed.—Most cruelly	 Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter. Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.— Thou art pinched for ’t now, Sebastian.—Flesh and blood, You, brother mine, that entertained ambition,	 Expelled remorse and nature, whom, with Sebastian, Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong, Would here have killed your king, I do forgive thee, Unnatural though thou art.—Their understanding Begins to swell, and the approaching tide	 Will shortly fill the reasonable shore That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them That yet looks on me or would know me.—Ariel, Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell. 

<ACTION>Ariel exits and at once returnswith Prospero’s ducal robes.</ACTION> 

I will discase me and myself present	 As I was sometime Milan.—Quickly, spirit, Thou shalt ere long be free. 

ARIEL <ACTION>sings, and helps to attire him.</ACTION> 

"Where the bee sucks, there suck I. In a cowslip’s bell I lie. There I couch when owls do cry.	 On the bat’s back I do fly After summer merrily. Merrily, merrily shall I live now Under the blossom that hangs on the bow." 

PROSPERO Why, that’s my dainty Ariel. I shall miss	 Thee, but yet thou shalt have freedom. So, so, so. To the King’s ship, invisible as thou art. There shalt thou find the mariners asleep Under the hatches. The master and the boatswain Being awake, enforce them to this place,	 And presently, I prithee. 

ARIEL I drink the air before me, and return Or ere your pulse twice beat. <ACTION>	He exits.</ACTION> 

GONZALO All torment, trouble, wonder, and amazement Inhabits here. Some heavenly power guide us	 Out of this fearful country! 

PROSPERO ,  <ACTION>to Alonso </ACTION> Behold, sir king, The wrongèd Duke of Milan, Prospero. For more assurance that a living prince Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body,	 <ACTION>He embraces Alonso.</ACTION> And to thee and thy company I bid A hearty welcome. 

ALONSO Whe’er thou be’st he or no, Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me (As late I have been) I not know. Thy pulse	 Beats as of flesh and blood; and since I saw thee, Th’ affliction of my mind amends, with which I fear a madness held me. This must crave, An if this be at all, a most strange story. Thy dukedom I resign, and do entreat	 Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero Be living and be here? 

PROSPERO ,  <ACTION>to Gonzalo</ACTION> First, noble friend, Let me embrace thine age, whose honor cannot	 Be measured or confined. 

GONZALO Whether this be Or be not, I’ll not swear. 

PROSPERO You do yet taste Some subtleties o’ th’ isle, that will not let you	 Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all. Aside to Sebastian and Antonio. But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded, I here could pluck his Highness’ frown upon you And justify you traitors. At this time	 I will tell no tales. 

SEBASTIAN ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> The devil speaks in him. 

PROSPERO , <ACTION> aside to Sebastian</ACTION> No. <ACTION>To Antonio.</ACTION> For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother	 Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive Thy rankest fault, all of them, and require My dukedom of thee, which perforce I know Thou must restore. 

ALONSO If thou be’st Prospero,	 Give us particulars of thy preservation, How thou hast met us here, whom three hours since Were wracked upon this shore, where I have lost— How sharp the point of this remembrance is!— My dear son Ferdinand.	 

PROSPERO I am woe for ’t, sir. 

ALONSO Irreparable is the loss, and patience Says it is past her cure. 

PROSPERO I rather think You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace,	 For the like loss, I have her sovereign aid And rest myself content. 

ALONSO You the like loss? 

PROSPERO As great to me as late, and supportable To make the dear loss have I means much weaker	 Than you may call to comfort you, for I Have lost my daughter. 

ALONSO A daughter? O heavens, that they were living both in Naples, The King and Queen there! That they were, I wish	 Myself were mudded in that oozy bed Where my son lies!—When did you lose your daughter? 

PROSPERO In this last tempest. I perceive these lords At this encounter do so much admire	 That they devour their reason, and scarce think Their eyes do offices of truth, their words Are natural breath.—But howsoe’er you have Been justled from your senses, know for certain That I am Prospero and that very duke	 Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely Upon this shore, where you were wracked, was landed To be the lord on ’t. No more yet of this.	 For ’tis a chronicle of day by day, Not a relation for a breakfast, nor Befitting this first meeting.  <ACTION>To Alonso. </ACTION> Welcome, sir. This cell’s my court. Here have I few attendants, And subjects none abroad. Pray you, look in.	 My dukedom since you have given me again, I will requite you with as good a thing, At least bring forth a wonder to content you As much as me my dukedom. 

<ACTION>Here Prospero discovers Ferdinand and Miranda,playing at chess.</ACTION> 

MIRANDA , <ACTION> to Ferdinand</ACTION> Sweet lord, you play me false.	 

FERDINAND No, my dearest love, I would not for the world. 

MIRANDA Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle, And I would call it fair play. 

ALONSO If this prove	 A vision of the island, one dear son Shall I twice lose. 

SEBASTIAN A most high miracle! 

FERDINAND ,  <ACTION>seeing Alonso and coming forward</ACTION> Though the seas threaten, they are merciful. I have cursed them without cause.	 <ACTION>He kneels.  </ACTION> 

ALONSO  Now, all the blessings Of a glad father compass thee about! Arise, and say how thou cam’st here. <ACTION>Ferdinand stands.</ACTION> 

MIRANDA ,  <ACTION>rising and coming forward</ACTION> O wonder!	   How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is! O, brave new world That has such people in ’t! 

PROSPERO ’Tis new to thee. 

ALONSO ,  <ACTION>to Ferdinand</ACTION> What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?	 Your eld’st acquaintance cannot be three hours. Is she the goddess that hath severed us And brought us thus together? 

FERDINAND Sir, she is mortal, But by immortal providence she’s mine.	 I chose her when I could not ask my father For his advice, nor thought I had one. She Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan, Of whom so often I have heard renown, But never saw before, of whom I have	 Received a second life; and second father This lady makes him to me. 

ALONSO  I am hers. But, O, how oddly will it sound that I Must ask my child forgiveness!	 

PROSPERO There, sir, stop. Let us not burden our remembrances with A heaviness that’s gone. 

GONZALO I have inly wept Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you	 gods, And on this couple drop a blessèd crown, For it is you that have chalked forth the way Which brought us hither. 

ALONSO  I say “Amen,” Gonzalo.	 

GONZALO Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice Beyond a common joy, and set it down With gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,	 And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife Where he himself was lost; Prospero his dukedom In a poor isle; and all of us ourselves When no man was his own. 

ALONSO ,  <ACTION>to Ferdinand and Miranda</ACTION> Give me your	255 hands. Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart That doth not wish you joy! 

GONZALO Be it so. Amen. 

<ACTION>Enter Ariel, with the Master and Boatswainamazedly following.</ACTION> 

O, look, sir, look, sir, here is more of us.	 I prophesied if a gallows were on land, This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy, That swear’st grace o’erboard, not an oath on shore? Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?	 

BOATSWAIN The best news is that we have safely found Our king and company. The next: our ship, Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split, Is tight and yare and bravely rigged as when We first put out to sea.	 

ARIEL ,  <ACTION>aside to Prospero</ACTION> Sir, all this service Have I done since I went. 

PROSPERO , <ACTION> aside to Ariel</ACTION> My tricksy spirit! 

ALONSO These are not natural events. They strengthen From strange to stranger.—Say, how came you	 hither? 

BOATSWAIN If I did think, sir, I were well awake, I’d strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep And—how, we know not—all clapped under hatches,	 Where, but even now, with strange and several noises Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains, And more diversity of sounds, all horrible, We were awaked, straightway at liberty,	 Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld Our royal, good, and gallant ship, our master Cap’ring to eye her. On a trice, so please you, Even in a dream were we divided from them And were brought moping hither.	 

ARIEL ,  <ACTION>aside to Prospero </ACTION> Was ’t well done? 

PROSPERO ,  <ACTION>aside to Ariel</ACTION> Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free. 

ALONSO This is as strange a maze as e’er men trod, And there is in this business more than nature Was ever conduct of. Some oracle	 Must rectify our knowledge. 

PROSPERO Sir, my liege, Do not infest your mind with beating on The strangeness of this business. At picked leisure, Which shall be shortly, single I’ll resolve you,	 Which to you shall seem probable, of every These happened accidents; till when, be cheerful And think of each thing well.  <ACTION>Aside to Ariel.</ACTION> Come hither, spirit; Set Caliban and his companions free.	 Untie the spell.  <ACTION>Ariel exits. </ACTION> How fares my gracious sir? There are yet missing of your company Some few odd lads that you remember not. 

<ACTION>Enter Ariel, driving in Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculoin their stolen apparel.</ACTION> 

STEPHANO Every man shift for all the rest, and let no	 man take care for himself, for all is but fortune. Coraggio, bully monster, coraggio. 

TRINCULO If these be true spies which I wear in my head, here’s a goodly sight. 

CALIBAN O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed! How	 fine my master is! I am afraid he will chastise me. 

SEBASTIAN Ha, ha! What things are these, my Lord Antonio? Will money buy ’em? 

ANTONIO Very like. One of them	 Is a plain fish and no doubt marketable. 

PROSPERO Mark but the badges of these men, my lords, Then say if they be true. This misshapen knave, His mother was a witch, and one so strong That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,	 And deal in her command without her power. These three have robbed me, and this demi-devil, For he’s a bastard one, had plotted with them To take my life. Two of these fellows you Must know and own. This thing of darkness I	 Acknowledge mine. 

CALIBAN I shall be pinched to death. 

ALONSO Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler? 

SEBASTIAN He is drunk now. Where had he wine? 

ALONSO And Trinculo is reeling ripe. Where should they	 Find this grand liquor that hath gilded ’em? <ACTION>To Trinculo.</ACTION> How cam’st thou in this pickle? 

TRINCULO I have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that I fear me will never out of my bones. I shall not fear flyblowing.	 

SEBASTIAN Why, how now, Stephano? 

STEPHANO O, touch me not! I am not Stephano, but a cramp. 

PROSPERO You’d be king o’ the isle, sirrah? 

STEPHANO  I should have been a sore one, then.	 

ALONSO ,  <ACTION>indicating Caliban</ACTION> This is as strange a thing as e’er I looked on. 

PROSPERO He is as disproportioned in his manners As in his shape. To Caliban. Go, sirrah, to my cell. Take with you your companions. As you look To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.	 

CALIBAN Ay, that I will, and I’ll be wise hereafter And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass Was I to take this drunkard for a god, And worship this dull fool! 

PROSPERO Go to, away!	 

ALONSO ,  <ACTION>to Stephano and Trinculo</ACTION> Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it. 

SEBASTIAN Or stole it, rather. 

<ACTION>Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo exit.</ACTION> 

PROSPERO Sir, I invite your Highness and your train To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest For this one night, which part of it I’ll waste	 With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it Go quick away: the story of my life And the particular accidents gone by Since I came to this isle. And in the morn I’ll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,	 Where I have hope to see the nuptial Of these our dear-belovèd solemnized, And thence retire me to my Milan, where Every third thought shall be my grave. 

ALONSO I long	 To hear the story of your life, which must Take the ear strangely. 

PROSPERO  I’ll deliver all, And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales, And sail so expeditious that shall catch	 Your royal fleet far off.  <ACTION>Aside to Ariel. </ACTION> My Ariel, chick, That is thy charge. Then to the elements Be free, and fare thou well.—Please you, draw near. 

<ACTION>They all exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>spoken by Prospero.</ACTION> 

Now my charms are all o’erthrown, And what strength I have ’s mine own, Which is most faint. Now ’tis true I must be here confined by you, Or sent to Naples. Let me not,	 Since I have my dukedom got And pardoned the deceiver, dwell In this bare island by your spell, But release me from my bands With the help of your good hands.	 Gentle breath of yours my sails Must fill, or else my project fails, Which was to please. Now I want Spirits to enforce, art to enchant, And my ending is despair,	 Unless I be relieved by prayer, Which pierces so that it assaults Mercy itself, and frees all faults. As you from crimes would pardoned be, Let your indulgence set me free.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
