<ACTION>Enter the Ladies (the Princess, Rosaline,Katherine, and Maria.)</ACTION> 

PRINCESS Sweethearts, we shall be rich ere we depart, If fairings come thus plentifully in. A lady walled about with diamonds! Look you what I have from the loving king. 

<ACTION>She shows a jewel.</ACTION> 

ROSALINE Madam, came nothing else along with that?	 

PRINCESS Nothing but this? Yes, as much love in rhyme As would be crammed up in a sheet of paper Writ o’ both sides the leaf, margent and all, That he was fain to seal on Cupid’s name. 

ROSALINE That was the way to make his godhead wax,	 For he hath been five thousand year a boy. 

KATHERINE Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows, too. 

ROSALINE You’ll ne’er be friends with him. He killed your sister. 

KATHERINE He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy,	 And so she died. Had she been light like you, Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit, She might ha’ been a grandam ere she died. And so may you, for a light heart lives long. 

ROSALINE What’s your dark meaning, mouse, of this light	 word? 

KATHERINE A light condition in a beauty dark. 

ROSALINE We need more light to find your meaning out. 

KATHERINE You’ll mar the light by taking it in snuff; Therefore I’ll darkly end the argument.	 

ROSALINE Look what you do, you do it still i’ th’ dark. 

KATHERINE So do not you, for you are a light wench. 

ROSALINE Indeed, I weigh not you, and therefore light. 

KATHERINE You weigh me not? O, that’s you care not for me. 

ROSALINE Great reason: for past care is still past cure.	 

PRINCESS Well bandied both; a set of wit well played. But, Rosaline, you have a favor too. Who sent it? And what is it? 

ROSALINE I would you knew. An if my face were but as fair as yours,	 My favor were as great. Be witness this. 

<ACTION>She shows a gift.</ACTION> 

Nay, I have verses too, I thank Berowne; The numbers true; and were the numb’ring too, I were the fairest goddess on the ground. I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.	 O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter. 

PRINCESS Anything like? 

ROSALINE Much in the letters, nothing in the praise. 

PRINCESS Beauteous as ink: a good conclusion. 

KATHERINE Fair as a text B in a copybook.	 

ROSALINE Ware pencils, ho! Let me not die your debtor, My red dominical, my golden letter. O, that your face were not so full of O’s! 

PRINCESS A pox of that jest! And I beshrew all shrows. But, Katherine, what was sent to you	 From fair Dumaine? 

KATHERINE Madam, this glove.	 

<ACTION>She shows the glove.</ACTION> 

PRINCESS Did he not send you twain? 

KATHERINE Yes, madam, and moreover, Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,	 A huge translation of hypocrisy, Vilely compiled, profound simplicity. 

MARIA This, and these pearls, to me sent Longaville. 

<ACTION>She shows a paper and pearls.</ACTION> 

The letter is too long by half a mile. 

PRINCESS I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart	 The chain were longer and the letter short? 

MARIA Ay, or I would these hands might never part. 

PRINCESS We are wise girls to mock our lovers so. 

ROSALINE They are worse fools to purchase mocking so. That same Berowne I’ll torture ere I go.	 O, that I knew he were but in by th’ week, How I would make him fawn, and beg, and seek, And wait the season, and observe the times, And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes, And shape his service wholly to my hests,	 And make him proud to make me proud that jests! So pair-taunt-like would I o’ersway his state, That he should be my fool, and I his fate. 

PRINCESS None are so surely caught, when they are catched, As wit turned fool. Folly in wisdom hatched	 Hath wisdom’s warrant and the help of school, And wit’s own grace to grace a learnèd fool. 

ROSALINE The blood of youth burns not with such excess As gravity’s revolt to wantonness. 

MARIA Folly in fools bears not so strong a note	 As fool’ry in the wise, when wit doth dote, Since all the power thereof it doth apply To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity. 

<ACTION>Enter Boyet.</ACTION> 

PRINCESS Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face. 

BOYET O, I am stabbed with laughter. Where’s her Grace?	 

PRINCESS Thy news, Boyet? 

BOYET Prepare, madam, prepare. Arm, wenches, arm. Encounters mounted are Against your peace. Love doth approach, disguised, Armèd in arguments. You’ll be surprised.	 Muster your wits, stand in your own defense, Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence. 

PRINCESS Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they That charge their breath against us? Say, scout, say. 

BOYET Under the cool shade of a sycamore,	 I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour. When, lo, to interrupt my purposed rest, Toward that shade I might behold addressed The King and his companions. Warily I stole into a neighbor thicket by,	 And overheard what you shall overhear: That, by and by, disguised, they will be here. Their herald is a pretty knavish page That well by heart hath conned his embassage. Action and accent did they teach him there:	 “Thus must thou speak,” and “thus thy body bear.” And ever and anon they made a doubt Presence majestical would put him out; “For,” quoth the King, “an angel shalt thou see; Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.”	 The boy replied “An angel is not evil. I should have feared her had she been a devil.” With that, all laughed and clapped him on the shoulder, Making the bold wag by their praises bolder. One rubbed his elbow thus, and fleered, and swore A better speech was never spoke before. Another with his finger and his thumb, Cried “Via! 

We will do ’t, come what will come.” The third he capered and cried “All goes well!”	 The fourth turned on the toe, and down he fell.With that, they all did tumble on the ground With such a zealous laughter so profound That in this spleen ridiculous appears, To check their folly, passion’s solemn tears. 

PRINCESS But what, but what? Come they to visit us? 

BOYET They do, they do; and are appareled thus, Like Muscovites, or Russians, as I guess. Their purpose is to parley, to court, and dance, And every one his love-feat will advance	 Unto his several mistress—which they’ll know By favors several which they did bestow. 

PRINCESS And will they so? The gallants shall be tasked, For, ladies, we will every one be masked, And not a man of them shall have the grace,	 Despite of suit, to see a lady’s face. Hold, Rosaline, this favor thou shalt wear, And then the King will court thee for his dear. Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine. So shall Berowne take me for Rosaline.	 

<ACTION>Princess and Rosaline exchange favors.</ACTION> And change you favors too. So shall your loves Woo contrary, deceived by these removes. 

<ACTION>Katherine and Maria exchange favors.</ACTION> 

ROSALINE Come on, then, wear the favors most in sight. 

KATHERINE , <ACTION> to Princess</ACTION> 

But in this changing, what is your intent? 

PRINCESS The effect of my intent is to cross theirs.	 They do it but in mockery merriment, And mock for mock is only my intent. Their several counsels they unbosom shall To loves mistook, and so be mocked withal Upon the next occasion that we meet,	 With visages displayed, to talk and greet. 

ROSALINE But shall we dance, if they desire us to ’t? 

PRINCESS No, to the death we will not move a foot, Nor to their penned speech render we no grace, But while ’tis spoke each turn away her face.	 

BOYET Why, that contempt will kill the speaker’s heart, And quite divorce his memory from his part. 

PRINCESS Therefore I do it, and I make no doubt The rest will ne’er come in if he be out. There’s no such sport as sport by sport o’erthrown,	 To make theirs ours and ours none but our own. So shall we stay, mocking intended game, And they, well mocked, depart away with shame. 

<ACTION>Sound trumpet, within.</ACTION> 

BOYET The trumpet sounds. Be masked; the maskers come. 

<ACTION>The Ladies mask.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Blackamoors with music, the Boy with a speech,the King, Berowne, and the rest of the Lords disguised.</ACTION> 

BOY All hail, the richest beauties on the Earth!	 

BOYET Beauties no richer than rich taffeta. 

BOY A holy parcel of the fairest dames <ACTION>(The Ladies turn their backs to him.)</ACTION> That ever turned their—backs—to mortal views. 

BEROWNE Their eyes, villain, their eyes! 

BOY That ever turned their eyes to mortal views.	 Out— 

BOYET True; out indeed. 

BOY Out of your favors, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe Not to behold— 

BEROWNE Once to behold, rogue!	 

BOY Once to behold with your sun-beamèd eyes— With your sun-beamèd eyes— 

BOYET They will not answer to that epithet. You were best call it “daughter-beamèd eyes.” 

BOY They do not mark me, and that brings me out.	 

BEROWNE Is this your perfectness? Begone, you rogue! 

<ACTION>Boy exits.</ACTION> 

ROSALINE ,  <ACTION>speaking as the Princess</ACTION> What would these strangers? Know their minds, Boyet. If they do speak our language, ’tis our will That some plain man recount their purposes.	 Know what they would. 

BOYET  What would you with the Princess? 

BEROWNE Nothing but peace and gentle visitation. 

ROSALINE What would they, say they?	 

BOYET Nothing but peace and gentle visitation. 

ROSALINE Why, that they have, and bid them so be gone. 

BOYET She says you have it, and you may be gone. 

KING Say to her we have measured many miles To tread a measure with her on this grass.	 

BOYET They say that they have measured many a mile To tread a measure with you on this grass. 

ROSALINE It is not so. Ask them how many inches Is in one mile. If they have measured many, The measure then of one is eas’ly told.	 

BOYET If to come hither you have measured miles, And many miles, the Princess bids you tell How many inches doth fill up one mile. 

BEROWNE Tell her we measure them by weary steps. 

BOYET She hears herself.	 

ROSALINE How many weary steps Of many weary miles you have o’ergone Are numbered in the travel of one mile? 

BEROWNE We number nothing that we spend for you. Our duty is so rich, so infinite, That we may do it still without account. Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face That we, like savages, may worship it. 

ROSALINE My face is but a moon, and clouded too. 

KING Blessèd are clouds, to do as such clouds do!	 Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine, Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne. 

ROSALINE O vain petitioner, beg a greater matter! Thou now requests but moonshine in the water.	 

KING Then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change. Thou bidd’st me beg; this begging is not strange. 

ROSALINE Play music, then. Nay, you must do it soon. 

Music begins. 

Not yet? No dance! Thus change I like the moon. 

KING Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?	 

ROSALINE You took the moon at full, but now she’s changed. 

KING Yet still she is the moon, and I the man. The music plays. Vouchsafe some motion to it. 

ROSALINE Our ears vouchsafe it. 

KING But your legs should do it.	 

ROSALINE Since you are strangers and come here by chance, We’ll not be nice. Take hands. We will not dance. 

<ACTION>She offers her hand.</ACTION> 

KING Why take we hands then? 

ROSALINE Only to part friends.— Curtsy, sweethearts—and so the measure ends.	 

KING More measure of this measure! Be not nice. 

ROSALINE We can afford no more at such a price. 

KING Prize you yourselves. What buys your company? 

ROSALINE Your absence only. 

KING That can never be.	 

ROSALINE Then cannot we be bought. And so adieu— Twice to your visor, and half once to you. 

KING If you deny to dance, let’s hold more chat. 

ROSALINE In private, then. 

KING I am best pleased with that.	 

<ACTION>They move aside.</ACTION> 

BEROWNE , <ACTION> to the Princess</ACTION> White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee. 

PRINCESS ,  <ACTION>speaking as Rosaline</ACTION> Honey, and milk, and sugar—there is three. 

BEROWNE Nay then, two treys, an if you grow so nice, Metheglin, wort, and malmsey. Well run, dice! There’s half a dozen sweets.	 

PRINCESS Seventh sweet, adieu. Since you can cog, I’ll play no more with you. 

BEROWNE One word in secret. 

PRINCESS Let it not be sweet. 

BEROWNE Thou grievest my gall.	 

PRINCESS Gall! Bitter. 

BEROWNE Therefore meet. 

<ACTION>They move aside.</ACTION> 

DUMAINE ,  <ACTION>to Maria</ACTION> Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word? 

MARIA ,  <ACTION>speaking as Katherine</ACTION> Name it. 

DUMAINE Fair lady—	 

MARIA Say you so? Fair lord! Take that for your “fair lady.” 

DUMAINE Please it you As much in private, and I’ll bid adieu. 

<ACTION>They move aside.</ACTION> 

KATHERINE ,  <ACTION>speaking as Maria</ACTION> What, was your vizard made without a tongue?	 

LONGAVILLE I know the reason, lady, why you ask. 

KATHERINE O, for your reason! Quickly, sir, I long. 

LONGAVILLE You have a double tongue within your mask, And would afford my speechless vizard half. 

KATHERINE Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not veal a calf?	 

LONGAVILLE A calf, fair lady? 

KATHERINE No, a fair Lord Calf. 

LONGAVILLE Let’s part the word. 

KATHERINE No, I’ll not be your half. Take all and wean it. It may prove an ox.	 

LONGAVILLE Look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks. Will you give horns, chaste lady? Do not so. 

KATHERINE Then die a calf before your horns do grow. 

LONGAVILLE One word in private with you ere I die. 

KATHERINE Bleat softly, then. The butcher hears you cry.	 

<ACTION>They move aside.</ACTION> 

BOYET The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen As is the razor’s edge invisible, Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen; Above the sense of sense, so sensible Seemeth their conference. Their conceits have	 wings Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things. 

ROSALINE Not one word more, my maids. Break off, break off! 

<ACTION>The Ladies move away from the Lords.</ACTION> 

BEROWNE By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!	 

KING Farewell, mad wenches. You have simple wits. 

<ACTION>King, Lords, and Blackamoors exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>The Ladies unmask.</ACTION> 

PRINCESS Twenty adieus, my frozen Muskovits.— Are these the breed of wits so wondered at? 

BOYET Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puffed out.	 

ROSALINE Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat. 

PRINCESS O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout! Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight? Or ever but in vizards show their faces? This pert Berowne was out of count’nance quite.	 

ROSALINE They were all in lamentable cases. The King was weeping ripe for a good word. 

PRINCESS Berowne did swear himself out of all suit. 

MARIA Dumaine was at my service, and his sword. “No point,” quoth I. My servant straight was	 mute. 

KATHERINE Lord Longaville said I came o’er his heart. And trow you what he called me? 

PRINCESS Qualm, perhaps. 

KATHERINE Yes, in good faith.	 

PRINCESS Go, sickness as thou art! 

ROSALINE Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps. But will you hear? The King is my love sworn. 

PRINCESS And quick Berowne hath plighted faith to me. 

KATHERINE And Longaville was for my service born.	 

MARIA Dumaine is mine as sure as bark on tree. 

BOYET Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear. Immediately they will again be here In their own shapes, for it can never be They will digest this harsh indignity.	 

PRINCESS Will they return? 

BOYET They will, they will, God knows, And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows. Therefore change favors, and when they repair, Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.	 

PRINCESS How “blow”? How “blow”? Speak to be understood. 

BOYET Fair ladies masked are roses in their bud. Dismasked, their damask sweet commixture shown, Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown. 

PRINCESS Avaunt, perplexity!—What shall we do	 If they return in their own shapes to woo? 

ROSALINE Good madam, if by me you’ll be advised, Let’s mock them still, as well known as disguised. Let us complain to them what fools were here, Disguised like Muscovites in shapeless gear,	 And wonder what they were, and to what end Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penned, And their rough carriage so ridiculous, Should be presented at our tent to us. 

BOYET Ladies, withdraw. The gallants are at hand.	 

PRINCESS Whip to our tents, as roes runs o’er land. 

<ACTION>The Princess and the Ladies exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter the King and the rest, as themselves.</ACTION> 

KING ,  <ACTION>to Boyet</ACTION> Fair sir, God save you. Where’s the Princess? 

BOYET Gone to her tent. Please it your Majesty Command me any service to her thither? 

KING That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.	 

BOYET I will, and so will she, I know, my lord.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

BEROWNE This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons peas, And utters it again when God doth please. He is wit’s peddler, and retails his wares At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs.	 And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know, Have not the grace to grace it with such show. This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve. Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve. He can carve too, and lisp. Why, this is he	 That kissed his hand away in courtesy. This is the ape of form, Monsieur the Nice, That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice In honorable terms. Nay, he can sing A mean most meanly; and in ushering	 Mend him who can. The ladies call him sweet. The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet. This is the flower that smiles on everyone To show his teeth as white as whale’s bone; And consciences that will not die in debt	 Pay him the due of “honey-tongued Boyet.” 

KING A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart, That put Armado’s page out of his part! 

<ACTION>Enter the Ladies, with Boyet.</ACTION> 

BEROWNE See where it comes! Behavior, what wert thou Till this madman showed thee? And what art thou	 now? 

KING ,  <ACTION>to Princess</ACTION> All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day. 

PRINCESS “Fair” in “all hail” is foul, as I conceive. 

KING Construe my speeches better, if you may. 

PRINCESS Then wish me better. I will give you leave.	 

KING We came to visit you, and purpose now To lead you to our court. Vouchsafe it, then. 

PRINCESS This field shall hold me, and so hold your vow. Nor God nor I delights in perjured men. 

KING Rebuke me not for that which you provoke.	 The virtue of your eye must break my oath. 

PRINCESS You nickname virtue; “vice” you should have spoke, For virtue’s office never breaks men’s troth. Now by my maiden honor, yet as pure As the unsullied lily, I protest,	 A world of torments though I should endure, I would not yield to be your house’s guest, So much I hate a breaking cause to be Of heavenly oaths vowed with integrity. 

KING O, you have lived in desolation here,	 Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame. 

PRINCESS Not so, my lord. It is not so, I swear. We have had pastimes here and pleasant game. A mess of Russians left us but of late. 

KING How, madam? Russians?	 

PRINCESS Ay, in truth, my lord. Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state. 

ROSALINE Madam, speak true.—It is not so, my lord. My lady, to the manner of the days, In courtesy gives undeserving praise.	 We four indeed confronted were with four In Russian habit. Here they stayed an hour And talked apace; and in that hour, my lord, They did not bless us with one happy word. I dare not call them fools; but this I think:	 When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink. 

BEROWNE This jest is dry to me. Gentle sweet, Your wits makes wise things foolish. When we greet, With eyes’ best seeing, heaven’s fiery eye, By light we lose light. Your capacity	 Is of that nature that to your huge store Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor. 

ROSALINE This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye— 

BEROWNE I am a fool, and full of poverty. 

ROSALINE But that you take what doth to you belong,	 It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue. 

BEROWNE O, I am yours, and all that I possess! 

ROSALINE All the fool mine? 

BEROWNE I cannot give you less. 

ROSALINE Which of the vizards was it that you wore?	 

BEROWNE Where? When? What vizard? Why demand you this? 

ROSALINE There; then; that vizard; that superfluous case That hid the worse and showed the better face. 

KING ,  <ACTION>aside to Dumaine</ACTION> We were descried. They’ll mock us now downright. 

DUMAINE ,  <ACTION>aside to King</ACTION> Let us confess and turn it to a jest.	 

PRINCESS ,  <ACTION>to King</ACTION> Amazed, my lord? Why looks your Highness sad? 

ROSALINE Help, hold his brows! He’ll swoon!—Why look you pale? Seasick, I think, coming from Muscovy. 

BEROWNE Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.	 Can any face of brass hold longer out? Here stand I, lady. Dart thy skill at me. Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout. Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance. Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit,	 And I will wish thee nevermore to dance, Nor nevermore in Russian habit wait. O, never will I trust to speeches penned, Nor to the motion of a schoolboy’s tongue, Nor never come in vizard to my friend,	 Nor woo in rhyme like a blind harper’s song. Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise, Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation, Figures pedantical—these summer flies Have blown me full of maggot ostentation.	445 I do forswear them, and I here protest By this white glove—how white the hand, God knows!— Henceforth my wooing mind shall be expressed In russet yeas and honest kersey noes.	 And to begin: Wench, so God help me, law, My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw. 

ROSALINE Sans “sans,” I pray you. 

BEROWNE  Yet I have a trick Of the old rage. Bear with me, I am sick;	 I’ll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see: Write “Lord have mercy on us” on those three. They are infected; in their hearts it lies. They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes. These lords are visited. You are not free,	 For the Lord’s tokens on you do I see. 

PRINCESS No, they are free that gave these tokens to us. 

BEROWNE Our states are forfeit. Seek not to undo us. 

ROSALINE It is not so, for how can this be true, That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?	 

BEROWNE Peace, for I will not have to do with you. 

ROSALINE Nor shall not, if I do as I intend. 

BEROWNE ,  <ACTION>to King, Longaville, and Dumaine</ACTION> Speak for yourselves. My wit is at an end. 

KING , <ACTION> to Princess</ACTION> Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression Some fair excuse.	 

PRINCESS The fairest is confession. Were not you here but even now, disguised? 

KING Madam, I was. 

PRINCESS  And were you well advised? 

KING I was, fair madam.	 

PRINCESS When you then were here, What did you whisper in your lady’s ear? 

KING That more than all the world I did respect her. 

PRINCESS When she shall challenge this, you will reject her. 

KING Upon mine honor, no.	 

PRINCESS Peace, peace, forbear! Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear. 

KING Despise me when I break this oath of mine. 

PRINCESS I will, and therefore keep it.—Rosaline, What did the Russian whisper in your ear?	 

ROSALINE Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear As precious eyesight, and did value me Above this world, adding thereto moreover That he would wed me or else die my lover. 

PRINCESS God give thee joy of him! The noble lord	 Most honorably doth uphold his word. 

KING What mean you, madam? By my life, my troth, I never swore this lady such an oath. 

ROSALINE By heaven, you did! And to confirm it plain, You gave me this.  <ACTION>She shows a token.</ACTION> But take it,	 sir, again. 

KING My faith and this the Princess I did give. I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve. 

PRINCESS Pardon me, sir. This jewel did she wear. <ACTION>She points to Rosaline.</ACTION> And Lord Berowne, I thank him, is my dear.	 <ACTION>To Berowne.</ACTION> What, will you have me, or your pearl again?	She shows the token. 

BEROWNE Neither of either. I remit both twain. I see the trick on ’t. Here was a consent, Knowing aforehand of our merriment,	 To dash it like a Christmas comedy. Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany, Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,	 That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick To make my lady laugh when she’s disposed, Told our intents before; which once disclosed, The ladies did change favors; and then we, Following the signs, wooed but the sign of she.	 Now, to our perjury to add more terror, We are again forsworn in will and error. Much upon this ’tis.  <ACTION>To Boyet. </ACTION> And might not you Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue? Do not you know my lady’s foot by th’ squier?	 And laugh upon the apple of her eye? And stand between her back, sir, and the fire, Holding a trencher, jesting merrily? You put our page out. Go, you are allowed. Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.	 You leer upon me, do you? There’s an eye Wounds like a leaden sword. 

BOYET Full merrily Hath this brave manage, this career been run. 

BEROWNE Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace, I have done.	 

<ACTION>Enter Clown Costard.</ACTION> 

Welcome, pure wit. Thou part’st a fair fray. 

COSTARD O Lord, sir, they would know Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no. 

BEROWNE What, are there but three? 

COSTARD No, sir; but it is vara fine,	 For every one pursents three. 

BEROWNE  And three times thrice is nine. 

COSTARD Not so, sir, under correction, sir, I hope it is not so. You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir; we	 know what we know. I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir— 

BEROWNE Is not nine? 

COSTARD Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.	 

BEROWNE By Jove, I always took three threes for nine. 

COSTARD O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living by reckoning, sir. 

BEROWNE How much is it? 

COSTARD O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors,	 sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount. For mine own part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one man in one poor man—Pompion the Great, sir. 

BEROWNE Art thou one of the Worthies? 

COSTARD It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompey	 the Great. For mine own part, I know not the degree of the Worthy, but I am to stand for him. 

BEROWNE Go bid them prepare. 

COSTARD We will turn it finely off, sir. We will take some care.   

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

KING Berowne, they will shame us. Let them not approach. 

BEROWNE We are shame-proof, my lord; and ’tis some policy To have one show worse than the King’s and his company.	 

KING I say they shall not come. 

PRINCESS Nay, my good lord, let me o’errule you now. That sport best pleases that doth least know how, Where zeal strives to content, and the contents Dies in the zeal of that which it presents.	 Their form confounded makes most form in mirth, When great things laboring perish in their birth. 

BEROWNE A right description of our sport, my lord. 

<ACTION>Enter Braggart Armado.</ACTION> 

ARMADO ,  <ACTION>to King  Anointed</ACTION> ,  I implore so much expense of thy royal sweet breath as will utter a brace	 of words.	 

<ACTION>Armado and King step aside, andArmado gives King a paper.</ACTION> 

PRINCESS Doth this man serve God? 

BEROWNE Why ask you? 

PRINCESS He speaks not like a man of God his making. 

ARMADO , <ACTION> to King</ACTION> That is all one, my fair sweet honey	 monarch, for, I protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding fantastical, too, too vain, too, too vain. But we will put it, as they say, to fortuna de la guerra.—I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement!	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

KING , <ACTION> reading the paper</ACTION> Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies. He presents Hector of Troy, the swain Pompey the Great, the parish curate Alexander, Armado’s page Hercules, the pedant Judas Maccabaeus. And if these four Worthies in their first show thrive, These four will change habits and present the other five. 

BEROWNE There is five in the first show. 

KING You are deceived. ’Tis not so. 

BEROWNE The pedant, the braggart, the hedge priest, the fool, and the boy. Abate throw at novum, and the whole world again Cannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein. 

KING The ship is under sail, and here she comes amain.	 

<ACTION>Enter Costard as Pompey.</ACTION> 

COSTARD I Pompey am— 

BEROWNE You lie; you are not he. 

COSTARD I Pompey am— 

BOYET With leopard’s head on knee. 

BEROWNE Well said, old mocker. I must needs be friends with	 thee. 

COSTARD I Pompey am, Pompey, surnamed the Big— 

DUMAINE “The Great.” 

COSTARD It is “Great,” sir.—Pompey, surnamed the Great,	 That oft in field, with targe and shield, did make my foe to sweat. And traveling along this coast, I here am come by chance, And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of	 France. <ACTION>(He places his weapons at the feet of the Princess.)</ACTION> If your Ladyship would say “Thanks, Pompey,” I had done. 

PRINCESS  Great thanks, great Pompey. 

COSTARD ’Tis not so much worth, but I hope I was	 perfect. I made a little fault in “Great.” 

BEROWNE My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.	 

<ACTION>Costard stands aside.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Curate Nathaniel for Alexander.</ACTION> 

NATHANIEL When in the world I lived, I was the world’s commander.	 By east, west, north, and south, I spread my conquering might. My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander— 

BOYET Your nose says no, you are not, for it stands too right.	 

BEROWNE , <ACTION> to Boyet</ACTION> Your nose smells “no” in this, most tender-smelling knight. 

PRINCESS The conqueror is dismayed.—Proceed, good Alexander. 

NATHANIEL When in the world I lived, I was the world’s	 commander— 

BOYET Most true; ’tis right. You were so, Alisander. 

BEROWNE ,  <ACTION>to Costard</ACTION> Pompey the Great— 

COSTARD Your servant, and Costard. 

BEROWNE  Take away the conqueror. Take away	 Alisander. 

COSTARD , <ACTION> to Nathaniel</ACTION> O sir, you have overthrown Alisander the Conqueror. You will be scraped out of the painted cloth for this. Your lion, that holds his polax sitting on a close-stool, will be given to Ajax.	 He will be the ninth Worthy. A conqueror, and afeard to speak? Run away for shame, Alisander. 

<ACTION>Nathaniel exits.</ACTION> 

There, an ’t shall please you, a foolish mild man, an honest man, look you, and soon dashed. He is a marvelous good neighbor, faith, and a very good	 bowler. But, for Alisander—alas, you see how ’tis— a little o’erparted. But there are Worthies a-coming will speak their mind in some other sort. 

<ACTION>Enter Pedant Holofernes for Judas, and the Boyfor Hercules.</ACTION> 

PRINCESS ,  <ACTION>to Costard</ACTION> Stand aside, good Pompey. 

HOLOFERNES Great Hercules is presented by this imp,	 Whose club killed Cerberus, that three-headed canus, And when he was a babe, a child, a shrimp, Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus. Quoniam he seemeth in minority, Ergo I come with this apology.	 <ACTION>To Boy. </ACTION> Keep some state in thy exit, and vanish. 

<ACTION>Boy steps aside.</ACTION> 

HOLOFERNES Judas I am— 

DUMAINE A Judas! 

HOLOFERNES Not Iscariot, sir. Judas I am, yclept Maccabaeus.	 

DUMAINE Judas Maccabaeus clipped is plain Judas. 

BEROWNE A kissing traitor.—How art thou proved Judas? 

HOLOFERNES Judas I am— 

DUMAINE  The more shame for you, Judas.	 

HOLOFERNES What mean you, sir? 

BOYET To make Judas hang himself. 

HOLOFERNES Begin, sir, you are my elder. 

BEROWNE  Well followed. Judas was hanged on an elder.	 

HOLOFERNES  I will not be put out of countenance. 

BEROWNE Because thou hast no face. 

HOLOFERNES What is this?	 

<ACTION>He points to his own face.</ACTION> 

BOYET A cittern-head. 

DUMAINE The head of a bodkin.	 

BEROWNE  A death’s face in a ring. 

LONGAVILLE The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen. 

BOYET The pommel of Caesar’s falchion. 

DUMAINE  The carved-bone face on a flask.	 

BEROWNE Saint George’s half-cheek in a brooch. 

DUMAINE Ay, and in a brooch of lead. 

BEROWNE Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer. And now forward, for we have put thee in countenance.	 

HOLOFERNES  You have put me out of countenance. 

BEROWNE False. We have given thee faces. 

HOLOFERNES But you have outfaced them all. 

BEROWNE An thou wert a lion, we would do so. 

BOYET Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.—	 And so adieu, sweet Jude. Nay, why dost thou stay? 

DUMAINE For the latter end of his name. 

BEROWNE For the “ass” to the “Jude”? Give it him.—Jud-as, away! 

HOLOFERNES This is not generous, not gentle, not humble.	 

BOYET A light for Monsieur Judas! It grows dark; he may stumble.	 

<ACTION>Holofernes exits.</ACTION> 

PRINCESS Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited! 

<ACTION>Enter Braggart Armado as Hector.</ACTION> 

BEROWNE Hide thy head, Achilles. Here comes Hector in arms.	 

DUMAINE Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry. 

KING  Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this. 

BOYET  But is this Hector? 

KING I think Hector was not so clean-timbered.	 

LONGAVILLE His leg is too big for Hector’s. 

DUMAINE More calf, certain. 

BOYET No, he is best endued in the small. 

BEROWNE  This cannot be Hector. 

DUMAINE  He’s a god or a painter, for he makes faces.	 

ARMADO The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty, Gave Hector a gift— 

DUMAINE A gilt nutmeg. 

BEROWNE A lemon. 

LONGAVILLE Stuck with cloves.	 

DUMAINE No, cloven. 

ARMADO Peace! The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty, Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion, A man so breathed, that certain he would fight, yea,	 From morn till night, out of his pavilion. I am that flower— 

DUMAINE That mint. 

LONGAVILLE That columbine. 

ARMADO  Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.	 

LONGAVILLE  I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against Hector. 

DUMAINE Ay, and Hector’s a greyhound. 

ARMADO  The sweet warman is dead and rotten. Sweet chucks, beat not the bones of the buried. When he	 breathed, he was a man. But I will forward with my device. To Princess. Sweet royalty, bestow on me the sense of hearing. 

<ACTION>Berowne steps forth.</ACTION> 

PRINCESS Speak, brave Hector. We are much delighted. 

ARMADO I do adore thy sweet Grace’s slipper.	 

BOYET Loves her by the foot. 

DUMAINE He may not by the yard. 

ARMADO This Hector far surmounted Hannibal. The party is gone— 

COSTARD Fellow Hector, she is gone; she is two	 months on her way. 

ARMADO What meanest thou? 

COSTARD Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor wench is cast away. She’s quick; the child brags in her belly already. ’Tis yours.	 

ARMADO Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? Thou shalt die! 

COSTARD Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta, that is quick by him, and hanged for Pompey, that is dead by him.	 

DUMAINE Most rare Pompey! 

BOYET Renowned Pompey! 

BEROWNE Greater than “Great”! Great, great, great Pompey. Pompey the Huge! 

DUMAINE Hector trembles.	 

BEROWNE Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! Stir them on, stir them on. 

DUMAINE Hector will challenge him. 

BEROWNE Ay, if he have no more man’s blood in his belly than will sup a flea.	 

ARMADO ,  <ACTION>to Costard</ACTION> By the North Pole, I do challenge thee! 

COSTARD I will not fight with a pole like a northern man! I’ll slash. I’ll do it by the sword.—I bepray you, let me borrow my arms again.	 

DUMAINE Room for the incensed Worthies! 

COSTARD I’ll do it in my shirt.	 

<ACTION>He removes his doublet.</ACTION> 

DUMAINE Most resolute Pompey! 

BOY , <ACTION> to Armado</ACTION> Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you not see Pompey is uncasing for the	 combat? What mean you? You will lose your reputation. 

ARMADO Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me. I will not combat in my shirt. 

DUMAINE You may not deny it. Pompey hath made the	 challenge. 

ARMADO Sweet bloods, I both may and will. 

BEROWNE What reason have you for ’t? 

ARMADO  The naked truth of it is, I have no shirt. I go woolward for penance.	 

BOYET True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of linen; since when, I’ll be sworn, he wore none but a dishclout of Jaquenetta’s, and that he wears next his heart for a favor. 

<ACTION>Enter a Messenger, Monsieur Marcade.</ACTION> 

MARCADE ,  <ACTION>to Princess </ACTION> God save you, madam.	 

PRINCESS Welcome, Marcade, But that thou interruptest our merriment. 

MARCADE I am sorry, madam, for the news I bring Is heavy in my tongue. The King your father— 

PRINCESS Dead, for my life.	 

MARCADE Even so. My tale is told. 

BEROWNE Worthies, away! The scene begins to cloud. 

ARMADO For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have seen the day of wrong through the little hole of discretion, and I will right myself like a soldier.	 

<ACTION>Worthies exit.</ACTION> 

KING ,  <ACTION>to Princess</ACTION> How fares your Majesty? 

PRINCESS Boyet, prepare. I will away tonight. 

KING Madam, not so. I do beseech you stay. 

PRINCESS ,  <ACTION>to Boyet</ACTION> Prepare, I say.—I thank you, gracious lords, For all your fair endeavors, and entreat,	 Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide The liberal opposition of our spirits, If overboldly we have borne ourselves In the converse of breath; your gentleness	 Was guilty of it. Farewell, worthy lord. A heavy heart bears not a humble tongue. Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks For my great suit so easily obtained. 

KING The extreme parts of time extremely forms	 All causes to the purpose of his speed, And often at his very loose decides That which long process could not arbitrate. And though the mourning brow of progeny Forbid the smiling courtesy of love	 The holy suit which fain it would convince, Yet since love’s argument was first on foot, Let not the cloud of sorrow jostle it From what it purposed, since to wail friends lost Is not by much so wholesome-profitable	 As to rejoice at friends but newly found. 

PRINCESS I understand you not. My griefs are double. 

BEROWNE Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief, And by these badges understand the King: For your fair sakes have we neglected time,	 Played foul play with our oaths. Your beauty, ladies, Hath much deformed us, fashioning our humors Even to the opposèd end of our intents. And what in us hath seemed ridiculous— As love is full of unbefitting strains,	 All wanton as a child, skipping and vain, Formed by the eye and therefore, like the eye, Full of strange shapes, of habits, and of forms, Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll To every varied object in his glance;	 Which parti-coated presence of loose love Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes, Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities, Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults, Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,	 Our love being yours, the error that love makes Is likewise yours. We to ourselves prove false By being once false forever to be true To those that make us both—fair ladies, you. And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,	 Thus purifies itself and turns to grace. 

PRINCESS We have received your letters full of love; Your favors, the ambassadors of love; And in our maiden council rated them At courtship, pleasant jest, and courtesy,	 As bombast and as lining to the time. But more devout than this in our respects Have we not been, and therefore met your loves In their own fashion, like a merriment. 

DUMAINE Our letters, madam, showed much more than jest.	 

LONGAVILLE So did our looks. 

ROSALINE We did not quote them so. 

KING Now, at the latest minute of the hour, Grant us your loves. 

PRINCESS A time, methinks, too short	 To make a world-without-end bargain in. No, no, my lord, your Grace is perjured much, Full of dear guiltiness, and therefore this: If for my love—as there is no such cause— You will do aught, this shall you do for me:	 Your oath I will not trust, but go with speed To some forlorn and naked hermitage, Remote from all the pleasures of the world. There stay until the twelve celestial signs Have brought about the annual reckoning.	 If this austere insociable life Change not your offer made in heat of blood; If frosts and fasts, hard lodging, and thin weeds Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love, But that it bear this trial, and last love;	 Then, at the expiration of the year, Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts, 

<ACTION>She takes his hand.</ACTION> 

And by this virgin palm now kissing thine, I will be thine. And till that instant shut My woeful self up in a mourning house,	 Raining the tears of lamentation For the remembrance of my father’s death. If this thou do deny, let our hands part, Neither entitled in the other’s heart. 

KING If this, or more than this, I would deny,	 To flatter up these powers of mine with rest, The sudden hand of death close up mine eye! Hence hermit, then. My heart is in thy breast. 

<ACTION>They step aside.</ACTION> 

DUMAINE ,  <ACTION>to Katherine</ACTION> But what to me, my love? But what to me? A wife?	 

KATHERINE A beard, fair health, and honesty. With threefold love I wish you all these three. 

DUMAINE O, shall I say “I thank you, gentle wife”? 

KATHERINE Not so, my lord. A twelvemonth and a day I’ll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say.	 Come when the King doth to my lady come; Then, if I have much love, I’ll give you some. 

DUMAINE I’ll serve thee true and faithfully till then. 

KATHERINE Yet swear not, lest you be forsworn again. 

<ACTION>They step aside.</ACTION> 

LONGAVILLE What says Maria?	 

MARIA At the twelvemonth’s end I’ll change my black gown for a faithful friend. 

LONGAVILLE I’ll stay with patience, but the time is long. 

MARIA The liker you; few taller are so young. 

<ACTION>They step aside.</ACTION> 

BEROWNE ,  <ACTION>to Rosaline</ACTION> Studies my lady? Mistress, look on me.	 Behold the window of my heart, mine eye, What humble suit attends thy answer there. Impose some service on me for thy love. 

ROSALINE Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Berowne, Before I saw you; and the world’s large tongue	 Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks, Full of comparisons and wounding flouts, Which you on all estates will execute That lie within the mercy of your wit. To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,	 And therewithal to win me, if you please, Without the which I am not to be won, You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day Visit the speechless sick, and still converse With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,	 With all the fierce endeavor of your wit, To enforce the painèd impotent to smile. 

BEROWNE To move wild laughter in the throat of death? It cannot be, it is impossible. Mirth cannot move a soul in agony. 

ROSALINE Why, that’s the way to choke a gibing spirit, Whose influence is begot of that loose grace Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools. A jest’s prosperity lies in the ear Of him that hears it, never in the tongue	 Of him that makes it. Then if sickly ears, Deafed with the clamors of their own dear groans Will hear your idle scorns, continue then, And I will have you and that fault withal. But if they will not, throw away that spirit,	 And I shall find you empty of that fault, Right joyful of your reformation. 

BEROWNE A twelvemonth? Well, befall what will befall, I’ll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital. 

PRINCESS ,  <ACTION>to King</ACTION> Ay, sweet my lord, and so I take my leave.	 

KING No, madam, we will bring you on your way. 

BEROWNE Our wooing doth not end like an old play. Jack hath not Jill. These ladies’ courtesy Might well have made our sport a comedy. 

KING Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,	 And then ’twill end. 

BEROWNE That’s too long for a play. 

<ACTION>Enter Braggart Armado.</ACTION> 

ARMADO Sweet Majesty, vouchsafe me— 

PRINCESS Was not that Hector? 

DUMAINE The worthy knight of Troy.	 

ARMADO I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am a votary; I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the plow for her sweet love three year. But, most esteemed Greatness, will you hear the dialogue that the two learned men have compiled in praise of the	 owl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in the end of our show. 

KING Call them forth quickly. We will do so. 

ARMADO Holla! Approach. 

<ACTION>Enter all.</ACTION> 

This side is Hiems, Winter; this Ver, the Spring; the	 one maintained by the owl, th’ other by the cuckoo. Ver, begin. 

<ACTION>The Song.</ACTION> 

SPRING When daisies pied and violets blue, And lady-smocks all silver-white, And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue	 Do paint the meadows with delight, The cuckoo then on every tree Mocks married men; for thus sings he: “Cuckoo! Cuckoo, cuckoo!” O word of fear,	 Unpleasing to a married ear. 

When shepherds pipe on oaten straws, And merry larks are plowmen’s clocks; When turtles tread, and rooks and daws, And maidens bleach their summer smocks;	 The cuckoo then on every tree Mocks married men, for thus sings he: “Cuckoo! Cuckoo, cuckoo!” O word of fear, Unpleasing to a married ear.	 

WINTER When icicles hang by the wall, And Dick the shepherd blows his nail, And Tom bears logs into the hall, And milk comes frozen home in pail; When blood is nipped, and ways be foul,	 Then nightly sings the staring owl “Tu-whit to-who.” A merry note, While greasy Joan doth keel the pot. 

When all aloud the wind doth blow, And coughing drowns the parson’s saw,	 And birds sit brooding in the snow, And Marian’s nose looks red and raw; When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl, Then nightly sings the staring owl “Tu-whit to-who.” A merry note,	 While greasy Joan doth keel the pot. 

ARMADO The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of Apollo. You that way; we this way. 

<ACTION>They all exit.</ACTION>
