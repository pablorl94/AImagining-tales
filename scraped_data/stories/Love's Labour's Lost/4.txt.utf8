<ACTION>Enter the Princess, a Forester, her Ladies, Boyet andher other Lords.</ACTION> 

PRINCESS Was that the King that spurred his horse so hard Against the steep uprising of the hill? 

FORESTER I know not, but I think it was not he. 

PRINCESS Whoe’er he was, he showed a mounting mind.— Well, lords, today we shall have our dispatch.	 Or Saturday we will return to France.— Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush That we must stand and play the murderer in? 

FORESTER Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice, A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.	 

PRINCESS I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot, And thereupon thou speakst “the fairest shoot.” 

FORESTER Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so. 

PRINCESS What, what? First praise me, and again say no? O short-lived pride. Not fair? Alack, for woe!	 

FORESTER Yes, madam, fair. 

PRINCESS Nay, never paint me now. Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow. Here, good my glass, take this for telling true. 

<ACTION>She gives him money.</ACTION> 

Fair payment for foul words is more than due.	 

FORESTER Nothing but fair is that which you inherit. 

PRINCESS See, see, my beauty will be saved by merit. O heresy in fair, fit for these days! A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise. But come, the bow.  <ACTION>He hands her a bow.</ACTION> Now	 mercy goes to kill, And shooting well is then accounted ill. Thus will I save my credit in the shoot: Not wounding, pity would not let me do ’t; If wounding, then it was to show my skill,	 That more for praise than purpose meant to kill. And out of question so it is sometimes: Glory grows guilty of detested crimes, When for fame’s sake, for praise, an outward part, We bend to that the working of the heart;	 As I for praise alone now seek to spill The poor deer’s blood, that my heart means no ill. 

BOYET Do not curst wives hold that self sovereignty Only for praise’ sake when they strive to be Lords o’er their lords?	 

PRINCESS Only for praise; and praise we may afford To any lady that subdues a lord. 

<ACTION>Enter Clown Costard.</ACTION> 

BOYET Here comes a member of the commonwealth. 

COSTARD God dig-you-den all! Pray you, which is the head lady?	 

PRINCESS Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that have no heads. 

COSTARD Which is the greatest lady, the highest? 

PRINCESS The thickest and the tallest. 

COSTARD The thickest and the tallest: it is so, truth is	 truth. An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit, One o’ these maids’ girdles for your waist should be fit. Are not you the chief woman? You are the thickest	 here. 

PRINCESS What’s your will, sir? What’s your will? 

COSTARD I have a letter from Monsieur Berowne to one Lady Rosaline. 

PRINCESS O, thy letter, thy letter! He’s a good friend of mine.	 Stand aside, good bearer.—Boyet, you can carve. Break up this capon. 

BOYET ,  <ACTION>taking the letter</ACTION> I am bound to serve. This letter is mistook; it importeth none here. It is writ to Jaquenetta.	 

PRINCESS We will read it, I swear. Break the neck of the wax, and everyone give ear. 

BOYET <ACTION>reads.</ACTION> "By heaven, that thou art fair is most infallible, true that thou art beauteous, truth itself that thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful	 than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have commiseration on thy heroical vassal. The magnanimous and most illustrate King Cophetua set eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar Zenelophon; and he it was that might rightly say 'Veni, vidi, vici,' which to	 annothanize in the vulgar (O base and obscure vulgar!) videlicet, 'He came, see, and overcame': He came, one; see, two; overcame, three. Who came? The King. Why did he come? To see. Why did he see? To overcome. To whom came he? To the beggar. What	 saw he? The beggar. Who overcame he? The beggar. The conclusion is victory. On whose side? The King’s. The captive is enriched. On whose side? The beggar’s. The catastrophe is a nuptial. On whose side? The King’s—no, on both in one, or one in both. I am	 the King, for so stands the comparison; thou the beggar, for so witnesseth thy lowliness. Shall I command thy love? 

I may.Shall I enforce thy love? I could. Shall I entreat thy love? I will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? Robes. For tittles? Titles. For thyself? Me. Thus expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot, my eyes on thy picture, and my heart on thy every part. Thine, in the dearest design of industry, Don Adriano de Armado. Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar ’Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey. Submissive fall his princely feet before, And he from forage will incline to play. But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then? Food for his rage, repasture for his den." 

PRINCESS What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter? What vane? What weathercock? Did you ever hear better? 

BOYET I am much deceived but I remember the style.	 

PRINCESS Else your memory is bad, going o’er it erewhile. 

BOYET This Armado is a Spaniard that keeps here in court, A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport To the Prince and his bookmates.	 

PRINCESS , <ACTION> to Costard</ACTION> Thou, fellow, a word. Who gave thee this letter? 

COSTARD  I told you: my lord. 

PRINCESS To whom shouldst thou give it? 

COSTARD From my lord to my	 lady. 

PRINCESS From which lord to which lady? 

COSTARD From my Lord Berowne, a good master of mine, To a lady of France that he called Rosaline. 

PRINCESS Thou hast mistaken his letter. Come, lords, away.	 <ACTION>To Rosaline.</ACTION> Here, sweet, put up this; ’twill be thine another day. 

<ACTION>The Princess, Katherine, Lords, andForester exit. Boyet, Rosaline, Maria,and Costard remain.</ACTION> 

BOYET Who is the shooter? Who is the shooter? 

ROSALINE Shall I teach you to know?	 

BOYET Ay, my continent of beauty. 

ROSALINE Why, she that bears the bow. Finely put off. 

BOYET My lady goes to kill horns, but if thou marry, Hang me by the neck if horns that year miscarry.	 Finely put on. 

ROSALINE Well, then, I am the shooter. 

BOYET And who is your deer? 

ROSALINE If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near. Finely put on, indeed.	 

MARIA You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes at the brow. 

BOYET But she herself is hit lower. Have I hit her now? 

ROSALINE Shall I come upon thee with an old saying, that was a man when King Pippen of France was a	 little boy, as touching the hit it? 

BOYET So I may answer thee with one as old, that was a woman when Queen Guinover of Britain was a little wench, as touching the hit it. 

ROSALINE <ACTION>sings</ACTION> Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it,	 Thou canst not hit it, my good man. 

BOYET <ACTION>sings</ACTION> An I cannot, cannot, cannot, An I cannot, another can. 

<ACTION>Rosaline exits.</ACTION> 

COSTARD By my troth, most pleasant. How both did fit it! 

MARIA A mark marvelous well shot, for they both did hit	 it. 

BOYET A mark! O, mark but that mark. “A mark,” says my lady. Let the mark have a prick in ’t to mete at, if it may be.		 

MARIA Wide o’ the bow hand! I’ faith, your hand is out. 

COSTARD Indeed, he must shoot nearer, or he’ll ne’er hit the clout. 

BOYET ,  <ACTION>to Maria</ACTION> An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in. 

COSTARD Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin.	 

MARIA Come, come, you talk greasily. Your lips grow foul. 

COSTARD ,  <ACTION>to Boyet</ACTION> She’s too hard for you at pricks, sir. Challenge her to bowl. 

BOYET I fear too much rubbing. Good night, my good owl. 

<ACTION>Boyet and Maria exit.</ACTION> 

COSTARD By my soul, a swain, a most simple clown.	 Lord, Lord, how the ladies and I have put him down. O’ my troth, most sweet jests, most incony vulgar wit, When it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely, as it	 were, so fit. Armado o’ th’ one side, O, a most dainty man! To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan. To see him kiss his hand, and how most sweetly he will swear.	 And his page o’ t’ other side, that handful of wit! Ah heavens, it is a most pathetical nit. 

<ACTION>Shout within.</ACTION> 

Sola, sola! 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
