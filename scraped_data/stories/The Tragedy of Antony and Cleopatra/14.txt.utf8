<ACTION>Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, and Alexas.</ACTION> 

CLEOPATRA Where is the fellow? 

ALEXAS Half afeard to come. 

CLEOPATRA Go to, go to.—Come hither, sir. 

<ACTION>Enter the Messenger as before.</ACTION> 

ALEXAS Good Majesty, Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you	 But when you are well pleased. 

CLEOPATRA That Herod’s head I’ll have! But how, when Antony is gone, Through whom I might command it?—Come thou near.	 

MESSENGER Most gracious Majesty! 

CLEOPATRA  Did’st thou behold Octavia? 

MESSENGER Ay, dread queen. 

CLEOPATRA Where? 

MESSENGER Madam, in Rome.	 I looked her in the face and saw her led Between her brother and Mark Antony. 

CLEOPATRA Is she as tall as me? 

MESSENGER She is not, madam. 

CLEOPATRA Didst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongued or low?	 

MESSENGER Madam, I heard her speak. She is low-voiced. 

CLEOPATRA That’s not so good. He cannot like her long. 

CHARMIAN Like her? O Isis, ’tis impossible! 

CLEOPATRA I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!—	 What majesty is in her gait? Remember, If e’er thou looked’st on majesty. 

MESSENGER She creeps. Her motion and her station are as one. She shows a body rather than a life,	 A statue than a breather. 

CLEOPATRA Is this certain? 

MESSENGER Or I have no observance. 

CHARMIAN Three in Egypt Cannot make better note.	 

CLEOPATRA He’s very knowing. I do perceive ’t. There’s nothing in her yet. The fellow has good judgment. 

CHARMIAN Excellent. 

CLEOPATRA , to Messenger  Guess at her years, I	 prithee. 

MESSENGER Madam, she was a widow. 

CLEOPATRA  Widow? Charmian, hark. 

MESSENGER And I do think she’s thirty. 

CLEOPATRA Bear’st thou her face in mind? Is ’t long or round?	 

MESSENGER Round even to faultiness. 

CLEOPATRA For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so. Her hair what color? 

MESSENGER Brown, madam, and her forehead As low as she would wish it.	 

CLEOPATRA ,  <ACTION>giving money</ACTION> There’s gold for thee. Thou must not take my former sharpness ill. I will employ thee back again. I find thee Most fit for business. Go, make thee ready. Our letters are prepared.	 <ACTION>Messenger exits.</ACTION> 

CHARMIAN A proper man. 

CLEOPATRA Indeed he is so. I repent me much That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him, This creature’s no such thing. 

CHARMIAN Nothing, madam.	 

CLEOPATRA The man hath seen some majesty, and should know. 

CHARMIAN Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend, And serving you so long! 

CLEOPATRA I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian,	 But ’tis no matter. Thou shalt bring him to me Where I will write. All may be well enough. 

CHARMIAN I warrant you, madam. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
