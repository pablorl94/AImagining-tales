<ACTION>Enter Touchstone and Audrey.</ACTION> 

TOUCHSTONE Tomorrow is the joyful day, Audrey. Tomorrow will we be married. 

AUDREY I do desire it with all my heart, and I hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world.	 

<ACTION>Enter two Pages.</ACTION> 

Here come two of the banished duke’s pages. 

FIRST PAGE Well met, honest gentleman. 

TOUCHSTONE  By my troth, well met. Come, sit, sit, and a song. 

SECOND PAGE We are for you. Sit i’ th’ middle.	 

<ACTION>They sit.</ACTION> 

FIRST PAGE Shall we clap into ’t roundly, without hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues to a bad voice? 

SECOND PAGE I’ faith, i’ faith, and both in a tune like two gypsies on a horse.	 

<ACTION>Song.</ACTION> 

PAGES <ACTION>sing</ACTION> "It was a lover and his lass, With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no, That o’er the green cornfield did pass In springtime, the only pretty ring time, When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.	 Sweet lovers love the spring. 

"Between the acres of the rye, With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no, These pretty country folks would lie In springtime, the only pretty ring time,	 When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding. Sweet lovers love the spring. 

"This carol they began that hour, With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no, How that a life was but a flower	 In springtime, the only pretty ring time, When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding. Sweet lovers love the spring. 

"And therefore take the present time, With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no,	 For love is crownèd with the prime, In springtime, the only pretty ring time, When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding. Sweet lovers love the spring." 

TOUCHSTONE Truly, young gentlemen, though there	 was no great matter in the ditty, yet the note was very untunable. 

FIRST PAGE You are deceived, sir. We kept time. We lost not our time. 

TOUCHSTONE By my troth, yes. I count it but time lost	 to hear such a foolish song. God be wi’ you, and God mend your voices.—Come, Audrey.
