<ACTION>Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and their men.</ACTION> 

BENVOLIO I pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire. The day is hot, the Capels are abroad, And if we meet we shall not ’scape a brawl, For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring. 

MERCUTIO Thou art like one of these fellows that, when	 he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and says “God send me no need of thee” and, by the operation of the second cup, draws him on the drawer when indeed there is no need.	 

BENVOLIO Am I like such a fellow? 

MERCUTIO Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved. 

BENVOLIO And what to?	 

MERCUTIO Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou—why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking	 nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling. Thou hast	 quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? With another, for tying his new shoes with old ribbon?	 And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling? 

BENVOLIO An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter. 

MERCUTIO  The fee simple? O simple!	 

<ACTION>Enter Tybalt, Petruchio, and others.</ACTION> 

BENVOLIO By my head, here comes the Capulets. 

MERCUTIO By my heel, I care not. 

TYBALT ,  <ACTION>to his companions</ACTION> Follow me close, for I will speak to them.— Gentlemen, good e’en. A word with one of you. 

MERCUTIO And but one word with one of us? Couple it	 with something. Make it a word and a blow. 

TYBALT  You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me occasion. 

MERCUTIO Could you not take some occasion without giving?	 

TYBALT Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo. 

MERCUTIO  Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here’s my fiddlestick; here’s that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!	 

BENVOLIO We talk here in the public haunt of men. Either withdraw unto some private place, Or reason coldly of your grievances, Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us. 

MERCUTIO Men’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.	 I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I. 

<ACTION>Enter Romeo.</ACTION> 

TYBALT Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man. 

MERCUTIO But I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery. Marry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower. Your Worship in that sense may call him “man.”	 

TYBALT Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford No better term than this: thou art a villain. 

ROMEO Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting. Villain am I none.	 Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not. 

TYBALT Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me. Therefore turn and draw. 

ROMEO I do protest I never injured thee But love thee better than thou canst devise	 Till thou shalt know the reason of my love. And so, good Capulet, which name I tender As dearly as mine own, be satisfied. 

MERCUTIO O calm, dishonorable, vile submission! Alla stoccato carries it away.	 <ACTION>He draws.  </ACTION> Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk? 

TYBALT What wouldst thou have with me? 

MERCUTIO  Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine lives, that I mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest of the	 eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out. 

TYBALT I am for you.	 <ACTION>He draws.</ACTION> 

ROMEO Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.	 

MERCUTIO Come, sir, your passado.	 <ACTION>They fight.</ACTION> 

ROMEO Draw, Benvolio, beat down their weapons. 

<ACTION>Romeo draws.</ACTION> 

Gentlemen, for shame forbear this outrage! Tybalt! Mercutio! The Prince expressly hath Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.	 Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio! 

<ACTION>Romeo attempts to beat down their rapiers.</ACTION> <ACTION>Tybalt stabs Mercutio.</ACTION> 

PETRUCHIO Away, Tybalt! 

<ACTION>Tybalt, Petruchio, and their followers exit.</ACTION> 

MERCUTIO  I am hurt. A plague o’ both houses! I am sped. Is he gone and hath nothing?	 

BENVOLIO What, art thou hurt? 

MERCUTIO Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, ’tis enough. Where is my page?—Go, villain, fetch a surgeon. 

<ACTION>Page exits.</ACTION> 

ROMEO Courage, man, the hurt cannot be much. 

MERCUTIO No, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as	 a church door, but ’tis enough. ’Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’ both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! A braggart, a rogue, a	 villain that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your arm. 

ROMEO I thought all for the best. 

MERCUTIO Help me into some house, Benvolio,	 Or I shall faint. A plague o’ both your houses! They have made worms’ meat of me. I have it, and soundly, too. Your houses! 

<ACTION>All but Romeo exit.</ACTION> 

ROMEO This gentleman, the Prince’s near ally, My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt	 In my behalf. My reputation stained With Tybalt’s slander—Tybalt, that an hour Hath been my cousin! O sweet Juliet, Thy beauty hath made me effeminate And in my temper softened valor’s steel.	 

<ACTION>Enter Benvolio.</ACTION> 

BENVOLIO O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead. That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds, Which too untimely here did scorn the earth. 

ROMEO This day’s black fate on more days doth depend. This but begins the woe others must end.	 

<ACTION>Enter Tybalt.</ACTION> 

BENVOLIO Here comes the furious Tybalt back again. 

ROMEO Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain! Away to heaven, respective lenity, And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now.— Now, Tybalt, take the “villain” back again	 That late thou gavest me, for Mercutio’s soul Is but a little way above our heads, Staying for thine to keep him company. Either thou or I, or both, must go with him. 

TYBALT Thou wretched boy that didst consort him here	 Shalt with him hence. 

ROMEO  This shall determine that. 

<ACTION>They fight. Tybalt falls.</ACTION> 

BENVOLIO Romeo, away, begone! The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain. Stand not amazed. The Prince will doom thee death	 If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away. 

ROMEO O, I am Fortune’s fool! 

BENVOLIO  Why dost thou stay? 

<ACTION>Romeo exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Citizens.</ACTION> 

CITIZEN Which way ran he that killed Mercutio? Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?	 

BENVOLIO There lies that Tybalt. 

CITIZEN ,  <ACTION>to Tybalt</ACTION> Up, sir, go with me. I charge thee in the Prince’s name, obey. 

<ACTION>Enter Prince, old Montague, Capulet, their Wives and all.</ACTION> 

PRINCE Where are the vile beginners of this fray? 

BENVOLIO O noble prince, I can discover all	 The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl. There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio. 

LADY CAPULET Tybalt, my cousin, O my brother’s child! O prince! O cousin! Husband! O, the blood is spilled	 Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true, For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague. O cousin, cousin! 

PRINCE Benvolio, who began this bloody fray? 

BENVOLIO Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay—	 Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal Your high displeasure. All this utterèd With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bowed Could not take truce with the unruly spleen	 Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts With piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast, Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats Cold death aside and with the other sends	 It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud “Hold, friends! Friends, part!” and swifter than his tongue His agile arm beats down their fatal points,	 And ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled. But by and by comes back to Romeo, Who had but newly entertained revenge,	 And to ’t they go like lightning, for ere I Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain, And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly. This is the truth, or let Benvolio die. 

LADY CAPULET He is a kinsman to the Montague.	 Affection makes him false; he speaks not true. Some twenty of them fought in this black strife, And all those twenty could but kill one life. I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give. Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.	 

PRINCE Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio. Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe? 

MONTAGUE Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio’s friend. His fault concludes but what the law should end, The life of Tybalt.	 

PRINCE And for that offense Immediately we do exile him hence. I have an interest in your hearts’ proceeding: My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding. But I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine	 That you shall all repent the loss of mine. I will be deaf to pleading and excuses. Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses. Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste, Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.	 Bear hence this body and attend our will. Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill. 

<ACTION>They exit, the Capulet menbearing off Tybalt’s body.</ACTION>
