<ACTION>Enter the Second Merchant and Angelo theGoldsmith.</ACTION> 

ANGELO I am sorry, sir, that I have hindered you, But I protest he had the chain of me, Though most dishonestly he doth deny it. 

SECOND MERCHANT How is the man esteemed here in the city? 

ANGELO Of very reverend reputation, sir,	 Of credit infinite, highly beloved, Second to none that lives here in the city. His word might bear my wealth at any time. 

SECOND MERCHANT Speak softly. Yonder, as I think, he walks. 

<ACTION>Enter Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse again,Antipholus wearing the chain.</ACTION> 

ANGELO ’Tis so, and that self chain about his neck	 Which he forswore most monstrously to have. Good sir, draw near to me. I’ll speak to him.— Signior Antipholus, I wonder much That you would put me to this shame and trouble, And not without some scandal to yourself,	 With circumstance and oaths so to deny This chain, which now you wear so openly. Besides the charge, the shame, imprisonment, You have done wrong to this my honest friend, Who, but for staying on our controversy,	 Had hoisted sail and put to sea today. This chain you had of me. Can you deny it? 

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I think I had. I never did deny it. 

SECOND MERCHANT Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?	 

SECOND MERCHANT These ears of mine, thou know’st, did hear thee. Fie on thee, wretch. ’Tis pity that thou liv’st To walk where any honest men resort. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Thou art a villain to impeach me thus. I’ll prove mine honor and mine honesty	 Against thee presently if thou dar’st stand. 

SECOND MERCHANT I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.	 

<ACTION>They draw.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Adriana, Luciana, Courtesan, and others.</ACTION> 

ADRIANA Hold, hurt him not, for God’s sake. He is mad.— Some get within him; take his sword away. Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house!	 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Run, master, run. For God’s sake, take a house. This is some priory. In, or we are spoiled. 

<ACTION>Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuseexit to the Priory.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Lady Abbess.</ACTION> 

ABBESS Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither? 

ADRIANA To fetch my poor distracted husband hence. Let us come in, that we may bind him fast	 And bear him home for his recovery. 

ANGELO I knew he was not in his perfect wits. 

SECOND MERCHANT I am sorry now that I did draw on him. 

ABBESS How long hath this possession held the man? 

ADRIANA This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,	 And much different from the man he was. But till this afternoon his passion Ne’er brake into extremity of rage. 

ABBESS Hath he not lost much wealth by wrack of sea? Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye	 Strayed his affection in unlawful love, A sin prevailing much in youthful men Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing? Which of these sorrows is he subject to? 

ADRIANA To none of these, except it be the last,	 Namely, some love that drew him oft from home. 

ABBESS You should for that have reprehended him. 

ADRIANA Why, so I did. 

ABBESS Ay, but not rough enough. 

ADRIANA As roughly as my modesty would let me.	 

ABBESS Haply in private. 

ADRIANA And in assemblies too. 

ABBESS Ay, but not enough. 

ADRIANA It was the copy of our conference. In bed he slept not for my urging it;	 At board he fed not for my urging it. Alone, it was the subject of my theme; In company I often glancèd it. Still did I tell him it was vile and bad. 

ABBESS And thereof came it that the man was mad.	 The venom clamors of a jealous woman Poisons more deadly than a mad dog’s tooth. It seems his sleeps were hindered by thy railing, And thereof comes it that his head is light. Thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy	 upbraidings. Unquiet meals make ill digestions. Thereof the raging fire of fever bred, And what’s a fever but a fit of madness? Thou sayest his sports were hindered by thy brawls.	 Sweet recreation barred, what doth ensue But moody and dull melancholy, Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair, And at her heels a huge infectious troop Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?	 In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest To be disturbed would mad or man or beast. The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits Hath scared thy husband from the use of wits. 

LUCIANA She never reprehended him but mildly	 When he demeaned himself rough, rude, and wildly.— Why bear you these rebukes and answer not? 

ADRIANA She did betray me to my own reproof.— Good people, enter and lay hold on him.	 

ABBESS No, not a creature enters in my house. 

ADRIANA Then let your servants bring my husband forth. 

ABBESS Neither. He took this place for sanctuary, And it shall privilege him from your hands Till I have brought him to his wits again	 Or lose my labor in assaying it. 

ADRIANA I will attend my husband, be his nurse, Diet his sickness, for it is my office And will have no attorney but myself; And therefore let me have him home with me.	 

ABBESS Be patient, for I will not let him stir Till I have used the approvèd means I have, With wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers, To make of him a formal man again. It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,	 A charitable duty of my order. Therefore depart and leave him here with me. 

ADRIANA I will not hence and leave my husband here; And ill it doth beseem your holiness To separate the husband and the wife.	 

ABBESS Be quiet and depart. Thou shalt not have him. 

<ACTION>She exits.</ACTION> 

LUCIANA ,  <ACTION>to Adriana</ACTION> Complain unto the Duke of this indignity. 

ADRIANA Come, go. I will fall prostrate at his feet And never rise until my tears and prayers Have won his grace to come in person hither	 And take perforce my husband from the Abbess. 

SECOND MERCHANT By this, I think, the dial points at five. Anon, I’m sure, the Duke himself in person Comes this way to the melancholy vale, The place of death and sorry execution	 Behind the ditches of the abbey here. 

ANGELO Upon what cause? 

SECOND MERCHANT To see a reverend Syracusian merchant, Who put unluckily into this bay Against the laws and statutes of this town,	 Beheaded publicly for his offense. 

ANGELO See where they come. We will behold his death. 

LUCIANA ,  <ACTION>to Adriana</ACTION> Kneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey. 

<ACTION>Enter the Duke of Ephesus, and Egeon the Merchantof Syracuse, bare head, with the Headsmanand other Officers.</ACTION> 

DUKE Yet once again proclaim it publicly, If any friend will pay the sum for him,	 He shall not die; so much we tender him. 

ADRIANA ,  <ACTION>kneeling</ACTION> Justice, most sacred duke, against the Abbess. 

DUKE She is a virtuous and a reverend lady. It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong. 

ADRIANA May it please your Grace, Antipholus my husband,	 Who I made lord of me and all I had At your important letters, this ill day A most outrageous fit of madness took him, That desp’rately he hurried through the street, With him his bondman, all as mad as he,	 Doing displeasure to the citizens By rushing in their houses, bearing thence Rings, jewels, anything his rage did like. Once did I get him bound and sent him home Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went	 That here and there his fury had committed. Anon, I wot not by what strong escape, He broke from those that had the guard of him, And with his mad attendant and himself, Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,	 Met us again and, madly bent on us, Chased us away, till raising of more aid, We came again to bind them. Then they fled Into this abbey, whither we pursued them, And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us	 And will not suffer us to fetch him out, Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence. Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help. 

DUKE Long since, thy husband served me in my wars,	 And I to thee engaged a prince’s word, When thou didst make him master of thy bed, To do him all the grace and good I could. Go, some of you, knock at the abbey gate, And bid the Lady Abbess come to me.	 I will determine this before I stir.	 

<ACTION>Adriana rises.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter a Messenger.</ACTION> 

MESSENGER O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself. My master and his man are both broke loose, Beaten the maids a-row, and bound the doctor, Whose beard they have singed off with brands of	 fire, And ever as it blazed they threw on him Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair. My master preaches patience to him, and the while His man with scissors nicks him like a fool;	 And sure, unless you send some present help, Between them they will kill the conjurer. 

ADRIANA Peace, fool. Thy master and his man are here, And that is false thou dost report to us. 

MESSENGER Mistress, upon my life I tell you true.	 I have not breathed almost since I did see it. He cries for you and vows, if he can take you, To scorch your face and to disfigure you.	 <ACTION>Cry within.</ACTION> Hark, hark, I hear him, mistress. Fly, begone! 

DUKE Come, stand by me. Fear nothing.—Guard with	190 halberds. 

<ACTION>Enter Antipholus and Dromio of Ephesus.</ACTION> 

ADRIANA Ay me, it is my husband. Witness you That he is borne about invisible. Even now we housed him in the abbey here, And now he’s there, past thought of human reason.	 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Justice, most gracious duke. O, grant me justice, Even for the service that long since I did thee When I bestrid thee in the wars and took Deep scars to save thy life. Even for the blood That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.	 

EGEON , <ACTION> aside</ACTION> Unless the fear of death doth make me dote, I see my son Antipholus and Dromio. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there, She whom thou gav’st to me to be my wife, That hath abusèd and dishonored me	 Even in the strength and height of injury. Beyond imagination is the wrong That she this day hath shameless thrown on me. 

DUKE Discover how, and thou shalt find me just. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me	 While she with harlots feasted in my house. 

DUKE A grievous fault.—Say, woman, didst thou so? 

ADRIANA No, my good lord. Myself, he, and my sister Today did dine together. So befall my soul As this is false he burdens me withal.	 

LUCIANA Ne’er may I look on day nor sleep on night But she tells to your Highness simple truth. 

ANGELO O perjured woman!—They are both forsworn. In this the madman justly chargeth them. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS My liege, I am advisèd what I say,	 Neither disturbed with the effect of wine, Nor heady-rash provoked with raging ire, Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad. This woman locked me out this day from dinner. That goldsmith there, were he not packed with her,	 Could witness it, for he was with me then, Who parted with me to go fetch a chain, Promising to bring it to the Porpentine, Where Balthasar and I did dine together. Our dinner done and he not coming thither,	 I went to seek him. In the street I met him, And in his company that gentleman. 

<ACTION>He points to Second Merchant.</ACTION> 

There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down That I this day of him received the chain, Which, God He knows, I saw not; for the which	 He did arrest me with an officer. I did obey and sent my peasant home For certain ducats. He with none returned. Then fairly I bespoke the officer To go in person with me to my house.	 By th’ way we met My wife, her sister, and a rabble more Of vile confederates. Along with them They brought one Pinch, a hungry, lean-faced villain,	 A mere anatomy, a mountebank, A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller, A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch, A living dead man. This pernicious slave, Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,	 And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse, And with no face (as ’twere) outfacing me, Cries out I was possessed. Then all together They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence, And in a dark and dankish vault at home	 There left me and my man, both bound together, Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder, I gained my freedom and immediately Ran hither to your Grace, whom I beseech To give me ample satisfaction	 For these deep shames and great indignities. 

ANGELO My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him: That he dined not at home, but was locked out. 

DUKE But had he such a chain of thee or no? 

ANGELO He had, my lord, and when he ran in here,	 These people saw the chain about his neck. 

SECOND MERCHANT , <ACTION> to Antipholus of Ephesus</ACTION> Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine Heard you confess you had the chain of him After you first forswore it on the mart, And thereupon I drew my sword on you,	 And then you fled into this abbey here, From whence I think you are come by miracle. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I never came within these abbey walls, Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me. I never saw the chain, so help me heaven,	 And this is false you burden me withal. 

DUKE Why, what an intricate impeach is this! I think you all have drunk of Circe’s cup. If here you housed him, here he would have been. If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.	 <ACTION>To Adriana. </ACTION> You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here Denies that saying.  <ACTION>To Dromio of Ephesus. </ACTION> Sirrah, what say you? 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS ,  <ACTION>pointing to the Courtesan</ACTION> Sir, he dined with her there at the Porpentine.	285 

COURTESAN He did, and from my finger snatched that ring. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS , <ACTION> showing a ring</ACTION> ’Tis true, my liege, this ring I had of her. 

DUKE ,  <ACTION>to Courtesan</ACTION> Saw’st thou him enter at the abbey here? 

COURTESAN As sure, my liege, as I do see your Grace. 

DUKE Why, this is strange.—Go call the Abbess hither.	 

<ACTION>Exit one to the Abbess.</ACTION> 

I think you are all mated or stark mad. 

EGEON Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word. Haply I see a friend will save my life And pay the sum that may deliver me. 

DUKE Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.	 

EGEON ,  <ACTION>to Antipholus of Ephesus</ACTION> Is not your name, sir, called Antipholus? And is not that your bondman Dromio? 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS Within this hour I was his bondman, sir, But he, I thank him, gnawed in two my cords. Now am I Dromio, and his man, unbound.	 

EGEON I am sure you both of you remember me. 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you, For lately we were bound as you are now. You are not Pinch’s patient, are you, sir? 

EGEON ,  <ACTION>to Antipholus of Ephesus</ACTION> Why look you strange on me? You know me well.	 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I never saw you in my life till now. 

EGEON O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last, And careful hours with time’s deformèd hand Have written strange defeatures in my face. But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?	 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS  Neither. 

EGEON Dromio, nor thou? 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS No, trust me, sir, nor I. 

EGEON I am sure thou dost. 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not, and	 whatsoever a man denies, you are now bound to believe him. 

EGEON Not know my voice! O time’s extremity, Hast thou so cracked and splitted my poor tongue In seven short years that here my only son	 Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares? Though now this grainèd face of mine be hid In sap-consuming winter’s drizzled snow, And all the conduits of my blood froze up, Yet hath my night of life some memory,	 My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left, My dull deaf ears a little use to hear. All these old witnesses—I cannot err— Tell me thou art my son Antipholus. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I never saw my father in my life.	 

EGEON But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy, Thou know’st we parted. But perhaps, my son, Thou sham’st to acknowledge me in misery. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS The Duke and all that know me in the city Can witness with me that it is not so.	 I ne’er saw Syracusa in my life. 

DUKE I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years Have I been patron to Antipholus, During which time he ne’er saw Syracusa. I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.	 

<ACTION>Enter Emilia the Abbess, with Antipholus ofSyracuse and Dromio of Syracuse.</ACTION> 

ABBESS Most mighty duke, behold a man much wronged. 

<ACTION>All gather to see them.</ACTION> 

ADRIANA I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me. 

DUKE One of these men is genius to the other. And so, of these, which is the natural man And which the spirit? Who deciphers them?	 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I, sir, am Dromio. Command him away. 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS I, sir, am Dromio. Pray, let me stay. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Egeon art thou not, or else his ghost? 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE O, my old master.—Who hath bound him here? 

ABBESS Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds	 And gain a husband by his liberty.— Speak, old Egeon, if thou be’st the man That hadst a wife once called Emilia, That bore thee at a burden two fair sons. O, if thou be’st the same Egeon, speak,	 And speak unto the same Emilia. 

DUKE Why, here begins his morning story right: These two Antipholus’, these two so like, And these two Dromios, one in semblance— Besides her urging of her wrack at sea—	 These are the parents to these children, Which accidentally are met together. 

EGEON If I dream not, thou art Emilia. If thou art she, tell me, where is that son That floated with thee on the fatal raft?	 

ABBESS By men of Epidamium he and I And the twin Dromio all were taken up; But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth By force took Dromio and my son from them, And me they left with those of Epidamium.	 What then became of them I cannot tell; I to this fortune that you see me in. 

DUKE ,  <ACTION>to Antipholus of Syracuse</ACTION> Antipholus, thou cam’st from Corinth first. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE No, sir, not I. I came from Syracuse. 

DUKE Stay, stand apart. I know not which is which.	 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord. 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS And I with him. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Brought to this town by that most famous warrior Duke Menaphon, your most renownèd uncle. 

ADRIANA Which of you two did dine with me today?	 

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I, gentle mistress. 

ADRIANA And are not you my husband? 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS No, I say nay to that. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE And so do I, yet did she call me so, And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,	 Did call me brother.  <ACTION>To Luciana.</ACTION> What I told you then I hope I shall have leisure to make good, If this be not a dream I see and hear. 

ANGELO ,  <ACTION>turning to Antipholus of Syracuse</ACTION> That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.	 

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I think it be, sir. I deny it not. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS ,  <ACTION>to Angelo</ACTION> And you, sir, for this chain arrested me. 

ANGELO I think I did, sir. I deny it not. 

ADRIANA , <ACTION> to Antipholus of Ephesus</ACTION> I sent you money, sir, to be your bail By Dromio, but I think he brought it not.	 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS No, none by me. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE ,  <ACTION>to Adriana</ACTION> This purse of ducats I received from you, And Dromio my man did bring them me. I see we still did meet each other’s man, And I was ta’en for him, and he for me,	 And thereupon these errors are arose. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS , <ACTION> to the Duke</ACTION> These ducats pawn I for my father here. 

DUKE It shall not need. Thy father hath his life. 

COURTESAN , <ACTION> to Antipholus of Ephesus</ACTION> Sir, I must have that diamond from you. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS There, take it, and much thanks for my good cheer.	 

ABBESS Renownèd duke, vouchsafe to take the pains To go with us into the abbey here And hear at large discoursèd all our fortunes, And all that are assembled in this place That by this sympathizèd one day’s error	 Have suffered wrong. Go, keep us company, And we shall make full satisfaction.— Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail Of you, my sons, and till this present hour My heavy burden ne’er deliverèd.—	 The Duke, my husband, and my children both, And you, the calendars of their nativity, Go to a gossips’ feast, and go with me. After so long grief, such nativity! 

DUKE With all my heart I’ll gossip at this feast.	 

<ACTION>All exit except the two Dromiosand the two brothers Antipholus.</ACTION> 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE , <ACTION> to Antipholus of Ephesus</ACTION> Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard? 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embarked? 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE ,  <ACTION>to Antipholus of Ephesus</ACTION> He speaks to me.—I am your master, Dromio. Come, go with us. We’ll look to that anon.	 Embrace thy brother there. Rejoice with him. 

<ACTION>The brothers Antipholus exit.</ACTION> 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE There is a fat friend at your master’s house That kitchened me for you today at dinner. She now shall be my sister, not my wife. 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother.	 I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth. Will you walk in to see their gossiping? 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE  Not I, sir. You are my elder. 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS That’s a question. How shall we try it?	 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE We’ll draw cuts for the signior. Till then, lead thou first. 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS Nay, then, thus: We came into the world like brother and brother, And now let’s go hand in hand, not one before	 another. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
