<ACTION>Enter the King, Simonides, reading of a letter at onedoor; the Knights meet him.</ACTION> 

FIRST KNIGHT Good morrow to the good Simonides. 

SIMONIDES Knights, from my daughter this I let you know, That for this twelvemonth she’ll not undertake A married life. Her reason to herself is only known, Which from her by no means can I get.	 

SECOND KNIGHT May we not get access to her, my lord? 

SIMONIDES Faith, by no means; she hath so strictly tied her To her chamber that ’tis impossible. One twelve moons more she’ll wear Diana’s livery. This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vowed,	 And on her virgin honor will not break it. 

THIRD KNIGHT Loath to bid farewell, we take our leaves. 

<ACTION>The Knights exit.</ACTION> 

SIMONIDES So, They are well dispatched. Now to my daughter’s letter. She tells me here she’ll wed the stranger knight	 Or never more to view nor day nor light. ’Tis well, mistress, your choice agrees with mine. I like that well. Nay, how absolute she’s in ’t, Not minding whether I dislike or no! Well, I do commend her choice, and will no longer	 Have it be delayed. Soft, here he comes. I must dissemble it. 

<ACTION>Enter Pericles.</ACTION> 

PERICLES All fortune to the good Simonides. 

SIMONIDES To you as much. Sir, I am beholding to you For your sweet music this last night. I do Protest, my ears were never better fed With such delightful pleasing harmony. 

PERICLES It is your Grace’s pleasure to commend, Not my desert. 

SIMONIDES Sir, you are music’s master.	 

PERICLES The worst of all her scholars, my good lord. 

SIMONIDES  Let me ask you one thing: What do you think of my daughter, sir? 

PERICLES A most virtuous princess. 

SIMONIDES And she is fair too, is she not?	 

PERICLES As a fair day in summer, wondrous fair. 

SIMONIDES Sir, my daughter thinks very well of you, Ay, so well that you must be her master, And she will be your scholar. Therefore, look to it. 

PERICLES I am unworthy for her schoolmaster.	 

SIMONIDES She thinks not so. Peruse this writing else. 

PERICLES ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> What’s here? A letter that she loves the knight of Tyre? ’Tis the King’s subtlety to have my life.— O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,	 A stranger and distressèd gentleman That never aimed so high to love your daughter, But bent all offices to honor her. 

SIMONIDES Thou hast bewitched my daughter, and thou art A villain.	 

PERICLES  By the gods, I have not! Never did thought of mine levy offense; Nor never did my actions yet commence A deed might gain her love or your displeasure. 

SIMONIDES Traitor, thou liest!	 

PERICLES Traitor? 

SIMONIDES Ay, traitor. 

PERICLES Even in his throat, unless it be the King That calls me traitor, I return the lie. 

SIMONIDES ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Now, by the gods, I do applaud his courage.	 

PERICLES My actions are as noble as my thoughts, That never relished of a base descent. I came unto your court for honor’s cause, And not to be a rebel to her state, And he that otherwise accounts of me,	 This sword shall prove he’s honor’s enemy. 

SIMONIDES No? Here comes my daughter. She can witness it. 

<ACTION>Enter Thaisa.</ACTION> 

PERICLES Then as you are as virtuous as fair, Resolve your angry father if my tongue	 Did e’er solicit or my hand subscribe To any syllable that made love to you. 

THAISA Why, sir, say if you had, who takes offense At that would make me glad? 

SIMONIDES Yea, mistress, are you so peremptory?	 <ACTION>(Aside.) </ACTION> I am glad on ’t with all my heart.— I’ll tame you! I’ll bring you in subjection. Will you, not having my consent, Bestow your love and your affections Upon a stranger?  <ACTION>(Aside.) </ACTION> Who, for aught I know,	 May be—nor can I think the contrary— As great in blood as I myself.— Therefore, hear you, mistress: either frame Your will to mine—and you, sir, hear you: Either be ruled by me—or I’ll make you	 Man and wife. Nay, come, your hands and lips must seal it too. And being joined, I’ll thus your hopes destroy. And for further grief—God give you joy! What, are you both pleased?	 

THAISA  Yes,  <ACTION>(to Pericles) </ACTION> if you love me, sir. 

PERICLES Even as my life my blood that fosters it. 

SIMONIDES What, are you both agreed? 

BOTH Yes, if ’t please your Majesty. 

SIMONIDES It pleaseth me so well that I will see you wed, And then with what haste you can, get you to bed. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
