<ACTION>Enter Cloten and Lords.</ACTION> 

FIRST LORD  Your Lordship is the most patient man in loss, the most coldest that ever turned up ace. 

CLOTEN  It would make any man cold to lose. 

FIRST LORD But not every man patient after the noble temper of your Lordship. You are most hot and	 furious when you win. 

CLOTEN  Winning will put any man into courage. If I could get this foolish Imogen, I should have gold enough. It’s almost morning, is ’t not? 

FIRST LORD  Day, my lord.	 

CLOTEN I would this music would come. I am advised to give her music a-mornings; they say it will penetrate. 

<ACTION>Enter Musicians.</ACTION> 

Come on, tune. If you can penetrate her with your fingering, so. We’ll try with tongue, too. If none	 will do, let her remain, but I’ll never give o’er. First, a very excellent good-conceited thing; after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich words to it, and then let her consider. 

<ACTION>Musicians begin to play.</ACTION> <ACTION>Song.</ACTION> 

Hark, hark, the lark at heaven’s gate sings,	 And Phoebus gins arise, His steeds to water at those springs On chaliced flowers that lies; And winking Mary-buds begin To ope their golden eyes.	 With everything that pretty is, My lady sweet, arise, Arise, arise. 

CLOTEN   So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will consider your music the better. If it do not, it is a	 vice in her ears which horsehairs and calves’ guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to boot, can never amend. 

<ACTION>Musicians exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Cymbeline and Queen, with Attendants.</ACTION> 

SECOND LORD Here comes the King. 

CLOTEN I am glad I was up so late, for that’s the reason	 I was up so early. He cannot choose but take this service I have done fatherly.—Good morrow to your Majesty and to my gracious mother. 

CYMBELINE Attend you here the door of our stern daughter? Will she not forth?	 

CLOTEN   I have assailed her with musics, but she vouchsafes no notice. 

CYMBELINE The exile of her minion is too new; She hath not yet forgot him. Some more time Must wear the print of his remembrance on ’t,	 And then she’s yours. 

QUEEN ,  <ACTION>to Cloten</ACTION> You are most bound to th’ King, Who lets go by no vantages that may Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself To orderly solicits and be friended	 With aptness of the season. Make denials Increase your services. So seem as if You were inspired to do those duties which You tender to her; that you in all obey her, Save when command to your dismission tends,	 And therein you are senseless. 

CLOTEN Senseless? Not so. 

<ACTION>Enter a Messenger.</ACTION> 

MESSENGER , <ACTION> to Cymbeline</ACTION> So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome; The one is Caius Lucius.	Messenger exits. 

CYMBELINE A worthy fellow,	 Albeit he comes on angry purpose now. But that’s no fault of his. We must receive him According to the honor of his sender, And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us, We must extend our notice.—Our dear son,	 When you have given good morning to your mistress, Attend the Queen and us. We shall have need T’ employ you towards this Roman.—Come, our queen. 

<ACTION>Cymbeline and Queen exit, withLords and Attendants.</ACTION> 

CLOTEN If she be up, I’ll speak with her; if not,	 Let her lie still and dream.  <ACTION>(He knocks.)</ACTION> By your leave, ho!— I know her women are about her. What If I do line one of their hands? ’Tis gold Which buys admittance—oft it doth—yea, and makes	 Diana’s rangers false themselves, yield up Their deer to th’ stand o’ th’ stealer; and ’tis gold Which makes the true man killed and saves the thief, Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man. What Can it not do and undo? I will make	 One of her women lawyer to me, for I yet not understand the case myself. By your leave.	 <ACTION>Knocks.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter a Lady.</ACTION> 

LADY Who’s there that knocks? 

CLOTEN A gentleman. 

LADY No more? 

CLOTEN Yes, and a gentlewoman’s son. 

LADY That’s more Than some whose tailors are as dear as yours Can justly boast of. What’s your Lordship’s pleasure?	 

CLOTEN Your lady’s person. Is she ready? 

LADY Ay, To keep her chamber. 

CLOTEN There is gold for you. Sell me your good report. <ACTION>	He offers a purse.</ACTION> 

LADY How, my good name? Or to report of you What I shall think is good? 

<ACTION>Enter Imogen.</ACTION> 

The Princess. <ACTION>Lady exits.</ACTION> 

CLOTEN Good morrow, fairest sister. Your sweet hand. 

IMOGEN Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains	 For purchasing but trouble. The thanks I give Is telling you that I am poor of thanks And scarce can spare them. 

CLOTEN   Still I swear I love you. 

IMOGEN If you but said so, ’twere as deep with me.	 If you swear still, your recompense is still That I regard it not. 

CLOTEN  This is no answer. 

IMOGEN But that you shall not say I yield being silent, I would not speak. I pray you, spare me. Faith,	 I shall unfold equal discourtesy To your best kindness. One of your great knowing Should learn, being taught, forbearance. 

CLOTEN To leave you in your madness ’twere my sin. I will not.	 

IMOGEN Fools are not mad folks. 

CLOTEN   Do you call me fool? 

IMOGEN As I am mad, I do. If you’ll be patient, I’ll no more be mad. That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,	 You put me to forget a lady’s manners By being so verbal; and learn now for all That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce, By th’ very truth of it, I care not for you, And am so near the lack of charity	 To accuse myself I hate you—which I had rather You felt than make ’t my boast. 

CLOTEN  You sin against Obedience, which you owe your father. For The contract you pretend with that base wretch—	 One bred of alms and fostered with cold dishes, With scraps o’ th’ court—it is no contract, none; And though it be allowed in meaner parties— Yet who than he more mean?—to knit their souls, On whom there is no more dependency	 But brats and beggary, in self-figured knot; Yet you are curbed from that enlargement by The consequence o’ th’ crown, and must not foil The precious note of it with a base slave, A hilding for a livery, a squire’s cloth,	 A pantler—not so eminent. 

IMOGEN Profane fellow, Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more But what thou art besides, thou wert too base To be his groom. Thou wert dignified enough,	 Even to the point of envy, if ’twere made Comparative for your virtues to be styled The under-hangman of his kingdom and hated For being preferred so well. 

CLOTEN The south fog rot him!	 

IMOGEN He never can meet more mischance than come To be but named of thee. His mean’st garment That ever hath but clipped his body is dearer In my respect than all the hairs above thee, Were they all made such men.—How now, Pisanio!	 

<ACTION>Enter Pisanio.</ACTION> 

CLOTEN “His garment”? Now the devil— 

IMOGEN ,  <ACTION>to Pisanio</ACTION> To Dorothy, my woman, hie thee presently. 

CLOTEN “His garment”? 

IMOGEN , <ACTION> to Pisanio</ACTION> I am sprighted with a fool, Frighted and angered worse. Go bid my woman	 Search for a jewel that too casually Hath left mine arm. It was thy master’s. Shrew me If I would lose it for a revenue Of any king’s in Europe. I do think I saw ’t this morning. Confident I am	 Last night ’twas on mine arm; I kissed it. I hope it be not gone to tell my lord That I kiss aught but he. 

PISANIO ’Twill not be lost. 

IMOGEN I hope so. Go and search. <ACTION>	Pisanio exits.</ACTION> 

CLOTEN You have abused me. “His meanest garment”? 

IMOGEN Ay, I said so, sir. If you will make ’t an action, call witness to ’t. 

CLOTEN I will inform your father.	 

IMOGEN Your mother too. She’s my good lady and will conceive, I hope, But the worst of me. So I leave you, sir, To th’ worst of discontent.	 <ACTION>She exits.</ACTION> 

CLOTEN I’ll be revenged! “His mean’st garment”? Well.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
