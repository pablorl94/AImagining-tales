<ACTION>Thunder and lightning. Enter Casca and Cicero.</ACTION> 

CICERO Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home? Why are you breathless? And why stare you so? 

CASCA Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero, I have seen tempests when the scolding winds	 Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen Th’ ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam To be exalted with the threat’ning clouds; But never till tonight, never till now, Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.	 Either there is a civil strife in heaven, Or else the world, too saucy with the gods, Incenses them to send destruction. 

CICERO Why, saw you anything more wonderful? 

CASCA A common slave (you know him well by sight)	 Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn Like twenty torches joined; and yet his hand, Not sensible of fire, remained unscorched. Besides (I ha’ not since put up my sword), Against the Capitol I met a lion,	 Who glazed upon me and went surly by Without annoying me. And there were drawn Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women, Transformèd with their fear, who swore they saw Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.	 And yesterday the bird of night did sit Even at noonday upon the marketplace, Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies Do so conjointly meet, let not men say “These are their reasons, they are natural,”	 For I believe they are portentous things Unto the climate that they point upon. 

CICERO Indeed, it is a strange-disposèd time. But men may construe things after their fashion, Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.	 Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow? 

CASCA He doth, for he did bid Antonius Send word to you he would be there tomorrow. 

CICERO Good night then, Casca. This disturbèd sky Is not to walk in.	 

CASCA Farewell, Cicero. 

<ACTION>Cicero exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Cassius.</ACTION> 

CASSIUS Who’s there? 

CASCA A Roman. 

CASSIUS Casca, by your voice. 

CASCA Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!	 

CASSIUS A very pleasing night to honest men. 

CASCA Who ever knew the heavens menace so? 

CASSIUS Those that have known the Earth so full of faults. For my part, I have walked about the streets, Submitting me unto the perilous night,	 And thus unbracèd, Casca, as you see, Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone; And when the cross blue lightning seemed to open The breast of heaven, I did present myself Even in the aim and very flash of it.	5 

CASCA But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens? It is the part of men to fear and tremble When the most mighty gods by tokens send Such dreadful heralds to astonish us. 

CASSIUS You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life	 That should be in a Roman you do want, Or else you use not. You look pale, and gaze, And put on fear, and cast yourself in wonder, To see the strange impatience of the heavens. But if you would consider the true cause	 Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts, Why birds and beasts from quality and kind, Why old men, fools, and children calculate, Why all these things change from their ordinance, Their natures, and preformèd faculties,	 To monstrous quality—why, you shall find That heaven hath infused them with these spirits To make them instruments of fear and warning Unto some monstrous state. Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man	 Most like this dreadful night, That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars As doth the lion in the Capitol; A man no mightier than thyself or me In personal action, yet prodigious grown,	 And fearful, as these strange eruptions are. 

CASCA ’Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius? 

CASSIUS Let it be who it is. For Romans now Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors. But, woe the while, our fathers’ minds are dead,	 And we are governed with our mothers’ spirits. Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish. 

CASCA Indeed, they say the Senators tomorrow Mean to establish Caesar as a king, And he shall wear his crown by sea and land	 In every place save here in Italy. 

CASSIUS I know where I will wear this dagger then; Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius. Therein, you gods, you make the weak most strong; Therein, you gods, you tyrants do defeat.	 Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass, Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron, Can be retentive to the strength of spirit; But life, being weary of these worldly bars, Never lacks power to dismiss itself.	1 If I know this, know all the world besides, That part of tyranny that I do bear I can shake off at pleasure.	 

<ACTION>Thunder still.</ACTION> 

CASCA So can I. So every bondman in his own hand bears	 The power to cancel his captivity. 

CASSIUS And why should Caesar be a tyrant, then? Poor man, I know he would not be a wolf But that he sees the Romans are but sheep; He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.	 Those that with haste will make a mighty fire Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome, What rubbish, and what offal when it serves For the base matter to illuminate So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,	 Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this Before a willing bondman; then, I know My answer must be made. But I am armed, And dangers are to me indifferent. 

CASCA You speak to Casca, and to such a man	 That is no fleering telltale. Hold. My hand. They shake hands. Be factious for redress of all these griefs, And I will set this foot of mine as far As who goes farthest. 

CASSIUS There’s a bargain made.	 Now know you, Casca, I have moved already Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans To undergo with me an enterprise Of honorable-dangerous consequence. And I do know by this they stay for me	 In Pompey’s Porch. For now, this fearful night, There is no stir or walking in the streets; And the complexion of the element In favor ’s like the work we have in hand, Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.	 

<ACTION>Enter Cinna.</ACTION> 

CASCA Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste. 

CASSIUS ’Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait. He is a friend.—Cinna, where haste you so? 

CINNA To find out you. Who’s that? Metellus Cimber? 

CASSIUS No, it is Casca, one incorporate	 To our attempts. Am I not stayed for, Cinna? 

CINNA I am glad on ’t. What a fearful night is this! There’s two or three of us have seen strange sights. 

CASSIUS Am I not stayed for? Tell me. 

CINNA Yes, you are. O Cassius, if you could	 But win the noble Brutus to our party— 

CASSIUS ,  <ACTION>handing him papers</ACTION> Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper, And look you lay it in the Praetor’s chair, Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this In at his window; set this up with wax	 Upon old Brutus’ statue. All this done, Repair to Pompey’s Porch, where you shall find us. Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there? 

CINNA All but Metellus Cimber, and he’s gone To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie	 And so bestow these papers as you bade me. 

CASSIUS That done, repair to Pompey’s Theater. 

<ACTION>Cinna exits.</ACTION> 

Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day See Brutus at his house. Three parts of him Is ours already, and the man entire	 Upon the next encounter yields him ours. 

CASCA O, he sits high in all the people’s hearts, And that which would appear offense in us His countenance, like richest alchemy, Will change to virtue and to worthiness.	 

CASSIUS Him and his worth and our great need of him You have right well conceited. Let us go, For it is after midnight, and ere day We will awake him and be sure of him. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
