<ACTION>Alarum and excursions. Enter King Edward,wearing the white rose, bringing forth Warwick,wearing the red rose, wounded.</ACTION> 

KING EDWARD So, lie thou there. Die thou, and die our fear, For Warwick was a bug that feared us all. Now, Montague, sit fast. I seek for thee, That Warwick’s bones may keep thine company. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

WARWICK Ah, who is nigh? Come to me, friend or foe,	 And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick? Why ask I that? My mangled body shows, My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows That I must yield my body to the earth And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe <ACTION>. </ACTION> Thus yields the cedar to the axe’s edge, Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle, Under whose shade the ramping lion slept, Whose top branch overpeered Jove’s spreading tree And kept low shrubs from winter’s pow’rful wind. These eyes, that now are dimmed with death’s black veil, Have been as piercing as the midday sun To search the secret treasons of the world. The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,	 Were likened oft to kingly sepulchers, For who lived king but I could dig his grave? And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow? Lo, now my glory smeared in dust and blood! My parks, my walks, my manors that I had	 Even now forsake me; and of all my lands Is nothing left me but my body’s length. 

Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?And live we how we can, yet die we must. 

<ACTION>Enter Oxford and Somerset, both wearing the red rose.</ACTION> 

SOMERSET Ah, Warwick, Warwick, wert thou as we are,	 We might recover all our loss again. The Queen from France hath brought a puissant power; Even now we heard the news. Ah, could’st thou fly— 

WARWICK Why, then, I would not fly. Ah, Montague,	 If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile. Thou lov’st me not, for, brother, if thou didst, Thy tears would wash this cold congealèd blood That glues my lips and will not let me speak.	 Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead. 

SOMERSET Ah, Warwick, Montague hath breathed his last, And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick, And said “Commend me to my valiant brother.” And more he would have said, and more he spoke,	 Which sounded like a cannon in a vault, That mought not be distinguished, but at last I well might hear, delivered with a groan, “O, farewell, Warwick.” 

WARWICK Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves,	 For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven. 

<ACTION>He dies.</ACTION> 

OXFORD Away, away, to meet the Queen’s great power! Here they bear away his body.  

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
