<ACTION>Enter Cleopatra and her maids aloft, withCharmian and Iras.</ACTION> 

CLEOPATRA O Charmian, I will never go from hence. 

CHARMIAN Be comforted, dear madam. 

CLEOPATRA No, I will not. All strange and terrible events are welcome, But comforts we despise. Our size of sorrow,	 Proportioned to our cause, must be as great As that which makes it. 

<ACTION>Enter Diomedes below.</ACTION> 

How now? Is he dead? 

DIOMEDES His death’s upon him, but not dead. Look out o’ th’ other side your monument.	 His guard have brought him thither. 

<ACTION>Enter Antony below, and the Guard bearing him.</ACTION> 

CLEOPATRA O sun, Burn the great sphere thou mov’st in. Darkling stand The varying shore o’ th’ world! O Antony, Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian! Help, Iras, help!	 Help, friends below! Let’s draw him hither. 

ANTONY Peace! Not Caesar’s valor hath o’erthrown Antony, But Antony’s hath triumphed on itself. 

CLEOPATRA So it should be that none but Antony	 Should conquer Antony, but woe ’tis so! 

ANTONY I am dying, Egypt, dying. Only I here importune death awhile until Of many thousand kisses the poor last I lay upon thy lips.	 

CLEOPATRA I dare not, dear, Dear my lord, pardon, I dare not, Lest I be taken. Not th’ imperious show Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall Be brooched with me; if knife, drugs, serpents have	 Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe. Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes And still conclusion, shall acquire no honor Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony.— Help me, my women!—We must draw thee up.—	 Assist, good friends.	 

<ACTION>They begin lifting him.</ACTION> 

ANTONY O, quick, or I am gone. 

CLEOPATRA Here’s sport indeed. How heavy weighs my lord! Our strength is all gone into heaviness; That makes the weight. Had I great Juno’s power,	 The strong-winged Mercury should fetch thee up And set thee by Jove’s side. Yet come a little. Wishers were ever fools. O, come, come, come! 

<ACTION>They heave Antony aloft to Cleopatra.</ACTION> 

And welcome, welcome! Die when thou hast lived; Quicken with kissing. Had my lips that power,	 Thus would I wear them out.	 <ACTION>She kisses him.</ACTION> 

ALL A heavy sight! 

ANTONY I am dying, Egypt, dying. Give me some wine, and let me speak a little. 

CLEOPATRA No, let me speak, and let me rail so high	 That the false huswife Fortune break her wheel, Provoked by my offense. 

ANTONY One word, sweet queen: Of Caesar seek your honor with your safety—O! 

CLEOPATRA They do not go together.	 

ANTONY  Gentle, hear me. None about Caesar trust but Proculeius. 

CLEOPATRA My resolution and my hands I’ll trust, None about Caesar. 

ANTONY The miserable change now at my end	 Lament nor sorrow at, but please your thoughts In feeding them with those my former fortunes Wherein I lived the greatest prince o’ th’ world, The noblest, and do now not basely die, Not cowardly put off my helmet to	 My countryman—a Roman by a Roman Valiantly vanquished. Now my spirit is going; I can no more. 

CLEOPATRA  Noblest of men, woo’t die? Hast thou no care of me? Shall I abide	 In this dull world, which in thy absence is No better than a sty? O see, my women, The crown o’ th’ Earth doth melt.—My lord! 

<ACTION>Antony dies.</ACTION> 

O, withered is the garland of the war; The soldier’s pole is fall’n; young boys and girls	 Are level now with men. The odds is gone, And there is nothing left remarkable Beneath the visiting moon. 

CHARMIAN O, quietness, lady! 

<ACTION>Cleopatra swoons.</ACTION> 

IRAS She’s dead, too, our sovereign.	 

CHARMIAN Lady! 

IRAS Madam! 

CHARMIAN O madam, madam, madam! 

IRAS Royal Egypt! Empress!	 

<ACTION>Cleopatra stirs.</ACTION> 

CHARMIAN  Peace, peace, Iras!	 

CLEOPATRA No more but e’en a woman, and commanded By such poor passion as the maid that milks And does the meanest chares. It were for me To throw my scepter at the injurious gods, To tell them that this world did equal theirs	 Till they had stolen our jewel. All’s but naught. Patience is sottish, and impatience does Become a dog that’s mad. Then is it sin To rush into the secret house of death Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?	 What, what, good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian? My noble girls! Ah, women, women! Look, Our lamp is spent; it’s out. Good sirs, take heart. We’ll bury him; and then, what’s brave, what’s noble,	 Let’s do ’t after the high Roman fashion And make death proud to take us. Come, away. This case of that huge spirit now is cold. Ah women, women! Come, we have no friend But resolution and the briefest end.	 

<ACTION>They exit, bearing off Antony’s body.</ACTION>
