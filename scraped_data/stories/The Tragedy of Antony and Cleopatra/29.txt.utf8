<ACTION>Trumpets sound. Enter Antony and Eros, and a Soldierwho meets them.</ACTION> 

SOLDIER The gods make this a happy day to Antony. 

ANTONY Would thou and those thy scars had once prevailed To make me fight at land. 

SOLDIER Had’st thou done so, The kings that have revolted and the soldier	 That has this morning left thee would have still Followed thy heels. 

ANTONY Who’s gone this morning? 

SOLDIER Who? One ever near thee. Call for Enobarbus,	 He shall not hear thee, or from Caesar’s camp Say “I am none of thine.” 

ANTONY What sayest thou? 

SOLDIER Sir, He is with Caesar.	 

EROS Sir, his chests and treasure He has not with him. 

ANTONY  Is he gone? 

SOLDIER Most certain. 

ANTONY Go, Eros, send his treasure after. Do it.	 Detain no jot, I charge thee. Write to him— I will subscribe—gentle adieus and greetings. Say that I wish he never find more cause To change a master. O, my fortunes have Corrupted honest men. Dispatch.—Enobarbus!	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
