<ACTION>Enter Tullus Aufidius bloody, with two or three Soldiers.</ACTION> 

AUFIDIUS The town is ta’en. 

SOLDIER ’Twill be delivered back on good condition. 

AUFIDIUS Condition? I would I were a Roman, for I cannot, Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition?	 What good condition can a treaty find I’ th’ part that is at mercy? Five times, Martius, I have fought with thee; so often hast thou beat me And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter As often as we eat. By th’ elements,	 

If e’er again I meet him beard to beard, He’s mine, or I am his. Mine emulation Hath not that honor in ’t it had; for where I thought to crush him in an equal force, True sword to sword, I’ll potch at him some way	 Or wrath or craft may get him. 

SOLDIER He’s the devil. 

AUFIDIUS Bolder, though not so subtle. My valor’s poisoned With only suff’ring stain by him; for him Shall fly out of itself. Nor sleep nor sanctuary,	 Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol, The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice, Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up Their rotten privilege and custom ’gainst My hate to Martius. Where I find him, were it	 At home, upon my brother’s guard, even there, Against the hospitable canon, would I Wash my fierce hand in ’s heart. Go you to th’ city; Learn how ’tis held and what they are that must Be hostages for Rome.	 

SOLDIER Will not you go? 

AUFIDIUS I am attended at the cypress grove. I pray you— ’Tis south the city mills—bring me word thither How the world goes, that to the pace of it I may spur on my journey.	 

SOLDIER I shall, sir. 

<ACTION>They exit, Aufidius through one door,Soldiers through another.</ACTION>
