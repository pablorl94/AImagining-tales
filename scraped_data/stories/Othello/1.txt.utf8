<ACTION>Enter Othello, Iago, Attendants, with Torches.</ACTION> 

IAGO Though in the trade of war I have slain men, Yet do I hold it very stuff o’ th’ conscience To do no contrived murder. I lack iniquity Sometimes to do me service. Nine or ten times I had thought t’ have yerked him here under the	 ribs. 

OTHELLO ’Tis better as it is. 

IAGO Nay, but he prated And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms Against your Honor,	 That with the little godliness I have I did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir, Are you fast married? Be assured of this, That the magnifico is much beloved, And hath in his effect a voice potential	 As double as the Duke’s. He will divorce you Or put upon you what restraint or grievance The law (with all his might to enforce it on) Will give him cable. 

OTHELLO Let him do his spite.	 My services which I have done the signiory Shall out-tongue his complaints. ’Tis yet to know (Which, when I know that boasting is an honor, I shall promulgate) I fetch my life and being From men of royal siege, and my demerits	 May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune As this that I have reached. For know, Iago, But that I love the gentle Desdemona, I would not my unhousèd free condition Put into circumscription and confine	 For the sea’s worth. But look, what lights come yond? 

IAGO Those are the raisèd father and his friends. You were best go in. 

OTHELLO  Not I. I must be found.	 My parts, my title, and my perfect soul Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they? 

IAGO By Janus, I think no. 

<ACTION>Enter Cassio, with Officers, and Torches.</ACTION> 

OTHELLO The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant! The goodness of the night upon you, friends.	 What is the news? 

CASSIO The Duke does greet you, general, And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance, Even on the instant. 

OTHELLO What is the matter, think you?	 

CASSIO Something from Cyprus, as I may divine. It is a business of some heat. The galleys Have sent a dozen sequent messengers This very night at one another’s heels, And many of the Consuls, raised and met,	 Are at the Duke’s already. You have been hotly called for. When, being not at your lodging to be found, The Senate hath sent about three several quests To search you out.	 

OTHELLO ’Tis well I am found by you. I will but spend a word here in the house And go with you.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

CASSIO Ancient, what makes he here? 

IAGO Faith, he tonight hath boarded a land carrack.	 If it prove lawful prize, he’s made forever. 

CASSIO I do not understand. 

IAGO  He’s married. 

CASSIO  To who? 

IAGO Marry, to—	 

<ACTION>Reenter Othello.</ACTION> 

Come, captain, will you go? 

OTHELLO Have with you. 

CASSIO Here comes another troop to seek for you. 

<ACTION>Enter Brabantio, Roderigo, with Officers, and Torches.</ACTION> 

IAGO It is Brabantio. General, be advised, He comes to bad intent.	 

OTHELLO Holla, stand there! 

RODERIGO Signior, it is the Moor. 

BRABANTIO Down with him, thief! 

<ACTION>They draw their swords.</ACTION> 

IAGO You, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.	 

OTHELLO Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them. Good signior, you shall more command with years Than with your weapons. 

BRABANTIO O, thou foul thief, where hast thou stowed my	 daughter? Damned as thou art, thou hast enchanted her! For I’ll refer me to all things of sense, If she in chains of magic were not bound, Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,	 So opposite to marriage that she shunned The wealthy curlèd darlings of our nation, Would ever have, t’ incur a general mock, Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom Of such a thing as thou—to fear, not to delight!	 Judge me the world, if ’tis not gross in sense That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms, Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals That weakens motion. I’ll have ’t disputed on. ’Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.	 I therefore apprehend and do attach thee For an abuser of the world, a practicer Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.— Lay hold upon him. If he do resist, Subdue him at his peril.	 

OTHELLO Hold your hands, Both you of my inclining and the rest. Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it Without a prompter.—Whither will you that I go To answer this your charge?	 

BRABANTIO To prison, till fit time Of law and course of direct session Call thee to answer. 

OTHELLO  What if I do obey? How may the Duke be therewith satisfied,	 Whose messengers are here about my side, Upon some present business of the state, To bring me to him? 

OFFICER ’Tis true, most worthy signior. The Duke’s in council, and your noble self	 I am sure is sent for. 

BRABANTIO How? The Duke in council? In this time of the night? Bring him away; Mine’s not an idle cause. The Duke himself, Or any of my brothers of the state,	 Cannot but feel this wrong as ’twere their own. For if such actions may have passage free, Bondslaves and pagans shall our statesmen be. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
