Chapter 2.XXV. 

--'Because,' quoth my great grandmother, repeating the words again--'you have little or no nose, Sir.'-- 

S'death! cried my great-grandfather, clapping his hand upon his nose,--'tis not so small as that comes to;--'tis a full inch longer than my father's.--Now, my great-grandfather's nose was for all the world like unto the noses of all the men, women, and children, whom Pantagruel found dwelling upon the island of Ennasin.--By the way, if you would know the strange way of getting a-kin amongst so flat-nosed a people--you must read the book;--find it out yourself, you never can.-- 

--'Twas shaped, Sir, like an ace of clubs. 

--'Tis a full inch, continued my grandfather, pressing up the ridge of his nose with his finger and thumb; and repeating his assertion--'tis a full inch longer, madam, than my father's--You must mean your uncle's, replied my great-grandmother. 

--My great-grandfather was convinced.--He untwisted the paper, and signed the article.
