<ACTION>Enter Feste, the Fool and Fabian.</ACTION> 

FABIAN Now, as thou lov’st me, let me see his letter. 

FOOL Good Master Fabian, grant me another request. 

FABIAN Anything. 

FOOL Do not desire to see this letter. 

FABIAN This is to give a dog and in recompense desire my dog again. 

<ACTION>Enter Orsino, Viola, Curio, and Lords.</ACTION> 

ORSINO Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends? 

FOOL Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings. 

ORSINO I know thee well. How dost thou, my good fellow? 

FOOL Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse	 for my friends. 

ORSINO Just the contrary: the better for thy friends. 

FOOL No, sir, the worse. 

ORSINO How can that be? 

FOOL Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me.	 Now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass; so that by my foes, sir, I profit in the knowledge of myself, and by my friends I am abused. So that, conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives make your two affirmatives, why then the worse for my friends and	 the better for my foes. 

ORSINO Why, this is excellent. 

FOOL By my troth, sir, no—though it please you to be one of my friends. 

ORSINO ,  <ACTION>giving a coin</ACTION> Thou shalt not be the worse for me; there’s gold.	 

FOOL  But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would you could make it another. 

ORSINO O, you give me ill counsel. 

FOOL Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once, and let your flesh and blood obey it.	 

ORSINO Well, I will be so much a sinner to be a double-dealer: there’s another.	 <ACTION>He gives a coin.</ACTION> 

FOOL Primo, secundo, tertio is a good play, and the old saying is, the third pays for all. The triplex, sir, is a good tripping measure, or the bells of Saint Bennet,	 sir, may put you in mind—one, two, three. 

ORSINO You can fool no more money out of me at this throw. If you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake my bounty further.	 

FOOL Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come again. I go, sir, but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness. But, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap. I will awake it anon.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Antonio and Officers.</ACTION> 

VIOLA Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me. 

ORSINO That face of his I do remember well. Yet when I saw it last, it was besmeared As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war. A baubling vessel was he captain of,	 For shallow draught and bulk unprizable, With which such scatheful grapple did he make With the most noble bottom of our fleet That very envy and the tongue of loss Cried fame and honor on him.—What’s the matter?	 

FIRST OFFICER Orsino, this is that Antonio That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy, And this is he that did the Tiger board When your young nephew Titus lost his leg. Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,	 In private brabble did we apprehend him. 

VIOLA He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side, But in conclusion put strange speech upon me. I know not what ’twas but distraction. 

ORSINO Notable pirate, thou saltwater thief,	 What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear, Hast made thine enemies? 

ANTONIO Orsino, noble sir, Be pleased that I shake off these names you give	 me. Antonio never yet was thief or pirate, Though, I confess, on base and ground enough, Orsino’s enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither. That most ingrateful boy there by your side	 From the rude sea’s enraged and foamy mouth Did I redeem; a wrack past hope he was. His life I gave him and did thereto add My love, without retention or restraint, All his in dedication. For his sake	 Did I expose myself, pure for his love, Into the danger of this adverse town; Drew to defend him when he was beset; Where, being apprehended, his false cunning (Not meaning to partake with me in danger)	 Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance And grew a twenty years’ removèd thing While one would wink; denied me mine own purse, Which I had recommended to his use Not half an hour before.	 

VIOLA How can this be? 

ORSINO ,  <ACTION>to Antonio</ACTION> When came he to this town? 

ANTONIO Today, my lord; and for three months before, No int’rim, not a minute’s vacancy, Both day and night did we keep company.	 

<ACTION>Enter Olivia and Attendants.</ACTION> 

ORSINO Here comes the Countess. Now heaven walks on Earth!— But for thee, fellow: fellow, thy words are madness. Three months this youth hath tended upon me— But more of that anon.  <ACTION>To an Officer.</ACTION> Take him	 aside. 

OLIVIA What would my lord, but that he may not have, Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?— Cesario, you do not keep promise with me. 

VIOLA Madam?	 

ORSINO Gracious Olivia— 

OLIVIA What do you say, Cesario?—Good my lord— 

VIOLA My lord would speak; my duty hushes me. 

OLIVIA If it be aught to the old tune, my lord, It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear	 As howling after music. 

ORSINO Still so cruel? 

OLIVIA Still so constant, lord. 

ORSINO What, to perverseness? You, uncivil lady, To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars	 My soul the faithful’st off’rings have breathed out That e’er devotion tendered—what shall I do? 

OLIVIA Even what it please my lord that shall become him. 

ORSINO Why should I not, had I the heart to do it, Like to th’ Egyptian thief at point of death,	 Kill what I love?—a savage jealousy That sometime savors nobly. But hear me this: Since you to nonregardance cast my faith, And that I partly know the instrument That screws me from my true place in your favor,	 Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still. But this your minion, whom I know you love, And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly, Him will I tear out of that cruel eye Where he sits crownèd in his master’s spite.—	 Come, boy, with me. My thoughts are ripe in mischief. I’ll sacrifice the lamb that I do love To spite a raven’s heart within a dove. 

VIOLA And I, most jocund, apt, and willingly,	 To do you rest a thousand deaths would die. 

OLIVIA Where goes Cesario? 

VIOLA  After him I love More than I love these eyes, more than my life, More by all mores than e’er I shall love wife.	 If I do feign, you witnesses above, Punish my life for tainting of my love. 

OLIVIA Ay me, detested! How am I beguiled! 

VIOLA Who does beguile you? Who does do you wrong? 

OLIVIA Hast thou forgot thyself? Is it so long?—	 Call forth the holy father.	 

<ACTION>An Attendant exits.</ACTION> 

ORSINO ,  <ACTION>to Viola</ACTION> Come, away! 

OLIVIA Whither, my lord?—Cesario, husband, stay. 

ORSINO Husband? 

OLIVIA Ay, husband. Can he that deny?	 

ORSINO Her husband, sirrah? 

VIOLA No, my lord, not I. 

OLIVIA Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety. Fear not, Cesario. Take thy fortunes up.	 Be that thou know’st thou art, and then thou art As great as that thou fear’st. 

<ACTION>Enter Priest.</ACTION> 

O, welcome, father. Father, I charge thee by thy reverence Here to unfold (though lately we intended	 To keep in darkness what occasion now Reveals before ’tis ripe) what thou dost know Hath newly passed between this youth and me. 

PRIEST A contract of eternal bond of love, Confirmed by mutual joinder of your hands,	 Attested by the holy close of lips, Strengthened by interchangement of your rings, And all the ceremony of this compact Sealed in my function, by my testimony; Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my	 grave I have traveled but two hours. 

ORSINO ,  <ACTION>to Viola</ACTION> O thou dissembling cub! What wilt thou be When time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case? Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow	 That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow? Farewell, and take her, but direct thy feet Where thou and I henceforth may never meet. 

VIOLA My lord, I do protest— 

OLIVIA O, do not swear.	 Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear. 

<ACTION>Enter Sir Andrew.</ACTION> 

ANDREW For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently to Sir Toby. 

OLIVIA What’s the matter? 

ANDREW Has broke my head across, and has given Sir	 Toby a bloody coxcomb too. For the love of God, your help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home. 

OLIVIA Who has done this, Sir Andrew? 

ANDREW The Count’s gentleman, one Cesario. We took	 him for a coward, but he’s the very devil incardinate. 

ORSINO My gentleman Cesario? 

ANDREW ’Od’s lifelings, here he is!—You broke my head for nothing, and that that I did, I was set on to	 do ’t by Sir Toby. 

VIOLA Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you. You drew your sword upon me without cause, But I bespake you fair and hurt you not. 

ANDREW If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt	 me. I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb. 

<ACTION>Enter Toby and Feste, the Fool.</ACTION> 

Here comes Sir Toby halting. You shall hear more. But if he had not been in drink, he would have tickled you othergates than he did. 

ORSINO How now, gentleman? How is ’t with you?	 

TOBY That’s all one. Has hurt me, and there’s th’ end on ’t.  <ACTION>To Fool.</ACTION> Sot, didst see Dick Surgeon, sot? 

FOOL O, he’s drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes were set at eight i’ th’ morning. 

TOBY Then he’s a rogue and a passy-measures pavin. I	 hate a drunken rogue. 

OLIVIA Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them? 

ANDREW I’ll help you, Sir Toby, because we’ll be dressed together.	 

TOBY Will you help?—an ass-head, and a coxcomb, and a knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull? 

OLIVIA Get him to bed, and let his hurt be looked to. 

<ACTION>Toby, Andrew, Fool, and Fabian exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Sebastian.</ACTION> 

SEBASTIAN I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman, But, had it been the brother of my blood,	 I must have done no less with wit and safety. You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that I do perceive it hath offended you. Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows We made each other but so late ago.	 

ORSINO One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons! A natural perspective, that is and is not! 

SEBASTIAN Antonio, O, my dear Antonio! How have the hours racked and tortured me Since I have lost thee!	 

ANTONIO Sebastian are you? 

SEBASTIAN Fear’st thou that, Antonio? 

ANTONIO How have you made division of yourself? An apple cleft in two is not more twin Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?	 

OLIVIA Most wonderful! 

SEBASTIAN ,  <ACTION>looking at Viola</ACTION> Do I stand there? I never had a brother, Nor can there be that deity in my nature Of here and everywhere. I had a sister Whom the blind waves and surges have devoured.	 Of charity, what kin are you to me? What countryman? What name? What parentage? 

VIOLA Of Messaline. Sebastian was my father. Such a Sebastian was my brother too. So went he suited to his watery tomb.	 If spirits can assume both form and suit, You come to fright us. 

SEBASTIAN A spirit I am indeed, But am in that dimension grossly clad Which from the womb I did participate. Were you a woman, as the rest goes even, I should my tears let fall upon your cheek And say “Thrice welcome, drownèd Viola.” 

VIOLA My father had a mole upon his brow. 

SEBASTIAN And so had mine.	 

VIOLA And died that day when Viola from her birth Had numbered thirteen years. 

SEBASTIAN O, that record is lively in my soul! He finishèd indeed his mortal act That day that made my sister thirteen years.	 

VIOLA If nothing lets to make us happy both But this my masculine usurped attire, Do not embrace me till each circumstance Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump That I am Viola; which to confirm,	 I’ll bring you to a captain in this town, Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help I was preserved to serve this noble count. All the occurrence of my fortune since Hath been between this lady and this lord.	 

SEBASTIAN ,  <ACTION>to Olivia</ACTION> So comes it, lady, you have been mistook. But nature to her bias drew in that. You would have been contracted to a maid. Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived: You are betrothed both to a maid and man.	 

ORSINO ,  <ACTION>to Olivia</ACTION> Be not amazed; right noble is his blood. If this be so, as yet the glass seems true, I shall have share in this most happy wrack.— Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.	 

VIOLA And all those sayings will I overswear, And all those swearings keep as true in soul As doth that orbèd continent the fire That severs day from night. 

ORSINO Give me thy hand,	 And let me see thee in thy woman’s weeds. 

VIOLA The Captain that did bring me first on shore Hath my maid’s garments. He, upon some action, Is now in durance at Malvolio’s suit, A gentleman and follower of my lady’s.	 

OLIVIA He shall enlarge him. 

<ACTION>Enter Feste, the Fool with a letter, and Fabian.</ACTION> 

Fetch Malvolio hither. And yet, alas, now I remember me, They say, poor gentleman, he’s much distract. A most extracting frenzy of mine own	 From my remembrance clearly banished his. <ACTION>To the Fool.</ACTION> How does he, sirrah? 

FOOL Truly, madam, he holds Beelzebub at the stave’s end as well as a man in his case may do. Has here writ a letter to you. I should have given ’t you today	 morning. But as a madman’s epistles are no gospels, so it skills not much when they are delivered. 

OLIVIA Open ’t and read it. 

FOOL Look then to be well edified, when the Fool delivers the madman.  <ACTION>He reads.</ACTION> By the Lord,	 madam— 

OLIVIA How now, art thou mad? 

FOOL No, madam, I do but read madness. An your Ladyship will have it as it ought to be, you must allow vox.	 

OLIVIA Prithee, read i’ thy right wits. 

FOOL  So I do, madonna. But to read his right wits is to read thus. Therefore, perpend, my princess, and give ear. 

OLIVIA ,  <ACTION>giving letter to Fabian</ACTION> Read it you, sirrah.  	 

FABIAN <ACTION>(reads)</ACTION> "By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the world shall know it. Though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your Ladyship. I have your own letter that induced me to	 the semblance I put on, with the which I doubt not but to do myself much right or you much shame. Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury. The madly used Malvolio."   

OLIVIA Did he write this? 

FOOL  Ay, madam. 

ORSINO This savors not much of distraction. 

OLIVIA See him delivered, Fabian. Bring him hither. 

<ACTION>Fabian exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>To Orsino.</ACTION> My lord, so please you, these things	 further thought on, To think me as well a sister as a wife, One day shall crown th’ alliance on ’t, so please you, Here at my house, and at my proper cost.	 

ORSINO Madam, I am most apt t’ embrace your offer. <ACTION>To Viola.</ACTION> Your master quits you; and for your service done him, So much against the mettle of your sex, So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,	 And since you called me “master” for so long, Here is my hand. You shall from this time be Your master’s mistress. 

OLIVIA , <ACTION> to Viola</ACTION> A sister! You are she. 

<ACTION>Enter Malvolio and Fabian.</ACTION> 

ORSINO Is this the madman?	 

OLIVIA Ay, my lord, this same.— How now, Malvolio? 

MALVOLIO  Madam, you have done me wrong, Notorious wrong.	 

OLIVIA Have I, Malvolio? No. 

MALVOLIO ,  <ACTION>handing her a paper</ACTION> Lady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter. You must not now deny it is your hand. Write from it if you can, in hand or phrase, Or say ’tis not your seal, not your invention.	 You can say none of this. Well, grant it then, And tell me, in the modesty of honor, Why you have given me such clear lights of favor? Bade me come smiling and cross-gartered to you, To put on yellow stockings, and to frown	 Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people? And, acting this in an obedient hope, Why have you suffered me to be imprisoned, Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest, And made the most notorious geck and gull	 That e’er invention played on? Tell me why. 

OLIVIA Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing, Though I confess much like the character. But out of question, ’tis Maria’s hand. And now I do bethink me, it was she	 First told me thou wast mad; then cam’st in smiling, And in such forms which here were presupposed Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content. This practice hath most shrewdly passed upon thee. But when we know the grounds and authors of it,	 Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge Of thine own cause. 

FABIAN Good madam, hear me speak, And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come Taint the condition of this present hour,	 Which I have wondered at. In hope it shall not, Most freely I confess, myself and Toby Set this device against Malvolio here, Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts We had conceived against him. Maria writ	 The letter at Sir Toby’s great importance, In recompense whereof he hath married her. How with a sportful malice it was followed May rather pluck on laughter than revenge, If that the injuries be justly weighed	 That have on both sides passed. 

OLIVIA ,  <ACTION>to Malvolio</ACTION> Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee! 

FOOL Why, “some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrown upon them.” I was one, sir, in this interlude, one Sir Topas, sir,	 but that’s all one. “By the Lord, Fool, I am not mad”—but, do you remember “Madam, why laugh you at such a barren rascal; an you smile not, he’s gagged”? And thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.	 

MALVOLIO I’ll be revenged on the whole pack of you! 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

OLIVIA He hath been most notoriously abused. 

ORSINO Pursue him and entreat him to a peace.	 <ACTION>Some exit.</ACTION> He hath not told us of the Captain yet. When that is known, and golden time convents,	 A solemn combination shall be made Of our dear souls.—Meantime, sweet sister, We will not part from hence.—Cesario, come, For so you shall be while you are a man. But when in other habits you are seen,	 Orsino’s mistress, and his fancy’s queen. 

<ACTION>All but the Fool exit.</ACTION> 

FOOL <ACTION>sings</ACTION> "When that I was and a little tiny boy, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, A foolish thing was but a toy, For the rain it raineth every day.	 

"But when I came to man’s estate, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, ’Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate, For the rain it raineth every day. 

"But when I came, alas, to wive,	 With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, By swaggering could I never thrive, For the rain it raineth every day. 

"But when I came unto my beds, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,	 With tosspots still had drunken heads, For the rain it raineth every day. 

"A great while ago the world begun, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, But that’s all one, our play is done,	 And we’ll strive to please you every day." 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
