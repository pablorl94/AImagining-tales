MISTRESS PAGE Is he at Master Ford’s already, think’st thou? 

MISTRESS QUICKLY Sure he is by this, or will be presently. But truly he is very courageous mad about his throwing into the water. Mistress Ford desires	 you to come suddenly. 

MISTRESS PAGE I’ll be with her by and by. I’ll but bring my young man here to school. 

<ACTION>Enter Sir Hugh Evans.</ACTION> 

Look where his master comes. ’Tis a playing day, I see.—How now, Sir Hugh, no school today?	 

SIR HUGH No. Master Slender is let the boys leave to play. 

MISTRESS QUICKLY Blessing of his heart! 

MISTRESS PAGE  Sir Hugh, my husband says my son profits nothing in the world at his book. I pray you,	 ask him some questions in his accidence. 

SIR HUGH  Come hither, William. Hold up your head. Come. 

MISTRESS PAGE Come on, sirrah. Hold up your head. Answer your master. Be not afraid.	 

SIR HUGH  William, how many numbers is in nouns? 

WILLIAM Two. 

MISTRESS QUICKLY Truly, I thought there had been one number more, because they say “ ’Od’s nouns.” 

SIR HUGH Peace your tattlings!—What is “fair,”	 William? 

WILLIAM Pulcher. 

MISTRESS QUICKLY Polecats? There are fairer things than polecats, sure. 

SIR HUGH You are a very simplicity ’oman. I pray you,	 peace.—What is lapis, William? 

WILLIAM A stone. 

SIR HUGH And what is “a stone,” William? 

WILLIAM  A pebble. 

SIR HUGH  No. It is lapis. I pray you, remember in your	 prain. 

WILLIAM Lapis. 

SIR HUGH  That is a good William. What is he, William, that does lend articles? 

WILLIAM  Articles are borrowed of the pronoun and be	 thus declined: singulariter, nominativo, hic, haec, hoc. 

SIR HUGH  Nominativo, hig, haeg, hog. Pray you, mark: genitivo, huius. Well, what is your accusative case? 

WILLIAM Accusativo, hinc.	 

SIR HUGH I pray you, have your remembrance, child. Accusativo, hung, hang, hog. 

MISTRESS QUICKLY “Hang-hog” is Latin for bacon, I warrant you. 

SIR HUGH Leave your prabbles, ’oman.—What is the	 focative case, William? 

WILLIAM O—vocativo—O— 

SIR HUGH Remember, William, focative is caret. 

MISTRESS QUICKLY And that’s a good root. 

SIR HUGH ’Oman, forbear.

WILLIAM  Genitive: horum, harum, horum.	 

MISTRESS QUICKLY Vengeance of Ginny’s case! Fie on her! Never name her, child, if she be a whore. 

SIR HUGH For shame, ’oman! 

MISTRESS QUICKLY You do ill to teach the child such words.—He teaches him to hick and to hack,	 which they’ll do fast enough of themselves, and to call “whorum.”—Fie upon you! 

SIR HUGH ’Oman, art thou lunatics? Hast thou no understandings for thy cases and the numbers of the genders? Thou art as foolish Christian creatures as	 I would desires. 

MISTRESS PAGE , <ACTION> to Mistress Quickly</ACTION> Prithee, hold thy peace. 

SIR HUGH Show me now, William, some declensions of your pronouns.	 

WILLIAM Forsooth, I have forgot. 

SIR HUGH It is qui, quae, quod. If you forget your qui’s, your quae’s, and your quod’s, you must be preeches. Go your ways and play, go. 

MISTRESS PAGE  He is a better scholar than I thought he	 was. 

SIR HUGH He is a good sprag memory. Farewell, Mistress Page.
