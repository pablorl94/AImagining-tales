<ACTION>Enter Host and Simple.</ACTION> 

HOST What wouldst thou have, boor? What, thickskin? Speak, breathe, discuss; brief, short, quick, snap. 

SIMPLE Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff from Master Slender.	 

HOST There’s his chamber, his house, his castle, his standing-bed and truckle-bed. ’Tis painted about with the story of the Prodigal, fresh and new. Go, knock and call. He’ll speak like an Anthropophaginian unto thee. Knock, I say.	 

SIMPLE There’s an old woman, a fat woman, gone up into his chamber. I’ll be so bold as stay, sir, till she come down. I come to speak with her, indeed. 

HOST Ha? A fat woman? The knight may be robbed. I’ll call.—Bully knight! Bully Sir John! Speak from	 thy lungs military. Art thou there? It is thine Host, thine Ephesian, calls. 

FALSTAFF ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> How now, mine Host? 

HOST Here’s a Bohemian Tartar tarries the coming down of thy fat woman. Let her descend, bully, let	 her descend. My chambers are honorable. Fie! Privacy? Fie! 

<ACTION>Enter Sir John Falstaff.</ACTION> 

FALSTAFF There was, mine Host, an old fat woman even now with me, but she’s gone. 

SIMPLE Pray you, sir, was ’t not the wise woman of	 Brentford? 

FALSTAFF Ay, marry, was it, mussel-shell. What would you with her? 

SIMPLE My master, sir, my Master Slender, sent to her, seeing her go through the streets, to know, sir,	 whether one Nym, sir, that beguiled him of a chain, had the chain or no. 

FALSTAFF I spake with the old woman about it. 

SIMPLE  And what says she, I pray, sir? 

FALSTAFF Marry, she says that the very same man that	 beguiled Master Slender of his chain cozened him of it. 

SIMPLE I would I could have spoken with the woman herself. I had other things to have spoken with her too from him.	 

FALSTAFF  What are they? Let us know. 

HOST Ay, come. Quick! 

SIMPLE I may not conceal them, sir. 

HOST Conceal them, or thou diest. 

SIMPLE Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress	 Anne Page, to know if it were my master’s fortune to have her or no. 

FALSTAFF ’Tis; ’tis his fortune. 

SIMPLE What, sir? 

FALSTAFF To have her or no. Go. Say the woman told	 me so. 

SIMPLE May I be bold to say so, sir? 

FALSTAFF  Ay, sir; like who more bold. 

SIMPLE I thank your Worship. I shall make my master glad with these tidings.  

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

HOST Thou art clerkly, thou art clerkly, Sir John. Was there a wise woman with thee? 

FALSTAFF Ay, that there was, mine Host, one that hath taught me more wit than ever I learned before in my life. And I paid nothing for it neither, but was	 paid for my learning. 

<ACTION>Enter Bardolph.</ACTION> 

BARDOLPH , <ACTION> to Host</ACTION> Out, alas, sir, cozenage, mere cozenage! 

HOST Where be my horses? Speak well of them, varletto.	 

BARDOLPH  Run away with the cozeners. For so soon as I came beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind one of them in a slough of mire, and set spurs, and away, like three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.	 

HOST They are gone but to meet the Duke, villain. Do not say they be fled. Germans are honest men. 

<ACTION>Enter Sir Hugh Evans.</ACTION> 

SIR HUGH  Where is mine Host? 

HOST  What is the matter, sir? 

SIR HUGH Have a care of your entertainments. There is	 a friend of mine come to town tells me there is three cozen-Germans that has cozened all the hosts of Readings, of Maidenhead, of Colnbrook, of horses and money. I tell you for good will, look you. You are wise, and full of gibes and vlouting-stocks,	 and ’tis not convenient you should be cozened. Fare you well.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Doctor Caius.</ACTION> 

DOCTOR CAIUS Vere is mine Host de Jarteer? 

HOST Here, Master Doctor, in perplexity and doubtful dilemma.	 

DOCTOR CAIUS I cannot tell vat is dat. But it is tell-a me dat you make grand preparation for a duke de Jamanie. By my trot, dere is no duke that the court is know to come. I tell you for good will. Adieu. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

HOST , <ACTION> to Bardolph</ACTION> Hue and cry, villain, go!—Assist	 me, knight. I am undone.—Fly, run; hue and cry, villain! I am undone.	 

<ACTION>Host and Bardolph exit.</ACTION> 

FALSTAFF I would all the world might be cozened, for I have been cozened and beaten too. If it should come to the ear of the court how I have been transformed,	 and how my transformation hath been washed and cudgeled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by drop, and liquor fishermen’s boots with me. I warrant they would whip me with their fine wits till I were as crestfallen as a dried pear. I	 never prospered since I forswore myself at primero. Well, if my wind were but long enough, I would repent. 

<ACTION>Enter Mistress Quickly.</ACTION> 

Now, whence come you? 

MISTRESS QUICKLY From the two parties, forsooth.	 

FALSTAFF The devil take one party, and his dam the other, and so they shall be both bestowed. I have suffered more for their sakes, more than the villainous inconstancy of man’s disposition is able to bear.	 

MISTRESS QUICKLY And have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant, speciously one of them. Mistress Ford, good heart, is beaten black and blue that you cannot see a white spot about her. 

FALSTAFF  What tell’st thou me of black and blue? I was	 beaten myself into all the colors of the rainbow, and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of Brentford. But that my admirable dexterity of wit, my counterfeiting the action of an old woman, delivered me, the knave constable had set me i’ th’	 stocks, i’ th’ common stocks, for a witch. 

MISTRESS QUICKLY  Sir, let me speak with you in your chamber. You shall hear how things go, and, I warrant, to your content. Here is a letter will say somewhat.  <ACTION>She gives him a paper.</ACTION> Good hearts,	 what ado here is to bring you together! Sure, one of you does not serve heaven well, that you are so crossed. 

FALSTAFF Come up into my chamber. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
