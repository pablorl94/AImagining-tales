<ACTION>Enter Lord Scales upon the Tower, walking. Then enterstwo or three Citizens below.</ACTION> 

SCALES   How now? Is Jack Cade slain? 

FIRST CITIZEN  No, my lord, nor likely to be slain; for they have won the Bridge, killing all those that withstand them. The Lord Mayor craves aid of your Honor from the Tower to defend the city from the rebels. 

SCALES Such aid as I can spare you shall command; But I am troubled here with them myself: The rebels have essayed to win the Tower. But get you to Smithfield and gather head,	 And thither I will send you Matthew Gough. Fight for your king, your country, and your lives. And so farewell, for I must hence again. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
