<ACTION>Enter the King of France, the Dauphin, the Duke ofBrittany, the Constable of France, and others.</ACTION> 

KING OF FRANCE ’Tis certain he hath passed the river Somme. 

CONSTABLE An if he be not fought withal, my lord, Let us not live in France. Let us quit all, And give our vineyards to a barbarous people. 

DAUPHIN Ô Dieu vivant, shall a few sprays of us,	 The emptying of our fathers’ luxury, Our scions, put in wild and savage stock, Spurt up so suddenly into the clouds And overlook their grafters? 

BRITTANY Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards!	 Mort de ma vie, if they march along Unfought withal, but I will sell my dukedom To buy a slobb’ry and a dirty farm In that nook-shotten isle of Albion. 

CONSTABLE Dieu de batailles, where have they this mettle?	 Is not their climate foggy, raw, and dull, On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale, Killing their fruit with frowns? Can sodden water, A drench for sur-reined jades, their barley broth, Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?	 And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine, Seem frosty? O, for honor of our land, Let us not hang like roping icicles Upon our houses’ thatch, whiles a more frosty people	 Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields! “Poor” we may call them in their native lords. 

DAUPHIN By faith and honor, Our madams mock at us and plainly say Our mettle is bred out, and they will give	 Their bodies to the lust of English youth To new-store France with bastard warriors. 

BRITTANY They bid us to the English dancing-schools, And teach lavoltas high, and swift corantos, Saying our grace is only in our heels	 And that we are most lofty runaways. 

KING OF FRANCE Where is Montjoy the herald? Speed him hence. Let him greet England with our sharp defiance. Up, princes, and, with spirit of honor edged More sharper than your swords, hie to the field:	 Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France; You Dukes of Orléans, Bourbon, and of Berri, Alençon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy; Jacques Chatillon, Rambures, Vaudemont, Beaumont, Grandpré, Roussi, and Faulconbridge,	 Foix, Lestrale, Bouciquault, and Charolois; High dukes, great princes, barons, lords, and knights, For your great seats now quit you of great shames. Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land	 With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur. Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow Upon the valleys, whose low vassal seat The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon. Go down upon him—you have power enough—	 And in a captive chariot into Rouen Bring him our prisoner. 

CONSTABLE  This becomes the great! Sorry am I his numbers are so few, His soldiers sick and famished in their march,	 For, I am sure, when he shall see our army, He’ll drop his heart into the sink of fear And for achievement offer us his ransom. 

KING OF FRANCE Therefore, Lord Constable, haste on Montjoy, And let him say to England that we send	 To know what willing ransom he will give.— Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen. 

DAUPHIN Not so, I do beseech your Majesty. 

KING Be patient, for you shall remain with us.— Now forth, Lord Constable and princes all,	 And quickly bring us word of England’s fall. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
