<ACTION>Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Fabian.</ACTION> 

ANDREW No, faith, I’ll not stay a jot longer. 

TOBY Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason. 

FABIAN You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew. 

ANDREW Marry, I saw your niece do more favors to the Count’s servingman than ever she bestowed upon	 me. I saw ’t i’ th’ orchard. 

TOBY Did she see thee the while, old boy? Tell me that. 

ANDREW As plain as I see you now. 

FABIAN This was a great argument of love in her toward	 you. 

ANDREW ’Slight, will you make an ass o’ me? 

FABIAN I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment and reason. 

TOBY And they have been grand-jurymen since before	 Noah was a sailor. 

FABIAN She did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valor, to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver. You should then have accosted her, and	 with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should have banged the youth into dumbness. This was looked for at your hand, and this was balked. The double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off, and you are now sailed into the north	 of my lady’s opinion, where you will hang like an icicle on a Dutchman’s beard, unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valor or policy. 

ANDREW An ’t be any way, it must be with valor, for	 policy I hate. I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician. 

TOBY Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor. Challenge me the Count’s youth to fight with him. Hurt him in eleven places. My niece shall	 take note of it, and assure thyself there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man’s commendation with woman than report of valor. 

FABIAN There is no way but this, Sir Andrew. 

ANDREW Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?	 

TOBY Go, write it in a martial hand. Be curst and brief. It is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and full of invention. Taunt him with the license of ink. If thou “thou”-est him some thrice, it shall not be amiss, and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of	 paper, although the sheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England, set ’em down. Go, about it. Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou write with a goose-pen, no matter. About it. 

ANDREW Where shall I find you?	 

TOBY We’ll call thee at the cubiculo. Go. 

<ACTION>Sir Andrew exits.</ACTION> 

FABIAN This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby. 

TOBY I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand strong or so. 

FABIAN We shall have a rare letter from him. But you’ll	 not deliver ’t? 

TOBY Never trust me, then. And by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were opened and you find so much blood in his liver as	 will clog the foot of a flea, I’ll eat the rest of th’ anatomy. 

FABIAN  And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty. 

<ACTION>Enter Maria.</ACTION> 

TOBY Look where the youngest wren of mine comes.	 

MARIA If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselves into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no Christian that means to be saved by believing rightly can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness.	 He’s in yellow stockings. 

TOBY And cross-gartered? 

MARIA Most villainously, like a pedant that keeps a school i’ th’ church. I have dogged him like his murderer. He does obey every point of the letter	 that I dropped to betray him. He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies. You have not seen such a thing as ’tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things at him. I know my lady will strike him. If she do, he’ll	 smile and take ’t for a great favor. 

TOBY Come, bring us, bring us where he is. 

<ACTION>They all exit.</ACTION>
