Chapter 4.IV. 

We are ruin'd and undone, my child, said the abbess to Margarita,--we shall be here all night--we shall be plunder'd--we shall be ravished-- 

--We shall be ravish'd, said Margarita, as sure as a gun. 

Sancta Maria! cried the abbess (forgetting the O!)--why was I govern'd by this wicked stiff joint? why did I leave the convent of Andouillets? and why didst thou not suffer thy servant to go unpolluted to her tomb? 

O my finger! my finger! cried the novice, catching fire at the word servant--why was I not content to put it here, or there, any where rather than be in this strait? 

Strait! said the abbess. 

Strait--said the novice; for terror had struck their understandings--the one knew not what she said--the other what she answer'd. 

O my virginity! virginity! cried the abbess. 

...inity!...inity! said the novice, sobbing.
