[ACT III.  SCENE 1.] 

[The Portuguese court.] 

Enter VICEROY OF PORTINGALE, NOBLES, ALEXANDRO, VILLUPPO. 

VICEROY.  Infortunate condition of kings, Seated amidst so many helples doubts! First,we are plast vpon extreamest height, And oft supplanted with exceeding hate, But euer subiect to the wheele of chance; And at our highest neuer ioy we so As we doubt and dread our ouerthrow. So striueth not the waues with sundry winds As fortune toyleth in the affaires of kings, That would be feard, yet feare to be beloued, Sith feare and loue to kings is flatterie. For instance, lordings, look vpon your king, By hate depriued of his dearest sonne, The only hope of our successiue line. 

NOB.  I had not thought that Alexandros hart Had beene enuenomde with such extreame hate; But now I see that words haue seuerall workes, And theres no credit in the countenance. 

VIL.  No, for, my lord, had you beholde the traine That fained loue had coloured in his lookes When he in campe consorted Balthazar, Farre more inconstant had you thought the sunne, That howerly coasts the center of the earth, Then Alexandros purpose to the prince. 

VICE.  No more, Villuppo! thou hast said enough, And with thy words thou saiest our wounded thoughts. Nor shall I longer dally with the world, Procrastinating Alexandros death. Goe, some of you, and fetch the traitor forth, That, as he is condemned, he may dye. 

Enter ALEXANDRO, with a NOBLE-MAN and HALBERTS. 

NOB. In such extreames will nought but patience serue. 

ALEX.  But in extreames what patience shall I vse? Nor discontents it me to leaue the world, With whome there nothing can preuaile but wrong. 

NOB.  Yet hope the best. 

ALEX.                         Tis heauen my hope: As for the earth, it is too much infect To yeeld me hope of any of her mould. 

VICE.  Why linger ye? bring froth that daring feend, And let him die for his accursed deed. 

ALEX.  Not that I feare the extremitie of death-- For nobles cannot stoop to seruile feare-- Doo I, O king, thus discontented liue; But this, O this, torments my labouring soule, That thus I die suspected of a sinne Whereof, as Heauens haue knowne my secret thoughts, So am I free from this suggestion! 

VICE.  No more, I say; to the tortures!  when? Binde him, and burne his body in those flames, 

They binde him to the stake. 

That shall prefigure those vnquenched fiers Of Phlegiton prepared for his soule. 

ALEX.  My guiltles death will be aueng'd on thee! On thee, Villuppo, that hath malisde thus, Or for thy meed hast falsely me accusde! 

VIL.  Nay, Alexandro, if thou menace me, Ile lend a hand to send thee to the lake Where those thy words shall perish with thy workes, Iniurious traitour, monstrous homicide! 

Enter EMBASSADOUR. 

[EM.]  Stay!  hold a-while!  and heer, with pardon of His Maiestie, lay hands vpon Villuppo! 

VICE.  Embassadour, what newes nath vrg'd this sodain entrance? 

EM.  Know, soueraigne l[ord], that Balthazar doth liue. 

VICE.  What saiest thou?  liueth Balthazar, our sonne? 

EM.  Your Highnes sonne, L[ord] Balthazar doth liue, And, well intreated in the court of Spaine, Humbly commends him to your Maiestie. These eies beheld; and these my followers, With these, the letters of the kings commend, 

Giues him letters 

Are happie witnesses of his Highnes health. 

The KING lookes on the letters, and proceeds. 

VICE. [reads]  "Thy sonne doth liue; your tribute is receiu'd; Thy peace is made, and we are satisfied. The rest resolue vpon as things proposde For both our honors and they benefite." 

EM.  These are his Highnes farther articles. 

He giues him more letters. 

VICE.  Accursed wrech to intimate these ills Against the life and reputation Of noble Alexandro!  come, my lord, vnbinde him! [To ALEXANDRO]  Let him vnbinde thee that is bounde to death, To make a quitall for thy discontent. 

They vnbinde him. 

ALEX.  Dread lord, in kindnes you could do no lesse, Vpon report of such a damned fact; But thus we see our innocence hath sau'd The hopeles like which thou, Villuppo, sought By thy suggestions to haue massacred. 

VICE.  Say, false Villuppo, wherefore didst thou thus Falsely betray Lord Alexandros life? Him whom thou knowest that no vnkindenes els But euen the slaughter of our deerest sonne Could once haue moued vs to haue misconceaued. 

ALEX.  Say, trecherous Villuppo; tell the King! Or wherein hath Alexandro vsed thee ill? 

VIL.  Rent with remembrance of so foule a deed, My guiltie soule submits me to thy doome, For, not for Alexandros iniuries, But for reward and hope to be preferd, Thus haue I shamelesly hazarded his life. 

VICE.  Which, villaine, shalbe ransomed with thy death, And not so meane a torment as we heere Deuised for him who thou saidst slew our sonne, But with the bitterest torments and extreames That may be yet inuented for thine end. 

ALEX[ANDRO] seemes to intreat. 

Intreat me not!  Goe, take the traitor hence! 

Exit VILLUPPO. 

And, Alexandro, let vs honor thee With publique notice of thy loyaltie. To end those things articulated heere By our great l[ord], the mightie king of Spaine, We with our councell will deliberate. Come, Alexandro, keepe vs company. 

Exeunt.
