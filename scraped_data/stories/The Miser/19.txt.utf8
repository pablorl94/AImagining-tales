SCENE IV.--HARPAGON, CLÉANTE, VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES. 

HAR. And you, my young dandy of a son to whom I have the kindness of forgiving what happened this morning, mind you don't receive her coldly, or show her a sour face. 

CLE. Receive her coldly! And why should I? 

HAR. Why? why? We know pretty well the ways of children whose fathers marry again, and the looks they give to those we call stepmothers. But if you wish me to forget your last offence, I advise you, above all things, to receive her kindly, and, in short, to give her the heartiest welcome you can. 

CLE. To speak the truth, father, I cannot promise you that I am very happy to see her become my stepmother; but as to receiving her properly, and as to giving her a kind welcome, I promise to obey you in that to the very letter. 

HAR. Be careful you do, at least. 

CLE. You will see that you have no cause to complain. 

HAR. You will do wisely.
