Scene 2 

<ACTION>Enter Duke of York and the Duchess.</ACTION> 

DUCHESS My lord, you told me you would tell the rest, When weeping made you break the story off Of our two cousins coming into London. 

YORK Where did I leave? 

DUCHESS At that sad stop, my lord, Where rude misgoverned hands from windows’ tops Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard’s head. 

YORK Then, as I said, the Duke, great Bolingbroke, Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed, Which his aspiring rider seemed to know,	 With slow but stately pace kept on his course, Whilst all tongues cried “God save thee, Bolingbroke!” You would have thought the very windows spake, So many greedy looks of young and old	 Through casements darted their desiring eyes Upon his visage, and that all the walls With painted imagery had said at once “Jesu preserve thee! Welcome, Bolingbroke!” Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,	 Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed’s neck, Bespake them thus: “I thank you, countrymen.” And thus still doing, thus he passed along. 

DUCHESS Alack, poor Richard! Where rode he the whilst? 

YORK As in a theater the eyes of men,	 After a well-graced actor leaves the stage, Are idly bent on him that enters next, Thinking his prattle to be tedious, Even so, or with much more contempt, men’s eyes Did scowl on gentle Richard. No man cried “God	 save him!” No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home, But dust was thrown upon his sacred head, Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off, His face still combating with tears and smiles,	 The badges of his grief and patience, That had not God for some strong purpose steeled The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted, And barbarism itself have pitied him. But heaven hath a hand in these events,	 To whose high will we bound our calm contents. To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now, Whose state and honor I for aye allow. 

<ACTION>Enter Aumerle.</ACTION> 

DUCHESS Here comes my son Aumerle. 

YORK Aumerle that was;	 But that is lost for being Richard’s friend, And, madam, you must call him Rutland now. I am in parliament pledge for his truth And lasting fealty to the new-made king. 

DUCHESS Welcome, my son. Who are the violets now	 That strew the green lap of the new-come spring? 

AUMERLE Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not. God knows I had as lief be none as one. 

YORK Well, bear you well in this new spring of time, Lest you be cropped before you come to prime.	 What news from Oxford? Do these jousts and triumphs hold? 

AUMERLE For aught I know, my lord, they do. 

YORK You will be there, I know. 

AUMERLE If God prevent not, I purpose so.	 

YORK What seal is that that hangs without thy bosom? Yea, lookst thou pale? Let me see the writing. 

AUMERLE My lord, ’tis nothing. 

YORK No matter, then, who see it. I will be satisfied. Let me see the writing.	 

AUMERLE I do beseech your Grace to pardon me. It is a matter of small consequence, Which for some reasons I would not have seen. 

YORK Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see. I fear, I fear—	 

DUCHESS   What should you fear? ’Tis nothing but some bond that he is entered into For gay apparel ’gainst the triumph day. 

YORK Bound to himself? What doth he with a bond That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.—	 Boy, let me see the writing. 

AUMERLE I do beseech you, pardon me. I may not show it. 

YORK I will be satisfied. Let me see it, I say. He plucks it out of his bosom and reads it. 

YORK Treason! Foul treason! Villain, traitor, slave! 

DUCHESS   What is the matter, my lord?	 

YORK ,  <ACTION>calling offstage</ACTION> Ho, who is within there? Saddle my horse!— God for his mercy, what treachery is here! 

DUCHESS  Why, what is it, my lord? 

YORK ,  <ACTION>calling offstage</ACTION> Give me my boots, I say! Saddle my horse!— Now by mine honor, by my life, by my troth,	 I will appeach the villain. 

DUCHESS What is the matter? 

YORK Peace, foolish woman. 

DUCHESS I will not peace!—What is the matter, Aumerle? 

AUMERLE Good mother, be content. It is no more	 Than my poor life must answer. 

DUCHESS  Thy life answer? 

YORK ,  <ACTION>calling offstage</ACTION> Bring me my boots!—I will unto the King. 

<ACTION>His man enters with his boots.</ACTION> 

DUCHESS Strike him, Aumerle! Poor boy, thou art amazed.— Hence, villain, never more come in my sight.	 

YORK  Give me my boots, I say. 

<ACTION>His man helps him on with his boots, then exits.</ACTION> 

DUCHESS  Why, York, what wilt thou do? Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own? Have we more sons? Or are we like to have? Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?	 And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age And rob me of a happy mother’s name? Is he not like thee? Is he not thine own? 

YORK  Thou fond mad woman, Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?	 A dozen of them here have ta’en the sacrament And interchangeably set down their hands To kill the King at Oxford. 

DUCHESS He shall be none. We’ll keep him here. Then what is that to him?	 

YORK Away, fond woman! Were he twenty times my son, I would appeach him. 

DUCHESS Hadst thou groaned for him as I have done, Thou wouldst be more pitiful. But now I know thy mind: thou dost suspect	 That I have been disloyal to thy bed And that he is a bastard, not thy son. Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind! He is as like thee as a man may be, Not like to me or any of my kin,	 And yet I love him. 

YORK  Make way, unruly woman! 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

DUCHESS After, Aumerle! Mount thee upon his horse, Spur post, and get before him to the King, And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.	 I’ll not be long behind. Though I be old, I doubt not but to ride as fast as York. And never will I rise up from the ground Till Bolingbroke have pardoned thee. Away, begone! 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
