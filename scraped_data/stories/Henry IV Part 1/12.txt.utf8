<ACTION>Enter Falstaff and Bardolph.</ACTION> 

FALSTAFF Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry. Fill me a bottle of sack. Our soldiers shall march through. We’ll to Sutton Coldfield tonight. 

BARDOLPH  Will you give me money, captain? 

FALSTAFF Lay out, lay out.	 

BARDOLPH This bottle makes an angel. 

FALSTAFF An if it do, take it for thy labor. An if it make twenty, take them all. I’ll answer the coinage. Bid my lieutenant Peto meet me at town’s end. 

BARDOLPH  I will, captain. Farewell.	He exits.  

FALSTAFF  If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused gurnet. I have misused the King’s press damnably. I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me none but good householders, yeomen’s	 sons, inquire me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked twice on the banns—such a commodity of warm slaves as had as lief hear the devil as a drum, such as fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt wild duck. 

I pressed me	 none but such toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins’ heads, and they have bought out their services, and now my whole charge consists of ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of companies—slaves as ragged as Lazarus	 in the painted cloth, where the glutton’s dogs licked his sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but discarded, unjust servingmen, younger sons to younger brothers, revolted tapsters, and ostlers tradefallen, the cankers of a calm world and	 a long peace, ten times more dishonorable-ragged than an old feazed ancient; and such have I to fill up the rooms of them as have bought out their services, that you would think that I had a hundred and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from swine-keeping,	 from eating draff and husks.A mad fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye hath seen such scarecrows. I’ll not march through Coventry with them, that’s flat. Nay, and the villains	 march wide betwixt the legs as if they had gyves on, for indeed I had the most of them out of prison. 

There’s not a shirt and a half in all my company, and the half shirt is two napkins tacked together and thrown over the shoulders like a herald’s coat	 without sleeves; and the shirt, to say the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Albans or the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry.But that’s all one; they’ll find linen enough on every hedge. 

<ACTION>Enter the Prince and the Lord of Westmoreland.</ACTION> 

PRINCE How now, blown Jack? How now, quilt?	 

FALSTAFF What, Hal, how now, mad wag? What a devil dost thou in Warwickshire?—My good Lord of Westmoreland, I cry you mercy. I thought your Honor had already been at Shrewsbury. 

WESTMORELAND Faith, Sir John, ’tis more than time	 that I were there and you too, but my powers are there already. The King, I can tell you, looks for us all. We must away all night. 

FALSTAFF  Tut, never fear me. I am as vigilant as a cat to steal cream.	 

PRINCE I think to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose fellows are these that come after? 

FALSTAFF  Mine, Hal, mine. 

PRINCE I did never see such pitiful rascals.	 

FALSTAFF  Tut, tut, good enough to toss; food for powder, food for powder. They’ll fill a pit as well as better. Tush, man, mortal men, mortal men. 

WESTMORELAND  Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor and bare, too beggarly.	 

FALSTAFF Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had that, and for their bareness, I am sure they never learned that of me. 

PRINCE No, I’ll be sworn, unless you call three fingers in the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste. Percy is	 already in the field.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

FALSTAFF What, is the King encamped? 

WESTMORELAND He is, Sir John. I fear we shall stay too long.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

FALSTAFF Well,	 To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest. <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
