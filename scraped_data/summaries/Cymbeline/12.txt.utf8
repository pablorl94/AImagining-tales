Mail call: Pisanio reads a letter aloud to us from Posthumus. In it, his master accuses Imogen of adultery.

Pisanio can't believe it, but he follows his master's orders. He's supposed to deliver a letter to Imogen with instructions for her to leave the palace. Then he's supposed to murder her.

Yup. It just got real.

Well, Imogen walks right in. She's excited at the news that a letter has come from her husband. She reads that she is supposed to meet him in Cambria at Milford-Haven (in Wales). She can't believe it; she can't want to see him again.

Pisanio and Imogen decide that that Imogen will need to pretend she is sick. She'll retreat to her room so no one will notice she's gone.
