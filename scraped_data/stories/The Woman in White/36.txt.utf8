3.  THE NARRATIVE OF JANE GOULD 

I was the person sent in by Mr. Goodricke to do what was right and needful by the remains of a lady who had died at the house named in the certificate which precedes this.  I found the body in charge of the servant, Hester Pinhorn.  I remained with it, and prepared it at the proper time for the grave.  It was laid in the coffin in my presence, and I afterwards saw the coffin screwed down previous to its removal. When that had been done, and not before, I received what was due to me and left the house.  I refer persons who may wish to investigate my character to Mr. Goodricke. He will bear witness that I can be trusted to tell the truth. 

(Signed) JANE GOULD
