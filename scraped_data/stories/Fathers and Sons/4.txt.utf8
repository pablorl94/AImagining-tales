V 

Next morning Bazarov was the first to awake and go out of doors. 

"Ah," thought he to himself as he gazed about him, "this is _not_ much of a place to look at." 

When apportioning allotments to his peasantry, Nikolai Petrovitch had found himself forced to exclude from the new "farm" four _desiatins_ of level, naked land, and upon this space had built himself a house, quarters for his servants, and a homestead. Also, he had laid out a garden, dug a pond, and sunk two wells. But the young trees had fared badly, very little water had risen in the pond, and the wells had developed a brackish taste. The only vegetation to attain robust growth was a clump of lilacs and acacias, under the shade of which the household was accustomed to take tea or to dine. Within a few minutes Bazarov had traversed all the paths in the garden, visited the stables and the cattlesheds, and made friends with two young household serfs whom he happened to encounter, and with whom he set forth to catch frogs in a marsh about a verst from the manor. 

"For what do you want frogs, _barin_?" asked one of the lads. 

"To make them useful," replied Bazarov (who possessed a peculiar gift for winning the confidence of his inferiors, even though he never cozened them, but, on the contrary, always treated them with asperity). "You see, I like to open them, and then to observe what their insides are doing. You and I are frogs too, except that we walk upon our hind legs. Thus the operation helps me to understand what is taking place in ourselves." 

"And what good will that do you?" 

"This. That if you should fall sick, and I should have to treat you, I might avoid some mistakes." 

"Then you are a doctor?" 

"I am." 

"Listen to that, Vasika! The _barin_ says that you and I too are frogs. My word!" 

"I don't like frogs," remarked Vasika, a barefooted boy of seven with a head as white as tow, and a costume made up of a grey blouse and a stiff collar. 

"_Why_ don't you like them?" asked Bazarov. "Do you think they will bite you? Nay! Into the water, my young philosophers!" 

Nikolai Petrovitch too had left his bed, and, on going to visit Arkady, found him fully dressed; wherefore father and son proceeded to repair to the terrace, and there seated themselves under the shade of the awning. Amid nosegays of lilac, a tea-urn was simmering on a table by the balustrade, and presently there appeared upon the scene also the damsel who, on the previous night, had met the arrivals on the verandah. She announced in shrill tones: 

"Theodosia Nikolaevna is not very well this morning, and cannot come to breakfast. So she has told me to ask you whether you will pour out tea for yourselves, or whether she is to send Duniasha?" 

"I will pour it out myself," Nikolai Petrovitch replied with some haste. "Will you have cream or lemon in your tea, Arkady?" 

"Cream," he replied. After a pause he continued: 

"Papasha----" 

Nikolai Petrovitch glanced confusedly in his direction. 

"Yes?" said he. 

Arkady lowered his eyes. 

"Pardon me if my question should seem to you indiscreet," he began, "but, owing to your frankness of last night, I am emboldened to return it. You will not take offence, will you?" 

"Oh no! Pray go on." 

"Then I feel encouraged to ask you whether it--whether it is because I am here that she--that is to say, Thenichka--has not joined us at breakfast?" 

Nikolai Petrovitch slightly averted his face. 

"It may be so," he said at length. "At all events, I presume that--that she prefers, she prefers--in fact, that she is shy." 

Arkady glanced at his father. 

"But why should she be shy?" he inquired. "In the first place, you know my views" (he uttered the words with no little complacency), "and, in the second place, surely you cannot suppose that I would by a hair's breadth intrude upon your life and your habits? No; sure am I that never could you make a bad choice; and if you have asked this girl to reside under your roof, that is tantamount to saying that she has well deserved it. In any case, moreover, it is not for a son to summon his father to judgment--least of all for me, who possess a father like yourself, a father who has never restricted his son's freedom of action." 

At first Arkady's voice had trembled a little, since not only did he feel that he was doing the "magnanimous," but also he knew that he was delivering something like a "lecture" to his father; but such an effect does the sound of his own voice exercise upon a human being that towards the end Arkady pronounced his words firmly, and even with a certain degree of _empressement_. 

"I thank you, Arkady," Nikolai Petrovitch said faintly as his fingers began their customary perambulation of his forehead. "Nor is your conjecture mistaken, for if this girl had not deserved the invitation, I should not, of course, have--in other words, as you imply, this is no frivolous whim on my part. Nor need I have spoken of the matter, were it not that I desired you to understand that she might possibly have felt embarrassed at meeting you on the very day after your arrival." 

"Then let _me_ go and meet _her_," exclaimed Arkady with another access of "magnanimity" as he sprang from his chair. "Yes, let _me_ go and explain to her why she need not shun me." 

Nikolai Petrovitch also rose. 

"Arkady," he began, "pray do me a favour. Hitherto I had not warned you that----" 

But, without listening to him, Arkady darted from the terrace. For a moment or two Nikolai Petrovitch gazed after him--then, overcome with confusion, relapsed into a chair. His heart was beating rapidly. Whether or not he was picturing to himself a strangeness of future relations with his son; whether he was imagining that, had his son refrained from interfering, the latter might have paid him more respect in future; whether he was reproaching himself for his own weakness--it is difficult to say what his thoughts were. Probably in them there was a combination of the feelings just indicated, if only in the form of apprehensions. Yet those apprehensions cannot have been deeply rooted, as was proved by the fact that, for all the beating of his heart, the colour had not left his face. 

Soon hasty footsteps were heard approaching, and Arkady reappeared on the terrace. 

"I have made her acquaintance!" he shouted with a kindly, good-humoured, triumphant expression. "That Theodosia Nikolaievna is not well to-day is a fact; but also it is a fact that she is going to appear later. And why did you not tell me that I had a little brother? Otherwise I should have gone and kissed him last night, even as I have done this moment." 

Nikolai Petrovitch tried to say something--to rise and to make an explanation of some sort; but Arkady cut him short by falling upon his neck. 

"What is this? Again embracing?" said Paul Petrovitch behind them. 

As a matter of fact, neither father nor son was ill-pleased to see him appear, for, however touching such situations may be, one may be equally glad to escape from them. 

"At what are you surprised?" asked Nikolai Petrovitch gaily. "Remember that I have not seen Arkesha for several centuries--at all events, not since last night!" 

"Oh, I am not surprised," said Paul Petrovitch. "On the contrary, I should not mind embracing him myself." 

And Arkady, on approaching his uncle, felt once more upon his cheek the impression of a perfumed moustache. Paul Petrovitch then sat down to table. Clad in an elegant morning suit of English cut, he was flaunting on his head a diminutive fez which helped the carelessly folded tie to symbolise the freedom of a country life. At the same time, the stiff collar of the shirt (which was striped, not white, as best befitted a matutinal toilet) supported with its usual rigour an immaculately shaven chin. 

"Well, Arkady?" said he. "Where is your new friend?" 

"Out somewhere. He seldom misses going for an early morning walk. But the great thing is to take no notice of him, for he detests all ceremony." 

"So I have perceived." And with his usual deliberateness Paul Petrovitch began to butter a piece of bread. "Will he be staying here very long?" 

"Well, as long as he may care to stay. As a matter of fact, he is going on to his father's place." 

"And where does his father live?" 

"Some eighty versts from here, in the same province as ourselves. I believe he has a small property, and used to be an army doctor." 

"H'm! Ever since last night I have been asking myself where I can have heard the name before. Nikolai, do you remember whether there was a doctor of that name in our father's division?" 

"Yes, there used to be." 

"Then that doctor will be this fellow's father. H'm!" And Paul Petrovitch twitched his moustache. "What exactly is your Bazarov?" he enquired of Arkady. 

"What _is_ he?" Arkady repeated smiling. "Do you really want me to tell you what he is, Uncle?" 

"If you please, my nephew." 

"He is a Nihilist." 

"A what?" exclaimed Nikolai Petrovitch, while even Paul Petrovitch paused in the act of raising a knife to the edge of which there was a morsel of butter adhering. 

"A Nihilist," repeated Arkady. 

"A Nihilist?" queried Nikolai Petrovitch. "I imagine that that must be a term derived from the Latin _nihil_ or 'nothing.' It denotes, I presume, a man who--a man who--well, a man who declines to accept _anything_." 

"Or a man who declines to _respect_ anything," hazarded Paul Petrovitch as he re-applied himself to the butter. 

"No, a man who treats things solely from the critical point of view," corrected Arkady. 

"But the two things are one and the same, are they not?" queried Paul Petrovitch. 

"Oh no. A Nihilist is a man who declines to bow to authority, or to accept any principle on trust, however sanctified it may be." 

"And to what can that lead?" asked Paul Petrovitch. 

"It depends upon the individual. In one man's case, it may lead to good; in that of another, to evil." 

"I see. But we elders view things differently. We folk of the older generation believe that without principles" (Paul Petrovitch pronounced the word softly, and with a French accent, whereas Arkady had pronounced it with an emphasis on the leading syllable)--"without principles it is impossible to take a single step in life, or to draw a single breath. _Mais vous avez changé tout cela._ God send you health and a general's rank, Messieurs Nihil--how do you pronounce it?" 

"Ni-hi-lists," said Arkady distinctly. 

"Quite so (formerly we had Hegelists, and now they have become Nihilists)--God send you health and a general's rank, but also let us see how you will contrive to exist in an absolute void, an airless vacuum. Pray ring the bell, brother Nikolai, for it is time for me to take my cocoa." 

Nikolai Petrovitch did as requested, and also shouted for Duniasha; but, instead of the latter, there issued on to the terrace Thenichka in person. A young woman of twenty-three, she was pale, and gentle-looking, with dark eyes and hair, a pair of childishly red, pouting lips, and delicate hands. Also, she was clad in a clean cotton gown, a new blue kerchief was thrown lightly over her rounded shoulders, and she was carrying in front of her a large cup of cocoa. Shyly she placed the latter before Paul Petrovitch, while a warm, rosy current of blood suffused the exquisite skin of her comely face, and then she remained standing by the table, with lowered eyes and the tips of her fingers touching its surface. Yet, though she looked as though she were regretting having come, she looked as though she felt that she had a right to be there. 

Paul Petrovitch frowned, and Nikolai Petrovitch looked confused. 

"Good morning, Thenichka," the latter muttered. 

"Good morning," she replied in a low, clear voice. Then she glanced askance at Arkady, and he smiled at her in friendly fashion. Finally she departed with a quiet step and slightly careless gait--the latter a peculiarity of hers. 

Silence reigned on the terrace. For a while Paul Petrovitch drank his cocoa. Then he suddenly raised his head, and muttered: 

"Monsieur Nihilist is about to give us the pleasure of his company." 

True enough, Bazarov could be seen stepping across the flowerbeds. On his linen jacket and trousers was a thick coating of mud, to the crown of his ancient circular hat clung a piece of sticky marshweed, and in his hand he was holding a small bag. Also, something in the bag kept stirring as though it were alive. Approaching the terrace with rapid strides, he nodded to the company and said: 

"Good morning, gentlemen! Pardon me for being so late. I shall be back presently, but first my captures must be stowed away." 

"What are those captures?" Paul Petrovitch inquired. "Leeches?" 

"No, frogs." 

"Do you eat them? Or do you breed them?" 

"I catch them for purposes of experiment," was Bazarov's only reply as carelessly he entered the house. 

"In other words, he vivisects them," was Paul Petrovitch's comment. "In other words, he believes in frogs more than in principles." 

Arkady threw his uncle a reproachful look, and even Nikolai Petrovitch shrugged his shoulders, so that Paul Petrovitch himself felt his _bon mot_ to have been out of place, and hastened to divert the subject to the estate and the new steward.
