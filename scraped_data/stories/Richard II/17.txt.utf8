Scene 5 

<ACTION>Enter Richard alone.</ACTION> 

RICHARD I have been studying how I may compare This prison where I live unto the world, And for because the world is populous And here is not a creature but myself, I cannot do it. Yet I’ll hammer it out. My brain I’ll prove the female to my soul, My soul the father, and these two beget A generation of still-breeding thoughts, And these same thoughts people this little world, In humors like the people of this world, For no thought is contented. The better sort, As thoughts of things divine, are intermixed With scruples, and do set the word itself Against the word, as thus: “Come, little ones,” And then again,	 “It is as hard to come as for a camel To thread the postern of a small needle’s eye.” Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot Unlikely wonders: how these vain weak nails May tear a passage through the flinty ribs	 Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls, And, for they cannot, die in their own pride. 

Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves That they are not the first of fortune’s slaves, Nor shall not be the last—like silly beggars	 Who, sitting in the stocks, refuge their shame That many have and others must sit there, And in this thought they find a kind of ease, Bearing their own misfortunes on the back Of such as have before endured the like.Thus play I in one person many people, And none contented. Sometimes am I king. Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar, And so I am; then crushing penury Persuades me I was better when a king. Then am I kinged again, and by and by Think that I am unkinged by Bolingbroke, And straight am nothing. But whate’er I be, Nor I nor any man that but man is With nothing shall be pleased till he be eased	 With being nothing. (The music plays.) Music do I hear? Ha, ha, keep time! How sour sweet music is When time is broke and no proportion kept. So is it in the music of men’s lives. And here have I the daintiness of ear To check time broke in a disordered string; But for the concord of my state and time Had not an ear to hear my true time broke. 

I wasted time, and now doth time waste me; For now hath time made me his numb’ring clock.My thoughts are minutes, and with sighs they jar Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch, Whereto my finger, like a dial’s point, Is pointing still in cleansing them from tears. Now, sir, the sound that tells what hour it is Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart, Which is the bell. So sighs and tears and groans Show minutes, times, and hours. But my time Runs posting on in Bolingbroke’s proud joy,	 While I stand fooling here, his jack of the clock. This music mads me. Let it sound no more, For though it have holp madmen to their wits, In me it seems it will make wise men mad. Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me,	 For ’tis a sign of love, and love to Richard Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world. 

<ACTION>Enter a Groom of the stable.</ACTION> 

GROOM  Hail, royal prince! 

RICHARD Thanks, noble peer. The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.	 What art thou, and how comest thou hither, Where no man never comes but that sad dog That brings me food to make misfortune live? 

GROOM I was a poor groom of thy stable, king, When thou wert king; who, traveling towards York,	 With much ado at length have gotten leave To look upon my sometime royal master’s face. O, how it earned my heart when I beheld In London streets, that coronation day, When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary, That horse that thou so often hast bestrid, That horse that I so carefully have dressed. 

RICHARD Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend, How went he under him? 

GROOM So proudly as if he disdained the ground. 

RICHARD So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back! That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand; This hand hath made him proud with clapping him. Would he not stumble? Would he not fall down (Since pride must have a fall) and break the neck	 Of that proud man that did usurp his back? Forgiveness, horse! Why do I rail on thee, Since thou, created to be awed by man, Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse, And yet I bear a burden like an ass,	 Spurred, galled, and tired by jauncing Bolingbroke. 

<ACTION>Enter one, the Keeper, to Richard with meat.</ACTION> 

KEEPER ,  <ACTION>to Groom</ACTION> Fellow, give place. Here is no longer stay. 

RICHARD ,  <ACTION>to Groom</ACTION> If thou love me, ’tis time thou wert away. 

GROOM What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say. 

<ACTION>Groom exits.</ACTION> 

KEEPER  My lord, will ’t please you to fall to?	 

RICHARD Taste of it first as thou art wont to do. 

KEEPER My lord, I dare not. Sir Pierce of Exton, Who lately came from the King, commands the contrary. 

RICHARD , <ACTION> attacking the Keeper</ACTION> The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!	 Patience is stale, and I am weary of it. 

KEEPER Help, help, help! 

<ACTION>The Murderers Exton and his men rush in.</ACTION> 

RICHARD How now, what means death in this rude assault? Villain, thy own hand yields thy death’s instrument. 

<ACTION>Richard seizes a weapon from a Murdererand kills him with it.</ACTION> 

Go thou and fill another room in hell.	 

<ACTION>He kills another Murderer.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Here Exton strikes him down.</ACTION> 

That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand Hath with the King’s blood stained the King’s own land. Mount, mount, my soul. Thy seat is up on high,	 Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die. 

<ACTION>He dies.</ACTION> 

EXTON As full of valor as of royal blood. Both have I spilled. O, would the deed were good! For now the devil that told me I did well Says that this deed is chronicled in hell. This dead king to the living king I’ll bear. Take hence the rest and give them burial here. 

<ACTION>They exit with the bodies.</ACTION>
