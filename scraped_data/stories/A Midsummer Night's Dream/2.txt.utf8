<ACTION>Enter a Fairy at one door and Robin Goodfellow atanother.</ACTION> 

ROBIN How now, spirit? Whither wander you? 

FAIRY Over hill, over dale, Thorough bush, thorough brier, Over park, over pale, Thorough flood, thorough fire;	 I do wander everywhere, Swifter than the moon’s sphere. And I serve the Fairy Queen, To dew her orbs upon the green. The cowslips tall her pensioners be;	 In their gold coats spots you see; Those be rubies, fairy favors; In those freckles live their savors. I must go seek some dewdrops here And hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear.	 Farewell, thou lob of spirits. I’ll be gone. Our queen and all her elves come here anon. 

ROBIN The King doth keep his revels here tonight. Take heed the Queen come not within his sight, For Oberon is passing fell and wrath	 Because that she, as her attendant, hath A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king; She never had so sweet a changeling. And jealous Oberon would have the child Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild.	 But she perforce withholds the lovèd boy, Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy. And now they never meet in grove or green, By fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen,	 But they do square, that all their elves for fear Creep into acorn cups and hide them there. 

FAIRY Either I mistake your shape and making quite, Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite Called Robin Goodfellow. Are not you he	 That frights the maidens of the villagery, Skim milk, and sometimes labor in the quern And bootless make the breathless huswife churn, And sometime make the drink to bear no barm, Mislead night wanderers, laughing at their harm?	 Those that “Hobgoblin” call you and “sweet Puck,” You do their work, and they shall have good luck. Are not you he? 

ROBIN Thou speakest aright. I am that merry wanderer of the night.	 I jest to Oberon and make him smile When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile, Neighing in likeness of a filly foal. And sometime lurk I in a gossip’s bowl In very likeness of a roasted crab,	 And, when she drinks, against her lips I bob And on her withered dewlap pour the ale. The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale, Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me; Then slip I from her bum, down topples she	 And “Tailor!” cries and falls into a cough, And then the whole choir hold their hips and loffe And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear A merrier hour was never wasted there. But room, fairy. Here comes Oberon.	 

FAIRY And here my mistress. Would that he were gone! 

<ACTION>Enter Oberon the King of Fairies at one door, with histrain, and Titania the Queen at another, with hers.</ACTION> 

OBERON Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania. 

TITANIA What, jealous Oberon? Fairies, skip hence. I have forsworn his bed and company. 

OBERON Tarry, rash wanton. Am not I thy lord?	 

TITANIA Then I must be thy lady. But I know When thou hast stolen away from Fairyland And in the shape of Corin sat all day Playing on pipes of corn and versing love To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,	 Come from the farthest steep of India, But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon, Your buskined mistress and your warrior love, To Theseus must be wedded, and you come To give their bed joy and prosperity?	 

OBERON How canst thou thus for shame, Titania, Glance at my credit with Hippolyta, Knowing I know thy love to Theseus? Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night	 From Perigouna, whom he ravishèd, And make him with fair Aegles break his faith, With Ariadne and Antiopa? 

TITANIA These are the forgeries of jealousy; And never, since the middle summer’s spring,	 Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead, By pavèd fountain or by rushy brook, Or in the beachèd margent of the sea, To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind, But with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport. Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain, As in revenge have sucked up from the sea Contagious fogs, which, falling in the land, Hath every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents. The ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain, The plowman lost his sweat, and the green corn Hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard. The fold stands empty in the drownèd field, And crows are fatted with the murrain flock. The nine-men’s-morris is filled up with mud, And the quaint mazes in the wanton green, For lack of tread, are undistinguishable. The human mortals want their winter here. No night is now with hymn or carol blessed. Therefore the moon, the governess of floods, Pale in her anger, washes all the air, That rheumatic diseases do abound. 

And thorough this distemperature we see The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts	 Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose, And on old Hiems’ thin and icy crown An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds Is, as in mockery, set.The spring, the summer, The childing autumn, angry winter, change	 Their wonted liveries, and the mazèd world By their increase now knows not which is which. And this same progeny of evils comes From our debate, from our dissension; We are their parents and original. 

OBERON Do you amend it, then. It lies in you. Why should Titania cross her Oberon? I do but beg a little changeling boy To be my henchman. 

TITANIA Set your heart at rest:	 The Fairyland buys not the child of me. His mother was a vot’ress of my order, And in the spicèd Indian air by night Full often hath she gossiped by my side And sat with me on Neptune’s yellow sands,	 Marking th’ embarkèd traders on the flood, When we have laughed to see the sails conceive And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind; Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait, Following (her womb then rich with my young	 squire), Would imitate and sail upon the land To fetch me trifles and return again, As from a voyage, rich with merchandise. But she, being mortal, of that boy did die,	 And for her sake do I rear up her boy, And for her sake I will not part with him. 

OBERON How long within this wood intend you stay? 

TITANIA Perchance till after Theseus’ wedding day. If you will patiently dance in our round	 And see our moonlight revels, go with us. If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts. 

OBERON Give me that boy and I will go with thee. 

TITANIA Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away. We shall chide downright if I longer stay.	 

<ACTION>Titania and her fairies exit.</ACTION> 

OBERON Well, go thy way. Thou shalt not from this grove Till I torment thee for this injury.— My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb’rest Since once I sat upon a promontory And heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s back	 Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath That the rude sea grew civil at her song And certain stars shot madly from their spheres To hear the sea-maid’s music. 

ROBIN I remember.	 

OBERON That very time I saw (but thou couldst not), Flying between the cold moon and the Earth, Cupid all armed. A certain aim he took At a fair vestal thronèd by the west, And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow	 As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts. But I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft Quenched in the chaste beams of the wat’ry moon, And the imperial vot’ress passèd on In maiden meditation, fancy-free.	 Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell. It fell upon a little western flower, Before, milk-white, now purple with love’s wound, And maidens call it “love-in-idleness.” Fetch me that flower; the herb I showed thee once.	 The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid Will make or man or woman madly dote Upon the next live creature that it sees. Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a league.	 

ROBIN I’ll put a girdle round about the Earth In forty minutes.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

OBERON Having once this juice, I’ll watch Titania when she is asleep And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.	 The next thing then she, waking, looks upon (Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull, On meddling monkey, or on busy ape) She shall pursue it with the soul of love. And ere I take this charm from off her sight	 (As I can take it with another herb), I’ll make her render up her page to me. But who comes here? I am invisible, And I will overhear their conference. 

<ACTION>Enter Demetrius, Helena following him.</ACTION> 

DEMETRIUS I love thee not; therefore pursue me not.	 Where is Lysander and fair Hermia? The one I’ll stay; the other stayeth me. Thou told’st me they were stol’n unto this wood, And here am I, and wood within this wood Because I cannot meet my Hermia.	 Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more. 

HELENA You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant! But yet you draw not iron, for my heart Is true as steel. Leave you your power to draw, And I shall have no power to follow you.	 

DEMETRIUS Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair? Or rather do I not in plainest truth Tell you I do not, nor I cannot love you? 

HELENA And even for that do I love you the more. I am your spaniel, and, Demetrius,	 The more you beat me I will fawn on you. Use me but as your spaniel: spurn me, strike me, Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave (Unworthy as I am) to follow you. What worser place can I beg in your love	 (And yet a place of high respect with me) Than to be usèd as you use your dog? 

DEMETRIUS Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit, For I am sick when I do look on thee. 

HELENA And I am sick when I look not on you.	 

DEMETRIUS You do impeach your modesty too much To leave the city and commit yourself Into the hands of one that loves you not, To trust the opportunity of night And the ill counsel of a desert place	 With the rich worth of your virginity. 

HELENA Your virtue is my privilege. For that It is not night when I do see your face, Therefore I think I am not in the night. Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,	 For you, in my respect, are all the world. Then, how can it be said I am alone When all the world is here to look on me? 

DEMETRIUS I’ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.	 

HELENA The wildest hath not such a heart as you. Run when you will. The story shall be changed: Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase; The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind Makes speed to catch the tiger. Bootless speed	 When cowardice pursues and valor flies! 

DEMETRIUS I will not stay thy questions. Let me go, Or if thou follow me, do not believe But I shall do thee mischief in the wood. 

HELENA Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,	 You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius! Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex. We cannot fight for love as men may do. We should be wooed and were not made to woo. 

<ACTION>Demetrius exits.</ACTION> 

I’ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell	 To die upon the hand I love so well.	 

<ACTION>Helena exits.</ACTION> 

OBERON Fare thee well, nymph. Ere he do leave this grove, Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love. 

<ACTION>Enter Robin.</ACTION> 

Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer. 

ROBIN Ay, there it is.	 

OBERON I pray thee give it me. Robin gives him the flower. I know a bank where the wild thyme blows, Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows, Quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine, With sweet muskroses, and with eglantine.	 There sleeps Titania sometime of the night, Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight. And there the snake throws her enameled skin, Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in. And with the juice of this I’ll streak her eyes	 And make her full of hateful fantasies. Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove. He gives Robin part of the flower. A sweet Athenian lady is in love With a disdainful youth. Anoint his eyes, But do it when the next thing he espies	 May be the lady. Thou shalt know the man By the Athenian garments he hath on. Effect it with some care, that he may prove More fond on her than she upon her love. And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.	 

ROBIN Fear not, my lord. Your servant shall do so. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
