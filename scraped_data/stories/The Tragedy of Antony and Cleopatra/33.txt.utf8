<ACTION>Enter a Sentry and his company. Enobarbus follows.</ACTION> 

SENTRY If we be not relieved within this hour, We must return to th’ court of guard. The night Is shiny, and they say we shall embattle By th’ second hour i’ th’ morn. 

FIRST WATCH This last day was a shrewd one to ’s.	 

ENOBARBUS O, bear me witness, night— 

SECOND WATCH What man is this? 

FIRST WATCH  Stand close, and list him. 

ENOBARBUS Be witness to me, O thou blessèd moon, When men revolted shall upon record	 Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did Before thy face repent. 

SENTRY Enobarbus? 

SECOND WATCH Peace! Hark further. 

ENOBARBUS O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,	 The poisonous damp of night dispunge upon me, That life, a very rebel to my will, May hang no longer on me. Throw my heart Against the flint and hardness of my fault, Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder	 And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony, Nobler than my revolt is infamous, Forgive me in thine own particular, But let the world rank me in register A master-leaver and a fugitive.	 O Antony! O Antony!	 

<ACTION>He dies.</ACTION> 

FIRST WATCH Let’s speak to him. 

SENTRY Let’s hear him, for the things he speaks may concern Caesar. 

SECOND WATCH Let’s do so. But he sleeps.	 

SENTRY Swoons rather, for so bad a prayer as his Was never yet for sleep. 

FIRST WATCH Go we to him. 

SECOND WATCH Awake, sir, awake! Speak to us. 

FIRST WATCH  Hear you, sir?	 

SENTRY The hand of death hath raught him.	 <ACTION>Drums afar off.</ACTION> Hark, the drums Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him To th’ court of guard; he is of note. Our hour Is fully out.	 

SECOND WATCH Come on then. He may recover yet. 

<ACTION>They exit, carrying Enobarbus’ body.</ACTION>
