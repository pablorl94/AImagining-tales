<ACTION>Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, and Philostrate, with others.</ACTION> 

THESEUS Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour Draws on apace. Four happy days bring in Another moon. But, O, methinks how slow This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires Like to a stepdame or a dowager	 Long withering out a young man’s revenue. 

HIPPOLYTA Four days will quickly steep themselves in night; Four nights will quickly dream away the time; And then the moon, like to a silver bow New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night	 Of our solemnities. 

THESEUS Go, Philostrate, Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments. Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth. Turn melancholy forth to funerals;	 The pale companion is not for our pomp. 

<ACTION>Philostrate exits.</ACTION> 

Hippolyta, I wooed thee with my sword And won thy love doing thee injuries, But I will wed thee in another key, With pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.	 

<ACTION>Enter Egeus and his daughter Hermia, and Lysander  and Demetrius.</ACTION> 

EGEUS Happy be Theseus, our renownèd duke! 

THESEUS Thanks, good Egeus. What’s the news with thee? 

EGEUS Full of vexation come I, with complaint Against my child, my daughter Hermia.— Stand forth, Demetrius.—My noble lord,	 This man hath my consent to marry her.— Stand forth, Lysander.—And, my gracious duke, This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child.— Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes And interchanged love tokens with my child.	 Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung With feigning voice verses of feigning love And stol’n the impression of her fantasy With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits, Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats—messengers	 Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth. With cunning hast thou filched my daughter’s heart, Turned her obedience (which is due to me) To stubborn harshness.—And, my gracious duke, Be it so she will not here before your Grace	 Consent to marry with Demetrius, I beg the ancient privilege of Athens: As she is mine, I may dispose of her, Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death, according to our law	 Immediately provided in that case. 

THESEUS What say you, Hermia? Be advised, fair maid. To you, your father should be as a god, One that composed your beauties, yea, and one To whom you are but as a form in wax	 By him imprinted, and within his power To leave the figure or disfigure it. Demetrius is a worthy gentleman. 

HERMIA So is Lysander. 

THESEUS In himself he is,	 But in this kind, wanting your father’s voice, The other must be held the worthier. 

HERMIA I would my father looked but with my eyes. 

THESEUS Rather your eyes must with his judgment look. 

HERMIA I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.	 I know not by what power I am made bold, Nor how it may concern my modesty In such a presence here to plead my thoughts; But I beseech your Grace that I may know The worst that may befall me in this case	 If I refuse to wed Demetrius. 

THESEUS Either to die the death or to abjure Forever the society of men. Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires, Know of your youth, examine well your blood,	 Whether (if you yield not to your father’s choice) You can endure the livery of a nun, For aye to be in shady cloister mewed, To live a barren sister all your life, Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.	 Thrice-blessèd they that master so their blood To undergo such maiden pilgrimage, But earthlier happy is the rose distilled Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn, Grows, lives, and dies in single blessedness.	 

HERMIA So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord, Ere I will yield my virgin patent up Unto his Lordship whose unwishèd yoke My soul consents not to give sovereignty. 

THESEUS Take time to pause, and by the next new moon	 (The sealing day betwixt my love and me For everlasting bond of fellowship), Upon that day either prepare to die For disobedience to your father’s will, Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,	 Or on Diana’s altar to protest For aye austerity and single life. 

DEMETRIUS Relent, sweet Hermia, and, Lysander, yield Thy crazèd title to my certain right. 

LYSANDER You have her father’s love, Demetrius.	 Let me have Hermia’s. Do you marry him. 

EGEUS Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love; And what is mine my love shall render him. And she is mine, and all my right of her I do estate unto Demetrius.	 

LYSANDER , <ACTION> to Theseus</ACTION> I am, my lord, as well derived as he, As well possessed. My love is more than his; My fortunes every way as fairly ranked (If not with vantage) as Demetrius’; And (which is more than all these boasts can be)	 I am beloved of beauteous Hermia. Why should not I then prosecute my right? Demetrius, I’ll avouch it to his head, Made love to Nedar’s daughter, Helena, And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,	 Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry, Upon this spotted and inconstant man. 

THESEUS I must confess that I have heard so much, And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof; But, being overfull of self-affairs,	 My mind did lose it.—But, Demetrius, come, And come, Egeus; you shall go with me. I have some private schooling for you both.— For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself To fit your fancies to your father’s will,	 Or else the law of Athens yields you up (Which by no means we may extenuate) To death or to a vow of single life.— Come, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?— Demetrius and Egeus, go along.	 I must employ you in some business Against our nuptial and confer with you Of something nearly that concerns yourselves. 

EGEUS With duty and desire we follow you. 

<ACTION>All but Hermia and Lysander exit.</ACTION> 

LYSANDER How now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?	 How chance the roses there do fade so fast? 

HERMIA Belike for want of rain, which I could well Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes. 

LYSANDER Ay me! For aught that I could ever read, Could ever hear by tale or history,	 The course of true love never did run smooth. But either it was different in blood— 

HERMIA O cross! Too high to be enthralled to low. 

LYSANDER Or else misgraffèd in respect of years— 

HERMIA O spite! Too old to be engaged to young.	 

LYSANDER Or else it stood upon the choice of friends— 

HERMIA O hell, to choose love by another’s eyes! 

LYSANDER Or, if there were a sympathy in choice, War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it, Making it momentany as a sound,	 Swift as a shadow, short as any dream, Brief as the lightning in the collied night, That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and Earth, And, ere a man hath power to say “Behold!” The jaws of darkness do devour it up.	 So quick bright things come to confusion. 

HERMIA If then true lovers have been ever crossed, It stands as an edict in destiny. Then let us teach our trial patience Because it is a customary cross,	 As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs, Wishes and tears, poor fancy’s followers. 

LYSANDER A good persuasion. Therefore, hear me, Hermia: I have a widow aunt, a dowager Of great revenue, and she hath no child.	 From Athens is her house remote seven leagues, And she respects me as her only son. There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee; And to that place the sharp Athenian law Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me, then	 Steal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night, And in the wood a league without the town (Where I did meet thee once with Helena To do observance to a morn of May), There will I stay for thee.	 

HERMIA My good Lysander, I swear to thee by Cupid’s strongest bow, By his best arrow with the golden head, By the simplicity of Venus’ doves, By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,	 And by that fire which burned the Carthage queen When the false Trojan under sail was seen, By all the vows that ever men have broke (In number more than ever women spoke), In that same place thou hast appointed me,	 Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee. 

LYSANDER Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena. 

<ACTION>Enter Helena.</ACTION> 

HERMIA Godspeed, fair Helena. Whither away? 

HELENA Call you me “fair”? That “fair” again unsay. Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!	 Your eyes are lodestars and your tongue’s sweet air More tunable than lark to shepherd’s ear When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear. Sickness is catching. O, were favor so! Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.	 My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye; My tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody. Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated, The rest I’d give to be to you translated.	 O, teach me how you look and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius’ heart! 

HERMIA I frown upon him, yet he loves me still. 

HELENA O, that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!	 

HERMIA I give him curses, yet he gives me love. 

HELENA O, that my prayers could such affection move! 

HERMIA The more I hate, the more he follows me. 

HELENA The more I love, the more he hateth me. 

HERMIA His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.	 

HELENA None but your beauty. Would that fault were mine! 

HERMIA Take comfort: he no more shall see my face. Lysander and myself will fly this place. Before the time I did Lysander see Seemed Athens as a paradise to me.	 O, then, what graces in my love do dwell That he hath turned a heaven unto a hell! 

LYSANDER Helen, to you our minds we will unfold. Tomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold Her silver visage in the wat’ry glass,	 Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass (A time that lovers’ flights doth still conceal), Through Athens’ gates have we devised to steal. 

HERMIA And in the wood where often you and I Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,	 Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet, There my Lysander and myself shall meet And thence from Athens turn away our eyes To seek new friends and stranger companies. Farewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,	 And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius.— Keep word, Lysander. We must starve our sight From lovers’ food till morrow deep midnight. 

LYSANDER I will, my Hermia.	 <ACTION>Hermia exits.</ACTION> Helena, adieu.	 As you on him, Demetrius dote on you! <ACTION>Lysander exits.</ACTION> 

HELENA How happy some o’er other some can be! Through Athens I am thought as fair as she. But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so. He will not know what all but he do know. And, as he errs, doting on Hermia’s eyes, So I, admiring of his qualities. Things base and vile, holding no quantity, Love can transpose to form and dignity. Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind;	 And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind. Nor hath Love’s mind of any judgment taste. Wings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste. And therefore is Love said to be a child Because in choice he is so oft beguiled. As waggish boys in game themselves forswear, So the boy Love is perjured everywhere. For, ere Demetrius looked on Hermia’s eyne, He hailed down oaths that he was only mine; And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,	 So he dissolved, and show’rs of oaths did melt. I will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight. Then to the wood will he tomorrow night Pursue her. And, for this intelligence If I have thanks, it is a dear expense. 

But herein mean I to enrich my pain, To have his sight thither and back again.
