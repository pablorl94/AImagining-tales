<ACTION>Flourish. Enter King Henry, Exeter, Gloucester, andWinchester; Richard Plantagenet and Warwick,with white roses; Somerset and Suffolk, with redroses; and Others. Gloucester offers to put up a bill.Winchester snatches it, tears it.</ACTION> 

WINCHESTER Com’st thou with deep premeditated lines, With written pamphlets studiously devised? Humphrey of Gloucester, if thou canst accuse Or aught intend’st to lay unto my charge, Do it without invention, suddenly,	 As I with sudden and extemporal speech Purpose to answer what thou canst object. 

GLOUCESTER Presumptuous priest, this place commands my patience, Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonored me.	 Think not, although in writing I preferred The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes, That therefore I have forged or am not able Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen. No, prelate, such is thy audacious wickedness,	 Thy lewd, pestiferous, and dissentious pranks, As very infants prattle of thy pride. Thou art a most pernicious usurer, Froward by nature, enemy to peace, Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems	 A man of thy profession and degree. And for thy treachery, what’s more manifest, In that thou laid’st a trap to take my life As well at London Bridge as at the Tower? Besides, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,	 The King, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt From envious malice of thy swelling heart. 

WINCHESTER Gloucester, I do defy thee.—Lords, vouchsafe To give me hearing what I shall reply. If I were covetous, ambitious, or perverse,	 As he will have me, how am I so poor? Or how haps it I seek not to advance Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling? And for dissension, who preferreth peace More than I do, except I be provoked?	 No, my good lords, it is not that offends; It is not that that hath incensed the Duke. It is because no one should sway but he, No one but he should be about the King; And that engenders thunder in his breast	 And makes him roar these accusations forth. But he shall know I am as good— 

GLOUCESTER As good! Thou bastard of my grandfather! 

WINCHESTER Ay, lordly sir; for what are you, I pray,	 But one imperious in another’s throne? 

GLOUCESTER Am I not Protector, saucy priest? 

WINCHESTER And am not I a prelate of the Church? 

GLOUCESTER Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps, And useth it to patronage his theft.	 

WINCHESTER Unreverent Gloucester! 

GLOUCESTER Thou art reverend Touching thy spiritual function, not thy life. 

WINCHESTER Rome shall remedy this. 

GLOUCESTER Roam thither then. 

WARWICK , <ACTION> to Winchester</ACTION> My lord, it were your duty to forbear. 

SOMERSET Ay, so the Bishop be not overborne. Methinks my lord should be religious, And know the office that belongs to such. 

WARWICK Methinks his Lordship should be humbler. It fitteth not a prelate so to plead. 

SOMERSET Yes, when his holy state is touched so near. 

WARWICK State holy, or unhallowed, what of that? Is not his Grace Protector to the King? 

PLANTAGENET, <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Plantagenet, I see, must hold his tongue,	 Lest it be said “Speak, sirrah, when you should; Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords?” Else would I have a fling at Winchester. 

KING HENRY Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester, The special watchmen of our English weal,	 I would prevail, if prayers might prevail, To join your hearts in love and amity. O, what a scandal is it to our crown That two such noble peers as you should jar! Believe me, lords, my tender years can tell	 Civil dissension is a viperous worm That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth. 

<ACTION>A noise within: “Down with the tawny coats!”</ACTION> 

What tumult ’s this? 

WARWICK An uproar, I dare warrant, Begun through malice of the Bishop’s men.	 

<ACTION>A noise again: “Stones! Stones!”</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Mayor.</ACTION> 

MAYOR O, my good lords, and virtuous Henry, Pity the city of London, pity us! The Bishop and the Duke of Gloucester’s men, Forbidden late to carry any weapon, Have filled their pockets full of pebble stones	 And, banding themselves in contrary parts, Do pelt so fast at one another’s pate That many have their giddy brains knocked out; Our windows are broke down in every street, And we, for fear, compelled to shut our shops <ACTION>.	</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Servingmen in skirmish with bloody pates.</ACTION> 

KING HENRY We charge you, on allegiance to ourself, To hold your slaught’ring hands and keep the peace.— Pray, Uncle Gloucester, mitigate this strife. 

FIRST SERVINGMAN  Nay, if we be forbidden stones, we’ll fall to it with our teeth.	 

SECOND SERVINGMAN Do what you dare, we are as resolute.  

<ACTION>Skirmish again.</ACTION> 

GLOUCESTER You of my household, leave this peevish broil, And set this unaccustomed fight aside. 

THIRD SERVINGMAN My lord, we know your Grace to be a man	 Just and upright, and, for your royal birth, Inferior to none but to his Majesty; And ere that we will suffer such a prince, So kind a father of the commonweal, To be disgracèd by an inkhorn mate,	 We and our wives and children all will fight And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes. 

FIRST SERVINGMAN Ay, and the very parings of our nails Shall pitch a field when we are dead. 

<ACTION>Begin again.</ACTION> 

GLOUCESTER Stay, stay, I say!	 And if you love me, as you say you do, Let me persuade you to forbear awhile. 

KING HENRY O, how this discord doth afflict my soul! Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold My sighs and tears, and will not once relent?	 Who should be pitiful if you be not? Or who should study to prefer a peace If holy churchmen take delight in broils? 

WARWICK Yield, my Lord Protector—yield, Winchester— Except you mean with obstinate repulse	 To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm. You see what mischief, and what murder too, Hath been enacted through your enmity. Then be at peace, except you thirst for blood. 

WINCHESTER He shall submit, or I will never yield.	 

GLOUCESTER Compassion on the King commands me stoop, Or I would see his heart out ere the priest Should ever get that privilege of me. 

WARWICK Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the Duke Hath banished moody discontented fury,	 As by his smoothèd brows it doth appear. Why look you still so stern and tragical? 

GLOUCESTER Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand. 

<ACTION>Winchester refuses Gloucester’s hand.</ACTION> 

KING HENRY Fie, Uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach That malice was a great and grievous sin;	 And will not you maintain the thing you teach, But prove a chief offender in the same? 

WARWICK Sweet king! The Bishop hath a kindly gird.— For shame, my Lord of Winchester, relent; What, shall a child instruct you what to do?	 

WINCHESTER Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to thee; Love for thy love and hand for hand I give. 

<ACTION>They take each other’s hand.</ACTION> 

GLOUCESTER ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Ay, but I fear me with a hollow heart.— See here, my friends and loving countrymen, This token serveth for a flag of truce	 Betwixt ourselves and all our followers, So help me God, as I dissemble not. 

WINCHESTER , <ACTION> aside</ACTION> So help me God, as I intend it not. 

KING HENRY O, loving uncle—kind Duke of Gloucester— How joyful am I made by this contract.	 <ACTION>To the Servingmen. </ACTION> Away, my masters, trouble us no more, But join in friendship as your lords have done. 

FIRST SERVINGMAN   Content. I’ll to the surgeon’s. 

SECOND SERVINGMAN  And so will I.	 

THIRD SERVINGMAN  And I will see what physic the tavern affords. 

<ACTION>They exit with Mayor and Others.</ACTION> 

WARWICK ,  <ACTION>presenting a scroll</ACTION> Accept this scroll, most gracious sovereign, Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet We do exhibit to your Majesty.	 

GLOUCESTER Well urged, my Lord of Warwick.—For, sweet prince, An if your Grace mark every circumstance, You have great reason to do Richard right, Especially for those occasions At Eltham Place I told your Majesty.	 

KING HENRY And those occasions, uncle, were of force.— Therefore, my loving lords, our pleasure is That Richard be restorèd to his blood. 

WARWICK Let Richard be restorèd to his blood; So shall his father’s wrongs be recompensed.	 

WINCHESTER As will the rest, so willeth Winchester. 

KING HENRY If Richard will be true, not that alone But all the whole inheritance I give That doth belong unto the house of York, From whence you spring by lineal descent.	 

PLANTAGENET Thy humble servant vows obedience And humble service till the point of death. 

KING HENRY Stoop then, and set your knee against my foot; <ACTION>Plantagenet kneels.</ACTION> And in reguerdon of that duty done I girt thee with the valiant sword of York.	 Rise, Richard, like a true Plantagenet, And rise created princely Duke of York. 

YORK , <ACTION> formerly PLANTAGENET, standing</ACTION> And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall! And as my duty springs, so perish they That grudge one thought against your Majesty.	 

ALL Welcome, high prince, the mighty Duke of York. 

SOMERSET ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Perish, base prince, ignoble Duke of York. 

GLOUCESTER Now will it best avail your Majesty To cross the seas and to be crowned in France. The presence of a king engenders love	 Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends, As it disanimates his enemies. 

KING HENRY When Gloucester says the word, King Henry goes, For friendly counsel cuts off many foes. 

GLOUCESTER Your ships already are in readiness.	 

<ACTION>Sennet. Flourish. All but Exeter exit.</ACTION> 

EXETER Ay, we may march in England or in France, Not seeing what is likely to ensue. This late dissension grown betwixt the peers Burns under feignèd ashes of forged love And will at last break out into a flame.	 As festered members rot but by degree Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away, So will this base and envious discord breed. And now I fear that fatal prophecy Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth	 Was in the mouth of every sucking babe: That Henry born at Monmouth should win all, And Henry born at Windsor should lose all, Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish His days may finish ere that hapless time.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
