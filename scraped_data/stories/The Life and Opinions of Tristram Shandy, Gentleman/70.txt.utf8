Chapter 2.XIX. 

When Trim came in and told my father, that Dr. Slop was in the kitchen, and busy in making a bridge--my uncle Toby--the affair of the jack-boots having just then raised a train of military ideas in his brain--took it instantly for granted that Dr. Slop was making a model of the marquis d'Hopital's bridge.--'tis very obliging in him, quoth my uncle Toby;--pray give my humble service to Dr. Slop, Trim, and tell him I thank him heartily. 

Had my uncle Toby's head been a Savoyard's box, and my father peeping in all the time at one end of it--it could not have given him a more distinct conception of the operations of my uncle Toby's imagination, than what he had; so, notwithstanding the catapulta and battering-ram, and his bitter imprecation about them, he was just beginning to triumph-- 

When Trim's answer, in an instant, tore the laurel from his brows, and twisted it to pieces.
