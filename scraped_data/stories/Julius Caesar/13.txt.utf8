<ACTION>Enter a Messenger.</ACTION> 

MESSENGER Prepare you, generals. The enemy comes on in gallant show. Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,	 And something to be done immediately. 

ANTONY Octavius, lead your battle softly on Upon the left hand of the even field. 

OCTAVIUS Upon the right hand, I; keep thou the left. 

ANTONY Why do you cross me in this exigent?	 

OCTAVIUS I do not cross you, but I will do so.	 <ACTION>March.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Drum. Enter Brutus, Cassius, and their army includingLucilius, Titinius, and Messala.</ACTION> 

BRUTUS They stand and would have parley. 

CASSIUS Stand fast, Titinius. We must out and talk. 

OCTAVIUS Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle? 

ANTONY No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.	 Make forth. The Generals would have some words. 

OCTAVIUS ,  <ACTION>to his Officers</ACTION> Stir not until the signal. 

<ACTION>The Generals step forward.</ACTION> 

BRUTUS Words before blows; is it so, countrymen? 

OCTAVIUS Not that we love words better, as you do. 

BRUTUS Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.	 

ANTONY In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words. Witness the hole you made in Caesar’s heart, Crying “Long live, hail, Caesar!” 

CASSIUS Antony, The posture of your blows are yet unknown,	 But, for your words, they rob the Hybla bees And leave them honeyless. 

ANTONY Not stingless too. 

BRUTUS O yes, and soundless too, For you have stolen their buzzing, Antony,	 And very wisely threat before you sting. 

ANTONY Villains, you did not so when your vile daggers Hacked one another in the sides of Caesar. You showed your teeth like apes and fawned like hounds	 And bowed like bondmen, kissing Caesar’s feet, Whilst damnèd Casca, like a cur, behind Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers! 

CASSIUS Flatterers?—Now, Brutus, thank yourself! This tongue had not offended so today	 If Cassius might have ruled. 

OCTAVIUS Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat, The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look, I draw a sword against conspirators; <ACTION>He draws.</ACTION> When think you that the sword goes up again?	 Never, till Caesar’s three and thirty wounds Be well avenged, or till another Caesar Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors. 

BRUTUS Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors’ hands Unless thou bring’st them with thee.	 

OCTAVIUS So I hope. I was not born to die on Brutus’ sword. 

BRUTUS O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain, Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable. 

CASSIUS A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honor,	 Joined with a masker and a reveler! 

ANTONY Old Cassius still. 

OCTAVIUS Come, Antony, away!— Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth. If you dare fight today, come to the field;	 If not, when you have stomachs. 

<ACTION>Octavius, Antony, and their army exit.</ACTION> 

CASSIUS Why now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark! The storm is up, and all is on the hazard. 

BRUTUS Ho, Lucilius, hark, a word with you. 

<ACTION>Lucilius and Messala stand forth.</ACTION> 

LUCILIUS My lord?	 

<ACTION>Brutus and Lucilius step aside together.</ACTION> 

CASSIUS Messala. 

MESSALA What says my general? 

CASSIUS Messala, This is my birthday, as this very day Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala.	 Be thou my witness that against my will (As Pompey was) am I compelled to set Upon one battle all our liberties. You know that I held Epicurus strong And his opinion. Now I change my mind	 And partly credit things that do presage. Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perched, Gorging and feeding from our soldiers’ hands, Who to Philippi here consorted us.	 This morning are they fled away and gone, And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites Fly o’er our heads and downward look on us As we were sickly prey. Their shadows seem A canopy most fatal, under which	 Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost. 

MESSALA Believe not so. 

CASSIUS I but believe it partly, For I am fresh of spirit and resolved To meet all perils very constantly.	 

BRUTUS Even so, Lucilius.	 <ACTION>Brutus returns to Cassius.</ACTION> 

CASSIUS Now, most noble Brutus, The gods today stand friendly that we may, Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age. But since the affairs of men rests still incertain,	 Let’s reason with the worst that may befall. If we do lose this battle, then is this The very last time we shall speak together. What are you then determinèd to do? 

BRUTUS Even by the rule of that philosophy	 By which I did blame Cato for the death Which he did give himself (I know not how, But I do find it cowardly and vile, For fear of what might fall, so to prevent The time of life), arming myself with patience	 To stay the providence of some high powers That govern us below. 

CASSIUS Then, if we lose this battle, You are contented to be led in triumph Thorough the streets of Rome?	 

BRUTUS No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman, That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome. He bears too great a mind. But this same day Must end that work the ides of March begun. And whether we shall meet again, I know not.	 Therefore our everlasting farewell take. Forever and forever farewell, Cassius. If we do meet again, why we shall smile; If not, why then this parting was well made. 

CASSIUS Forever and forever farewell, Brutus.	 If we do meet again, we’ll smile indeed; If not, ’tis true this parting was well made. 

BRUTUS Why then, lead on.—O, that a man might know The end of this day’s business ere it come! But it sufficeth that the day will end,	 And then the end is known.—Come ho, away! 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
