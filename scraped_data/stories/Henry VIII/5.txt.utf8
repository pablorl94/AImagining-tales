<ACTION>Enter two Gentlemen at several doors.</ACTION> 

FIRST GENTLEMAN Whither away so fast? 

SECOND GENTLEMAN  O, God save you. E’en to the Hall to hear what shall become Of the great Duke of Buckingham. 

FIRST GENTLEMAN I’ll save you That labor, sir. All’s now done but the ceremony Of bringing back the prisoner. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN Were you there? 

FIRST GENTLEMAN Yes, indeed was I. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN Pray speak what has happened.	 

FIRST GENTLEMAN You may guess quickly what. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN  Is he found guilty? 

FIRST GENTLEMAN Yes, truly, is he, and condemned upon ’t. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN I am sorry for ’t. 

FIRST GENTLEMAN So are a number more.	 

SECOND GENTLEMAN   But pray, how passed it? 

FIRST GENTLEMAN I’ll tell you in a little. The great duke Came to the bar, where to his accusations He pleaded still not guilty and alleged Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.	 The King’s attorney on the contrary Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions Of divers witnesses, which the Duke desired To him brought viva voce to his face; At which appeared against him his surveyor,	 Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor, and John Car, Confessor to him, with that devil monk, Hopkins, that made this mischief. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN  That was he That fed him with his prophecies?	 

FIRST GENTLEMAN The same. All these accused him strongly, which he fain Would have flung from him, but indeed he could not. And so his peers upon this evidence Have found him guilty of high treason. Much	 He spoke, and learnèdly, for life, but all Was either pitied in him or forgotten. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN After all this, how did he bear himself? 

FIRST GENTLEMAN When he was brought again to th’ bar to hear His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirred	 With such an agony he sweat extremely And something spoke in choler, ill and hasty. But he fell to himself again, and sweetly In all the rest showed a most noble patience. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN I do not think he fears death. 

FIRST GENTLEMAN Sure he does not; He never was so womanish. The cause He may a little grieve at. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN Certainly The Cardinal is the end of this.	 

FIRST GENTLEMAN ’Tis likely, By all conjectures; first, Kildare’s attainder, Then Deputy of Ireland, who, removed, Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too, Lest he should help his father. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN  That trick of state Was a deep envious one. 

FIRST GENTLEMAN  At his return No doubt he will requite it. This is noted, And generally: whoever the King favors,	 The Card’nal instantly will find employment, And far enough from court too. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN  All the commons Hate him perniciously and, o’ my conscience, Wish him ten fathom deep. This duke as much	 They love and dote on, call him bounteous Buckingham, The mirror of all courtesy. 

FIRST GENTLEMAN Stay there, sir, And see the noble ruined man you speak of. 

<ACTION>Enter Buckingham from his arraignment, Tipstaves beforehim, the ax with the edge towards him, Halberds on eachside, accompanied with Sir Thomas Lovell, Sir NicholasVaux, Sir Walter Sands, and Common People, etc.</ACTION> 

SECOND GENTLEMAN Let’s stand close and behold him. 

BUCKINGHAM   All good people, You that thus far have come to pity me, Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me. I have this day received a traitor’s judgment, And by that name must die. Yet heaven bear witness, And if I have a conscience, let it sink me Even as the ax falls, if I be not faithful! The law I bear no malice for my death; ’T has done, upon the premises, but justice. But those that sought it I could wish more Christian. Be what they will, I heartily forgive ’em. Yet let ’em look they glory not in mischief, Nor build their evils on the graves of great men, For then my guiltless blood must cry against ’em <ACTION>. </ACTION> For further life in this world I ne’er hope, Nor will I sue, although the King have mercies More than I dare make faults. 

You few that loved me And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham, His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave	 Is only bitter to him, only dying, Go with me like good angels to my end, And as the long divorce of steel falls on me, Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice, And lift my soul to heaven.—Lead on, a’ God’s name.

LOVELL I do beseech your Grace, for charity, If ever any malice in your heart Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly. 

BUCKINGHAM Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you As I would be forgiven. I forgive all.	 There cannot be those numberless offenses ’Gainst me that I cannot take peace with. No black envy Shall make my grave. Commend me to his Grace. And if he speak of Buckingham, pray tell him	 You met him half in heaven. My vows and prayers Yet are the King’s and, till my soul forsake, Shall cry for blessings on him. May he live Longer than I have time to tell his years. Ever beloved and loving may his rule be;	 And when old Time shall lead him to his end, Goodness and he fill up one monument! 

LOVELL To th’ waterside I must conduct your Grace, Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux, Who undertakes you to your end. 

VAUX ,  <ACTION>calling as to Officers offstage </ACTION> Prepare there! The Duke is coming. See the barge be ready, And fit it with such furniture as suits The greatness of his person. 

BUCKINGHAM  Nay, Sir Nicholas,	 Let it alone. My state now will but mock me. When I came hither, I was Lord High Constable And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun. Yet I am richer than my base accusers, That never knew what truth meant. I now seal it,	 And with that blood will make ’em one day groan for ’t. My noble father, Henry of Buckingham, Who first raised head against usurping Richard, Flying for succor to his servant Banister, Being distressed, was by that wretch betrayed,	 And, without trial, fell. God’s peace be with him. Henry the Seventh, succeeding, truly pitying My father’s loss, like a most royal prince Restored me to my honors and out of ruins Made my name once more noble. Now his son,	 Henry the Eighth, life, honor, name, and all That made me happy at one stroke has taken Forever from the world. I had my trial, And must needs say a noble one, which makes me A little happier than my wretched father. Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both Fell by our servants, by those men we loved most— A most unnatural and faithless service. 

Heaven has an end in all; yet, you that hear me, This from a dying man receive as certain: Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends And give your hearts to, when they once perceive The least rub in your fortunes, fall away Like water from you, never found again	 But where they mean to sink you.All good people, Pray for me. I must now forsake you. The last hour Of my long weary life is come upon me. Farewell. And when you would say something that is sad,	 Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me. 

<ACTION>Duke and train exit.</ACTION> 

FIRST GENTLEMAN O, this is full of pity, sir! It calls, I fear, too many curses on their heads That were the authors. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN If the Duke be guiltless,	 ’Tis full of woe. Yet I can give you inkling Of an ensuing evil, if it fall, Greater than this. 

FIRST GENTLEMAN Good angels keep it from us! What may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir?	 

SECOND GENTLEMAN This secret is so weighty ’twill require A strong faith to conceal it. 

FIRST GENTLEMAN Let me have it. I do not talk much. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN  I am confident;	 You shall, sir. Did you not of late days hear A buzzing of a separation Between the King and Katherine? 

FIRST GENTLEMAN Yes, but it held not; For when the King once heard it, out of anger	 He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight To stop the rumor and allay those tongues That durst disperse it. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN But that slander, sir, Is found a truth now, for it grows again	 Fresher than e’er it was, and held for certain The King will venture at it. Either the Cardinal, Or some about him near, have, out of malice To the good queen, possessed him with a scruple That will undo her. To confirm this too,	 Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately, As all think, for this business. 

FIRST GENTLEMAN ’Tis the Cardinal; And merely to revenge him on the Emperor For not bestowing on him at his asking	 The archbishopric of Toledo this is purposed. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN I think you have hit the mark. But is ’t not cruel That she should feel the smart of this? The Cardinal Will have his will, and she must fall. 

FIRST GENTLEMAN ’Tis woeful.	 We are too open here to argue this. Let’s think in private more. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
