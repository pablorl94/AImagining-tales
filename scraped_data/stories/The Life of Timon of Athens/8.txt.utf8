<ACTION>Enter three Senators at one door, Alcibiades meetingthem, with Attendants.</ACTION> 

FIRST SENATOR ,  <ACTION>to the Second Senator</ACTION> My lord, you have my voice to ’t. The fault’s Bloody. ’Tis necessary he should die. Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy. 

SECOND SENATOR Most true. The law shall bruise ’em. 

ALCIBIADES Honor, health, and compassion to the Senate!	 

FIRST SENATOR Now, captain? 

ALCIBIADES I am an humble suitor to your virtues, For pity is the virtue of the law, And none but tyrants use it cruelly. It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy	 Upon a friend of mine, who in hot blood Hath stepped into the law, which is past depth To those that without heed do plunge into ’t. He is a man—setting his fate aside— Of comely virtues.	 Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice— An honor in him which buys out his fault— But with a noble fury and fair spirit, Seeing his reputation touched to death, He did oppose his foe;	 And with such sober and unnoted passion He did behave his anger, ere ’twas spent, As if he had but proved an argument. 

FIRST SENATOR You undergo too strict a paradox, Striving to make an ugly deed look fair.	 Your words have took such pains as if they labored To bring manslaughter into form and set quarreling Upon the head of valor—which indeed Is valor misbegot, and came into the world When sects and factions were newly born.	 He’s truly valiant that can wisely suffer The worst that man can breathe And make his wrongs his outsides, To wear them like his raiment, carelessly, And ne’er prefer his injuries to his heart	 To bring it into danger. If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill, What folly ’tis to hazard life for ill! 

ALCIBIADES My lord— 

FIRST SENATOR You cannot make gross sins look clear.	 To revenge is no valor, but to bear. 

ALCIBIADES My lords, then, under favor, pardon me If I speak like a captain. Why do fond men expose themselves to battle And not endure all threats? Sleep upon ’t,	 And let the foes quietly cut their throats Without repugnancy? If there be Such valor in the bearing, what make we Abroad? Why, then, women are more valiant That stay at home, if bearing carry it,	 And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon Loaden with irons wiser than the judge, If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords, As you are great, be pitifully good. Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?	 To kill, I grant, is sin’s extremest gust, But in defense, by mercy, ’tis most just. To be in anger is impiety, But who is man that is not angry? Weigh but the crime with this.	 

SECOND SENATOR You breathe in vain. 

ALCIBIADES In vain? His service done At Lacedaemon and Byzantium Were a sufficient briber for his life. 

FIRST SENATOR What’s that?	 

ALCIBIADES Why, I say, my lords, has done fair service And slain in fight many of your enemies. How full of valor did he bear himself In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds! 

SECOND SENATOR He has made too much plenty with ’em.	 He’s a sworn rioter. He has a sin That often drowns him and takes his valor prisoner. If there were no foes, that were enough To overcome him. In that beastly fury, He has been known to commit outrages	 And cherish factions. ’Tis inferred to us His days are foul and his drink dangerous. 

FIRST SENATOR He dies. 

ALCIBIADES Hard fate! He might have died in war. My lords, if not for any parts in him—	 Though his right arm might purchase his own time And be in debt to none—yet, more to move you, Take my deserts to his and join ’em both. And, for I know your reverend ages love Security, I’ll pawn my victories, all	 My honor, to you, upon his good returns. If by this crime he owes the law his life, Why, let the war receive ’t in valiant gore, For law is strict, and war is nothing more. 

FIRST SENATOR We are for law. He dies. Urge it no more,	 On height of our displeasure. Friend or brother, He forfeits his own blood that spills another. 

ALCIBIADES  Must it be so? It must not be. My lords, I do beseech you, know me. 

SECOND SENATOR  How?	 

ALCIBIADES Call me to your remembrances. 

THIRD SENATOR  What? 

ALCIBIADES I cannot think but your age has forgot me. It could not else be I should prove so base To sue and be denied such common grace.	 My wounds ache at you. 

FIRST SENATOR  Do you dare our anger? ’Tis in few words, but spacious in effect: We banish thee forever. 

ALCIBIADES Banish me?	 Banish your dotage, banish usury, That makes the Senate ugly! 

FIRST SENATOR If after two days’ shine Athens contain thee, Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swell our spirit,	 He shall be executed presently.	 

<ACTION>Senators exit.</ACTION> 

ALCIBIADES Now the gods keep you old enough that you may live Only in bone, that none may look on you!— I’m worse than mad. I have kept back their foes While they have told their money and let out	 Their coin upon large interest, I myself Rich only in large hurts. All those for this? Is this the balsam that the usuring Senate Pours into captains’ wounds? Banishment. It comes not ill. I hate not to be banished.	 It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury, That I may strike at Athens. I’ll cheer up My discontented troops and lay for hearts. ’Tis honor with most lands to be at odds. Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.
