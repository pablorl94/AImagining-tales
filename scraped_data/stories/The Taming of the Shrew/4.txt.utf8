<ACTION>Enter Katherine and Bianca with her hands tied.</ACTION> 

BIANCA Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself, To make a bondmaid and a slave of me. That I disdain. But for these other goods— Unbind my hands, I’ll pull them off myself, Yea, all my raiment to my petticoat,	 Or what you will command me will I do, So well I know my duty to my elders. 

KATHERINE Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell Whom thou lov’st best. See thou dissemble not. 

BIANCA Believe me, sister, of all the men alive	 I never yet beheld that special face Which I could fancy more than any other. 

KATHERINE Minion, thou liest. Is ’t not Hortensio? 

BIANCA If you affect him, sister, here I swear I’ll plead for you myself, but you shall have him.	 

KATHERINE O, then belike you fancy riches more. You will have Gremio to keep you fair. 

BIANCA Is it for him you do envy me so? Nay, then, you jest, and now I well perceive You have but jested with me all this while.	 I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands. 

<ACTION>Katherine strikes her.</ACTION> 

KATHERINE If that be jest, then all the rest was so. 

<ACTION>Enter Baptista.</ACTION> 

BAPTISTA Why, how now, dame, whence grows this insolence?— Bianca, stand aside.—Poor girl, she weeps!	 

<ACTION>He unties her hands.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>To Bianca.</ACTION> Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her. 

<ACTION>To Katherine.</ACTION> For shame, thou hilding of a devilish spirit! Why dost thou wrong her that did ne’er wrong thee?	 When did she cross thee with a bitter word? 

KATHERINE Her silence flouts me, and I’ll be revenged! 

<ACTION>She flies after Bianca.</ACTION> 

BAPTISTA What, in my sight?—Bianca, get thee in. 

<ACTION>Bianca exits.</ACTION> 

KATHERINE What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see She is your treasure, she must have a husband,	 I must dance barefoot on her wedding day And, for your love to her, lead apes in hell. Talk not to me. I will go sit and weep Till I can find occasion of revenge.	 

<ACTION>She exits.</ACTION> 

BAPTISTA Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?	 But who comes here? 

<ACTION>Enter Gremio; Lucentio disguised as Cambioin the habit of a mean man; Petruchio withHortensio disguised as Litio; and Tranio disguisedas Lucentio, with his boy, Biondello bearing a luteand books.</ACTION> 

GREMIO Good morrow, neighbor Baptista. 

BAPTISTA Good morrow, neighbor Gremio.—God save you, gentlemen. 

PETRUCHIO And you, good sir. Pray, have you not a daughter	 Called Katherina, fair and virtuous? 

BAPTISTA I have a daughter, sir, called Katherina. 

GREMIO , <ACTION> to Petruchio</ACTION> You are too blunt. Go to it orderly. 

PETRUCHIO You wrong me, Signior Gremio. Give me leave.— I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,	 That hearing of her beauty and her wit, Her affability and bashful modesty, Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior, Am bold to show myself a forward guest Within your house, to make mine eye the witness	 Of that report which I so oft have heard, And, for an entrance to my entertainment, I do present you with a man of mine, <ACTION>(Presenting Hortensio, disguised as Litio)</ACTION> Cunning in music and the mathematics, To instruct her fully in those sciences,	 Whereof I know she is not ignorant. Accept of him, or else you do me wrong. His name is Litio, born in Mantua. 

BAPTISTA You’re welcome, sir, and he for your good sake. But for my daughter Katherine, this I know,	 She is not for your turn, the more my grief. 

PETRUCHIO I see you do not mean to part with her, Or else you like not of my company. 

BAPTISTA Mistake me not. I speak but as I find. Whence are you, sir? What may I call your name?	 

PETRUCHIO Petruchio is my name, Antonio’s son, A man well known throughout all Italy. 

BAPTISTA I know him well. You are welcome for his sake. 

GREMIO Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray Let us that are poor petitioners speak too!	 Bacare, you are marvelous forward. 

PETRUCHIO O, pardon me, Signior Gremio, I would fain be doing. 

GREMIO I doubt it not, sir. But you will curse your wooing. <ACTION>To Baptista.</ACTION> Neighbor, this is a gift very grateful,	 I am sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself, that have been more kindly beholding to you than any, freely give unto you this young scholar ( <ACTION>presentingLucentio, disguised as Cambio)</ACTION> that hath been long studying at Rheims, as cunning in Greek,	 Latin, and other languages as the other in music and mathematics. His name is Cambio. Pray accept his service. 

BAPTISTA A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.—Welcome, good Cambio.  <ACTION>To Tranio as Lucentio. </ACTION> But,	90 gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger. May I be so bold to know the cause of your coming? 

TRANIO ,  <ACTION>as Lucentio</ACTION> Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own, That being a stranger in this city here Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,	 Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous. Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me, In the preferment of the eldest sister. This liberty is all that I request, That, upon knowledge of my parentage,	 I may have welcome ’mongst the rest that woo And free access and favor as the rest. And toward the education of your daughters I here bestow a simple instrument And this small packet of Greek and Latin books.	 <ACTION>Biondello comes forward with the gifts.</ACTION> If you accept them, then their worth is great. 

BAPTISTA Lucentio is your name. Of whence, I pray? 

TRANIO ,  <ACTION>as Lucentio</ACTION> Of Pisa, sir, son to Vincentio. 

BAPTISTA A mighty man of Pisa. By report I know him well. You are very welcome, sir.	 <ACTION>To Hortensio as Litio.</ACTION> Take you the lute, <ACTION>To Lucentio as Cambio.</ACTION> and you the set of books. You shall go see your pupils presently. Holla, within! 

<ACTION>Enter a Servant.</ACTION> 

Sirrah, lead these gentlemen	 To my daughters, and tell them both These are their tutors. Bid them use them well. 

<ACTION>Servant exits with Hortensio and Lucentio.</ACTION> 

We will go walk a little in the orchard, And then to dinner. You are passing welcome, And so I pray you all to think yourselves.	 

PETRUCHIO Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste, And every day I cannot come to woo. You knew my father well, and in him me, Left solely heir to all his lands and goods, Which I have bettered rather than decreased.	 Then tell me, if I get your daughter’s love, What dowry shall I have with her to wife? 

BAPTISTA After my death, the one half of my lands, And, in possession, twenty thousand crowns. 

PETRUCHIO And, for that dowry, I’ll assure her of	130 Her widowhood, be it that she survive me, In all my lands and leases whatsoever. Let specialties be therefore drawn between us, That covenants may be kept on either hand. 

BAPTISTA Ay, when the special thing is well obtained,	135 That is, her love, for that is all in all. 

PETRUCHIO Why, that is nothing. For I tell you, father, I am as peremptory as she proud-minded; And where two raging fires meet together, They do consume the thing that feeds their fury.	 Though little fire grows great with little wind, Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all. So I to her and so she yields to me, For I am rough and woo not like a babe. 

BAPTISTA Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed.	 But be thou armed for some unhappy words. 

PETRUCHIO Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds, That shakes not, though they blow perpetually. 

<ACTION>Enter Hortensio as Litio with his head broke.</ACTION> 

BAPTISTA How now, my friend, why dost thou look so pale? 

HORTENSIO ,  <ACTION>as Litio</ACTION> For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.	 

BAPTISTA What, will my daughter prove a good musician? 

HORTENSIO ,  <ACTION>as Litio</ACTION> I think she’ll sooner prove a soldier! Iron may hold with her, but never lutes. 

BAPTISTA Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute? 

HORTENSIO ,  <ACTION>as Litio</ACTION> Why, no, for she hath broke the lute to me.	 I did but tell her she mistook her frets, And bowed her hand to teach her fingering, When, with a most impatient devilish spirit, ‘Frets’ call you these?” quoth she. “I’ll fume with them!”	 And with that word she struck me on the head, And through the instrument my pate made way, And there I stood amazèd for a while, As on a pillory, looking through the lute, While she did call me “rascal fiddler,”	 And “twangling Jack,” with twenty such vile terms, As had she studied to misuse me so. 

PETRUCHIO Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench. I love her ten times more than ere I did. O, how I long to have some chat with her!	 

BAPTISTA ,  <ACTION>to Hortensio as Litio</ACTION> Well, go with me, and be not so discomfited. Proceed in practice with my younger daughter. She’s apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.— Signior Petruchio, will you go with us, Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?	 

PETRUCHIO I pray you do. I’ll attend her here— 

<ACTION>All but Petruchio exit.</ACTION> 

And woo her with some spirit when she comes! Say that she rail, why then I’ll tell her plain She sings as sweetly as a nightingale. Say that she frown, I’ll say she looks as clear	 As morning roses newly washed with dew. Say she be mute and will not speak a word, Then I’ll commend her volubility And say she uttereth piercing eloquence. If she do bid me pack, I’ll give her thanks	 As though she bid me stay by her a week. If she deny to wed, I’ll crave the day When I shall ask the banns, and when be marrièd. But here she comes—and now, Petruchio, speak. 

<ACTION>Enter Katherine.</ACTION> 

Good morrow, Kate, for that’s your name, I hear.	 

KATHERINE Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing. They call me Katherine that do talk of me. 

PETRUCHIO You lie, in faith, for you are called plain Kate, And bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst. But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom,	 Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate (For dainties are all Kates)—and therefore, Kate, Take this of me, Kate of my consolation: Hearing thy mildness praised in every town, Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded	 (Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs), Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife. 

KATHERINE “Moved,” in good time! Let him that moved you hither Remove you hence. I knew you at the first	 You were a movable. 

PETRUCHIO Why, what’s a movable? 

KATHERINE A joint stool. 

PETRUCHIO Thou hast hit it. Come, sit on me. 

KATHERINE Asses are made to bear, and so are you.	 

PETRUCHIO Women are made to bear, and so are you. 

KATHERINE No such jade as you, if me you mean. 

PETRUCHIO Alas, good Kate, I will not burden thee, For knowing thee to be but young and light— 

KATHERINE Too light for such a swain as you to catch,	 And yet as heavy as my weight should be. 

PETRUCHIO “Should be”—should buzz! 

KATHERINE Well ta’en, and like a buzzard. 

PETRUCHIO O slow-winged turtle, shall a buzzard take thee?	 

KATHERINE Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard. 

PETRUCHIO Come, come, you wasp! I’ faith, you are too angry. 

KATHERINE If I be waspish, best beware my sting. 

PETRUCHIO My remedy is then to pluck it out. 

KATHERINE Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.	 

PETRUCHIO Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail. 

KATHERINE  In his tongue. 

PETRUCHIO Whose tongue? 

KATHERINE Yours, if you talk of tales, and so farewell.	 

PETRUCHIO  What, with my tongue in your tail? Nay, come again, good Kate. I am a gentleman— 

KATHERINE That I’ll try.	 

<ACTION>She strikes him.</ACTION> 

PETRUCHIO I swear I’ll cuff you if you strike again. 

KATHERINE So may you lose your arms.	 If you strike me, you are no gentleman, And if no gentleman, why then no arms. 

PETRUCHIO A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books. 

KATHERINE What is your crest? A coxcomb? 

PETRUCHIO A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.	 

KATHERINE No cock of mine. You crow too like a craven. 

PETRUCHIO Nay, come, Kate, come. You must not look so sour. 

KATHERINE It is my fashion when I see a crab. 

PETRUCHIO Why, here’s no crab, and therefore look not sour. 

KATHERINE There is, there is.	 

PETRUCHIO Then show it me. 

KATHERINE Had I a glass, I would. 

PETRUCHIO What, you mean my face? 

KATHERINE Well aimed of such a young one. 

PETRUCHIO Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.	 

KATHERINE Yet you are withered. 

PETRUCHIO ’Tis with cares. 

KATHERINE I care not. 

PETRUCHIO Nay, hear you, Kate—in sooth, you ’scape not so. 

KATHERINE I chafe you if I tarry. Let me go.	 

PETRUCHIO No, not a whit. I find you passing gentle. ’Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen, And now I find report a very liar. For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,	 But slow in speech, yet sweet as springtime flowers. Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance, Nor bite the lip as angry wenches will, Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk. But thou with mildness entertain’st thy wooers,	 With gentle conference, soft, and affable. Why does the world report that Kate doth limp? O sland’rous world! Kate like the hazel twig Is straight, and slender, and as brown in hue As hazelnuts, and sweeter than the kernels.	 O, let me see thee walk! Thou dost not halt. 

KATHERINE Go, fool, and whom thou keep’st command. 

PETRUCHIO Did ever Dian so become a grove As Kate this chamber with her princely gait? O, be thou Dian and let her be Kate,	 And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful. 

KATHERINE Where did you study all this goodly speech? 

PETRUCHIO It is extempore, from my mother wit. 

KATHERINE A witty mother, witless else her son. 

PETRUCHIO Am I not wise?	 

KATHERINE Yes, keep you warm. 

PETRUCHIO Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed. And therefore, setting all this chat aside, Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented That you shall be my wife, your dowry ’greed on,	 And, will you, nill you, I will marry you. Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn, For by this light, whereby I see thy beauty, Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well, Thou must be married to no man but me.	 For I am he am born to tame you, Kate, And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate Conformable as other household Kates. 

<ACTION>Enter Baptista, Gremio, and Tranio as Lucentio.</ACTION> 

Here comes your father. Never make denial. I must and will have Katherine to my wife.	 

BAPTISTA Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter? 

PETRUCHIO How but well, sir? How but well? It were impossible I should speed amiss. 

BAPTISTA Why, how now, daughter Katherine? In your	 dumps? 

KATHERINE Call you me daughter? Now I promise you You have showed a tender fatherly regard, To wish me wed to one half lunatic, A madcap ruffian and a swearing Jack,	 That thinks with oaths to face the matter out. 

PETRUCHIO Father, ’tis thus: yourself and all the world That talked of her have talked amiss of her. If she be curst, it is for policy, For she’s not froward, but modest as the dove;	 She is not hot, but temperate as the morn. For patience she will prove a second Grissel, And Roman Lucrece for her chastity. And to conclude, we have ’greed so well together That upon Sunday is the wedding day.	 

KATHERINE I’ll see thee hanged on Sunday first. 

GREMIO Hark, Petruchio, she says she’ll see thee hanged first. 

TRANIO ,  <ACTION>as Lucentio</ACTION> Is this your speeding? Nay, then, goodnight our part.	 

PETRUCHIO Be patient, gentlemen. I choose her for myself. If she and I be pleased, what’s that to you? ’Tis bargained ’twixt us twain, being alone, That she shall still be curst in company. I tell you, ’tis incredible to believe	 How much she loves me. O, the kindest Kate! She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath, That in a twink she won me to her love. O, you are novices! ’Tis a world to see	 How tame, when men and women are alone, A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.— Give me thy hand, Kate. I will unto Venice To buy apparel ’gainst the wedding day.— Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests.	335 I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine. 

BAPTISTA I know not what to say, but give me your hands. God send you joy, Petruchio. ’Tis a match. 

GREMIO AND TRANIO ,  <ACTION>as Lucentio</ACTION> Amen, say we. We will be witnesses. 

PETRUCHIO Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.	 I will to Venice. Sunday comes apace. We will have rings, and things, and fine array, And kiss me, Kate. We will be married o’ Sunday. 

<ACTION>Petruchio and Katherine exitthrough different doors.</ACTION> 

GREMIO Was ever match clapped up so suddenly? 

BAPTISTA Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant’s part	 And venture madly on a desperate mart. 

TRANIO ,  <ACTION>as Lucentio</ACTION> ’Twas a commodity lay fretting by you. ’Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas. 

BAPTISTA The gain I seek, is quiet in the match. 

GREMIO No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.	 But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter. Now is the day we long have lookèd for. I am your neighbor and was suitor first. 

TRANIO ,  <ACTION>as Lucentio</ACTION> And I am one that love Bianca more Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess.	 

GREMIO Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I. 

TRANIO ,  <ACTION>as Lucentio</ACTION> Graybeard, thy love doth freeze. 

GREMIO But thine doth fry! Skipper, stand back. ’Tis age that nourisheth. 

TRANIO ,  <ACTION>as Lucentio</ACTION> But youth in ladies’ eyes that flourisheth.	 

BAPTISTA Content you, gentlemen. I will compound this strife. ’Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both That can assure my daughter greatest dower Shall have my Bianca’s love. Say, Signior Gremio, what can you assure her?	 

GREMIO First, as you know, my house within the city Is richly furnishèd with plate and gold, Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands; My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry; In ivory coffers I have stuffed my crowns,	 In cypress chests my arras counterpoints, Costly apparel, tents, and canopies, Fine linen, Turkey cushions bossed with pearl, Valance of Venice gold in needlework, Pewter and brass, and all things that belongs	 To house or housekeeping. Then, at my farm I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail, Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls, And all things answerable to this portion. Myself am struck in years, I must confess,	 And if I die tomorrow this is hers, If whilst I live she will be only mine. 

TRANIO ,  <ACTION>as Lucentio</ACTION> That “only” came well in.  <ACTION>To Baptista. </ACTION> Sir, list to me: I am my father’s heir and only son.	 If I may have your daughter to my wife, I’ll leave her houses three or four as good, Within rich Pisa walls, as any one Old Signior Gremio has in Padua, Besides two thousand ducats by the year	390 Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.— What, have I pinched you, Signior Gremio? 

GREMIO Two thousand ducats by the year of land? Aside. My land amounts not to so much in all.— That she shall have, besides an argosy	 That now is lying in Marcellus’ road. <ACTION>To Tranio.</ACTION> What, have I choked you with an argosy? 

TRANIO ,  <ACTION>as Lucentio</ACTION> Gremio, ’tis known my father hath no less Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses And twelve tight galleys. These I will assure her,	 And twice as much whate’er thou off’rest next. 

GREMIO Nay, I have offered all. I have no more, And she can have no more than all I have. <ACTION>To Baptista.</ACTION> If you like me, she shall have me and mine.	 

TRANIO , <ACTION> as Lucentio</ACTION> Why, then, the maid is mine from all the world, By your firm promise. Gremio is outvied. 

BAPTISTA I must confess your offer is the best, And, let your father make her the assurance, She is your own; else, you must pardon me.	 If you should die before him, where’s her dower? 

TRANIO ,  <ACTION>as Lucentio</ACTION> That’s but a cavil. He is old, I young. 

GREMIO And may not young men die as well as old? 

BAPTISTA Well, gentlemen, I am thus resolved: On Sunday next, you know	 My daughter Katherine is to be married. <ACTION>To Tranio as Lucentio.</ACTION> Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca Be bride to you, if you make this assurance. If not, to Signior Gremio.	 And so I take my leave, and thank you both. 

GREMIO Adieu, good neighbor.	 

<ACTION>Baptista exits.</ACTION> 

Now I fear thee not. Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool To give thee all and in his waning age	 Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy! An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy. 

<ACTION>Gremio exits.</ACTION> 

TRANIO A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!— Yet I have faced it with a card of ten. ’Tis in my head to do my master good.	 I see no reason but supposed Lucentio Must get a father, called “supposed Vincentio”— And that’s a wonder. Fathers commonly Do get their children. But in this case of wooing, A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
