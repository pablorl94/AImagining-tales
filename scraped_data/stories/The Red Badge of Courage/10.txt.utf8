CHAPTER XI. 

He became aware that the furnace roar of the battle was growing louder. Great brown clouds had floated to the still heights of air before him. The noise, too, was approaching.  The woods filtered men and the fields became dotted. 

As he rounded a hillock, he perceived that the roadway was now a crying mass of wagons, teams, and men.  From the heaving tangle issued exhortations, commands, imprecations.  Fear was sweeping it all along. The cracking whips bit and horses plunged and tugged.  The white-topped wagons strained and stumbled in their exertions like fat sheep. 

The youth felt comforted in a measure by this sight.  They were all retreating.  Perhaps, then, he was not so bad after all.  He seated himself and watched the terror-stricken wagons.  They fled like soft, ungainly animals.  All the roarers and lashers served to help him to magnify the dangers and horrors of the engagement that he might try to prove to himself that the thing with which men could charge him was in truth a symmetrical act.  There was an amount of pleasure to him in watching the wild march of this vindication. 

Presently the calm head of a forward-going column of infantry appeared in the road.  It came swiftly on.  Avoiding the obstructions gave it the sinuous movement of a serpent.  The men at the head butted mules with their musket stocks.  They prodded teamsters indifferent to all howls.  The men forced their way through parts of the dense mass by strength.  The blunt head of the column pushed.  The raving teamsters swore many strange oaths. 

The commands to make way had the ring of a great importance in them. The men were going forward to the heart of the din.  They were to confront the eager rush of the enemy.  They felt the pride of their onward movement when the remainder of the army seemed trying to dribble down this road.  They tumbled teams about with a fine feeling that it was no matter so long as their column got to the front in time.  This importance made their faces grave and stern. And the backs of the officers were very rigid. 

As the youth looked at them the black weight of his woe returned to him.  He felt that he was regarding a procession of chosen beings.  The separation was as great to him as if they had marched with weapons of flame and banners of sunlight.  He could never be like them.  He could have wept in his longings. 

He searched about in his mind for an adequate malediction for the indefinite cause, the thing upon which men turn the words of final blame.  It--whatever it was--was responsible for him, he said.  There lay the fault. 

The haste of the column to reach the battle seemed to the forlorn young man to be something much finer than stout fighting.  Heroes, he thought, could find excuses in that long seething lane.  They could retire with perfect self-respect and make excuses to the stars. 

He wondered what those men had eaten that they could be in such haste to force their way to grim chances of death.  As he watched his envy grew until he thought that he wished to change lives with one of them. He would have liked to have used a tremendous force, he said, throw off himself and become a better.  Swift pictures of himself, apart, yet in himself, came to him--a blue desperate figure leading lurid charges with one knee forward and a broken blade high--a blue, determined figure standing before a crimson and steel assault, getting calmly killed on a high place before the eyes of all.  He thought of the magnificent pathos of his dead body. 

These thoughts uplifted him.  He felt the quiver of war desire.  In his ears, he heard the ring of victory.  He knew the frenzy of a rapid successful charge.  The music of the trampling feet, the sharp voices, the clanking arms of the column near him made him soar on the red wings of war.  For a few moments he was sublime. 

He thought that he was about to start for the front.  Indeed, he saw a picture of himself, dust-stained, haggard, panting, flying to the front at the proper moment to seize and throttle the dark, leering witch of calamity. 

Then the difficulties of the thing began to drag at him.  He hesitated, balancing awkwardly on one foot. 

He had no rifle; he could not fight with his hands, said he resentfully to his plan.  Well, rifles could be had for the picking.  They were extraordinarily profuse. 

Also, he continued, it would be a miracle if he found his regiment. Well, he could fight with any regiment. 

He started forward slowly.  He stepped as if he expected to tread upon some explosive thing. Doubts and he were struggling. 

He would truly be a worm if any of his comrades should see him returning thus, the marks of his flight upon him.  There was a reply that the intent fighters did not care for what happened rearward saving that no hostile bayonets appeared there.  In the battle-blur his face would, in a way be hidden, like the face of a cowled man. 

But then he said that his tireless fate would bring forth, when the strife lulled for a moment, a man to ask of him an explanation.  In imagination he felt the scrutiny of his companions as he painfully labored through some lies. 

Eventually, his courage expended itself upon these objections.  The debates drained him of his fire. 

He was not cast down by this defeat of his plan, for, upon studying the affair carefully, he could not but admit that the objections were very formidable. 

Furthermore, various ailments had begun to cry out.  In their presence he could not persist in flying high with the wings of war; they rendered it almost impossible for him to see himself in a heroic light. He tumbled headlong. 

He discovered that he had a scorching thirst. His face was so dry and grimy that he thought he could feel his skin crackle.  Each bone of his body had an ache in it, and seemingly threatened to break with each movement.  His feet were like two sores.  Also, his body was calling for food.  It was more powerful than a direct hunger. There was a dull, weight like feeling in his stomach, and, when he tried to walk, his head swayed and he tottered.  He could not see with distinctness. Small patches of green mist floated before his vision. 

While he had been tossed by many emotions, he had not been aware of ailments.  Now they beset him and made clamor.  As he was at last compelled to pay attention to them, his capacity for self-hate was multiplied.  In despair, he declared that he was not like those others. He now conceded it to be impossible that he should ever become a hero. He was a craven loon. Those pictures of glory were piteous things.  He groaned from his heart and went staggering off. 

A certain mothlike quality within him kept him in the vicinity of the battle.  He had a great desire to see, and to get news.  He wished to know who was winning. 

He told himself that, despite his unprecedented suffering, he had never lost his greed for a victory, yet, he said, in a half-apologetic manner to his conscience, he could not but know that a defeat for the army this time might mean many favorable things for him.  The blows of the enemy would splinter regiments into fragments.  Thus, many men of courage, he considered, would be obliged to desert the colors and scurry like chickens.  He would appear as one of them. They would be sullen brothers in distress, and he could then easily believe he had not run any farther or faster than they.  And if he himself could believe in his virtuous perfection, he conceived that there would be small trouble in convincing all others. 

He said, as if in excuse for this hope, that previously the army had encountered great defeats and in a few months had shaken off all blood and tradition of them, emerging as bright and valiant as a new one; thrusting out of sight the memory of disaster, and appearing with the valor and confidence of unconquered legions. The shrilling voices of the people at home would pipe dismally for a time, but various generals were usually compelled to listen to these ditties. He of course felt no compunctions for proposing a general as a sacrifice.  He could not tell who the chosen for the barbs might be, so he could center no direct sympathy upon him.  The people were afar and he did not conceive public opinion to be accurate at long range.  It was quite probable they would hit the wrong man who, after he had recovered from his amazement would perhaps spend the rest of his days in writing replies to the songs of his alleged failure.  It would be very unfortunate, no doubt, but in this case a general was of no consequence to the youth. 

In a defeat there would be a roundabout vindication of himself.  He thought it would prove, in a manner, that he had fled early because of his superior powers of perception.  A serious prophet upon predicting a flood should be the first man to climb a tree.  This would demonstrate that he was indeed a seer. 

A moral vindication was regarded by the youth as a very important thing.  Without salve, he could not, he thought, wear the sore badge of his dishonor through life.  With his heart continually assuring him that he was despicable, he could not exist without making it, through his actions, apparent to all men. 

If the army had gone gloriously on he would be lost.  If the din meant that now his army's flags were tilted forward he was a condemned wretch.  He would be compelled to doom himself to isolation.  If the men were advancing, their indifferent feet were trampling upon his chances for a successful life. 

As these thoughts went rapidly through his mind, he turned upon them and tried to thrust them away.  He denounced himself as a villain. He said that he was the most unutterably selfish man in existence.  His mind pictured the soldiers who would place their defiant bodies before the spear of the yelling battle fiend, and as he saw their dripping corpses on an imagined field, he said that he was their murderer. 

Again he thought that he wished he was dead. He believed that he envied a corpse.  Thinking of the slain, he achieved a great contempt for some of them, as if they were guilty for thus becoming lifeless.  They might have been killed by lucky chances, he said, before they had had opportunities to flee or before they had been really tested.  Yet they would receive laurels from tradition.  He cried out bitterly that their crowns were stolen and their robes of glorious memories were shams. However, he still said that it was a great pity he was not as they. 

A defeat of the army had suggested itself to him as a means of escape from the consequences of his fall.  He considered, now, however, that it was useless to think of such a possibility.  His education had been that success for that mighty blue machine was certain; that it would make victories as a contrivance turns out buttons.  He presently discarded all his speculations in the other direction.  He returned to the creed of soldiers. 

When he perceived again that it was not possible for the army to be defeated, he tried to bethink him of a fine tale which he could take back to his regiment, and with it turn the expected shafts of derision. 

But, as he mortally feared these shafts, it became impossible for him to invent a tale he felt he could trust.  He experimented with many schemes, but threw them aside one by one as flimsy.  He was quick to see vulnerable places in them all. 

Furthermore, he was much afraid that some arrow of scorn might lay him mentally low before he could raise his protecting tale. 

He imagined the whole regiment saying: "Where's Henry Fleming?  He run, didn't 'e? Oh, my!"  He recalled various persons who would be quite sure to leave him no peace about it.  They would doubtless question him with sneers, and laugh at his stammering hesitation.  In the next engagement they would try to keep watch of him to discover when he would run. 

Wherever he went in camp, he would encounter insolent and lingeringly cruel stares.  As he imagined himself passing near a crowd of comrades, he could hear some one say, "There he goes!" 

Then, as if the heads were moved by one muscle, all the faces were turned toward him with wide, derisive grins.  He seemed to hear some one make a humorous remark in a low tone. At it the others all crowed and cackled.  He was a slang phrase.
