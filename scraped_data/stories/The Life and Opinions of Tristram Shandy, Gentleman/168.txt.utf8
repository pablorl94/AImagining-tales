Chapter 3.LI. 

The Story of Le Fever Continued. 

It was to my uncle Toby's eternal honour,--though I tell it only for the sake of those, who, when coop'd in betwixt a natural and a positive law, know not, for their souls, which way in the world to turn themselves--That notwithstanding my uncle Toby was warmly engaged at that time in carrying on the siege of Dendermond, parallel with the allies, who pressed theirs on so vigorously, that they scarce allowed him time to get his dinner--that nevertheless he gave up Dendermond, though he had already made a lodgment upon the counterscarp;--and bent his whole thoughts towards the private distresses at the inn; and except that he ordered the garden gate to be bolted up, by which he might be said to have turned the siege of Dendermond into a blockade,--he left Dendermond to itself--to be relieved or not by the French king, as the French king thought good; and only considered how he himself should relieve the poor lieutenant and his son. 

--That kind Being, who is a friend to the friendless, shall recompence thee for this. 

Thou hast left this matter short, said my uncle Toby to the corporal, as he was putting him to bed,--and I will tell thee in what, Trim.--In the first place, when thou madest an offer of my services to Le Fever,--as sickness and travelling are both expensive, and thou knowest he was but a poor lieutenant, with a son to subsist as well as himself out of his pay,--that thou didst not make an offer to him of my purse; because, had he stood in need, thou knowest, Trim, he had been as welcome to it as myself.--Your honour knows, said the corporal, I had no orders;--True, quoth my uncle Toby,--thou didst very right, Trim, as a soldier,--but certainly very wrong as a man. 

In the second place, for which, indeed, thou hast the same excuse, continued my uncle Toby,--when thou offeredst him whatever was in my house,--thou shouldst have offered him my house too:--A sick brother officer should have the best quarters, Trim, and if we had him with us,--we could tend and look to him:--Thou art an excellent nurse thyself, Trim,--and what with thy care of him, and the old woman's and his boy's, and mine together, we might recruit him again at once, and set him upon his legs.-- 

--In a fortnight or three weeks, added my uncle Toby, smiling,--he might march.--He will never march; an' please your honour, in this world, said the corporal:--He will march; said my uncle Toby, rising up from the side of the bed, with one shoe off:--An' please your honour, said the corporal, he will never march but to his grave:--He shall march, cried my uncle Toby, marching the foot which had a shoe on, though without advanceing an inch,--he shall march to his regiment.--He cannot stand it, said the corporal;--He shall be supported, said my uncle Toby;--He'll drop at last, said the corporal, and what will become of his boy?--He shall not drop, said my uncle Toby, firmly.--A-well-o'day,--do what we can for him, said Trim, maintaining his point,--the poor soul will die:--He shall not die, by G.., cried my uncle Toby. 

--The Accusing Spirit, which flew up to heaven's chancery with the oath, blush'd as he gave it in;--and the Recording Angel, as he wrote it down, dropp'd a tear upon the word, and blotted it out for ever.
