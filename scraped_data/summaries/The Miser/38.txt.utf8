Harpagon comes onstage with a police officer. The officer brags that he has sent many thieves to be hanged over the years, and that he'll surely catch this one.

The officer asks if Harpagon has any suspects, and Harpagon says everybody. In many performances, Harpagon turns to the crowd at this point and accuses them.

The officer advises Harpagon not to go around interrogating everyone, but to gently prod people for evidence in order to build a case. Also, maybe he should take a cold shower or something to stop flipping out so absolutely.
