Chapter 3.LXXXII. 

As Susannah was informed by an express from Mrs. Bridget, of my uncle Toby's falling in love with her mistress fifteen days before it happened,--the contents of which express, Susannah communicated to my mother the next day,--it has just given me an opportunity of entering upon my uncle Toby's amours a fortnight before their existence. 

I have an article of news to tell you, Mr. Shandy, quoth my mother, which will surprise you greatly.--

--To be sure, said my mother: so here ended the proposition--the reply,--and the rejoinder, I told you of. 

It will be some amusement to him, too,--said my father. 

A very great one, answered my mother, if he should have children.--
