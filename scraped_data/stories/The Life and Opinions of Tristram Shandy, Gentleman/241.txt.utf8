Chapter 4.XXII. 

No matter how, or in what mood--but I flew from the tomb of the lovers--or rather I did not fly from it--(for there was no such thing existing) and just got time enough to the boat to save my passage;--and ere I had sailed a hundred yards, the Rhone and the Saon met together, and carried me down merrily betwixt them. 

But I have described this voyage down the Rhone, before I made it-- 

--So now I am at Avignon, and as there is nothing to see but the old house, in which the duke of Ormond resided, and nothing to stop me but a short remark upon the place, in three minutes you will see me crossing the bridge upon a mule, with Francois upon a horse with my portmanteau behind him, and the owner of both, striding the way before us, with a long gun upon his shoulder, and a sword under his arm, lest peradventure we should run away with his cattle. Had you seen my breeches in entering Avignon,--Though you'd have seen them better, I think, as I mounted--you would not have thought the precaution amiss, or found in your heart to have taken it in dudgeon; for my own part, I took it most kindly; and determined to make him a present of them, when we got to the end of our journey, for the trouble they had put him to, of arming himself at all points against them. 

Before I go further, let me get rid of my remark upon Avignon, which is this: That I think it wrong, merely because a man's hat has been blown off his head by chance the first night he comes to Avignon,--that he should therefore say, 'Avignon is more subject to high winds than any town in all France:' for which reason I laid no stress upon the accident till I had enquired of the master of the inn about it, who telling me seriously it was so--and hearing, moreover, the windiness of Avignon spoke of in the country about as a proverb--I set it down, merely to ask the learned what can be the cause--the consequence I saw--for they are all Dukes, Marquisses, and Counts, there--the duce a Baron, in all Avignon--so that there is scarce any talking to them on a windy day. 

Prithee, friend, said I, take hold of my mule for a moment--for I wanted to pull off one of my jack-boots, which hurt my heel--the man was standing quite idle at the door of the inn, and as I had taken it into my head, he was someway concerned about the house or stable, I put the bridle into his hand--so begun with the boot:--when I had finished the affair, I turned about to take the mule from the man, and thank him-- 

--But Monsieur le Marquis had walked in--
