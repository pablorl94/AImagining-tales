<ACTION>Enter Caesar, Agrippa, Thidias, andDolabella, with others.</ACTION> 

CAESAR Let him appear that’s come from Antony. Know you him? 

DOLABELLA Caesar, ’tis his schoolmaster— An argument that he is plucked, when hither He sends so poor a pinion of his wing,	 Which had superfluous kings for messengers Not many moons gone by. 

<ACTION>Enter Ambassador from Antony.</ACTION> 

CAESAR Approach, and speak. 

AMBASSADOR Such as I am, I come from Antony. I was of late as petty to his ends	 As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf To his grand sea. 

CAESAR Be ’t so. Declare thine office. 

AMBASSADOR Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and Requires to live in Egypt, which not granted,	 He lessens his requests, and to thee sues To let him breathe between the heavens and Earth, A private man in Athens. This for him. Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness, Submits her to thy might, and of thee craves	 The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs, Now hazarded to thy grace. 

CAESAR For Antony, I have no ears to his request. The Queen Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she	 From Egypt drive her all-disgracèd friend, Or take his life there. This if she perform, She shall not sue unheard. So to them both. 

AMBASSADOR Fortune pursue thee! 

CAESAR Bring him through the bands.	 

<ACTION>Ambassador exits, with Attendants.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>To Thidias. </ACTION> To try thy eloquence now ’tis time. Dispatch. From Antony win Cleopatra. Promise, And in our name, what she requires; add more, From thine invention, offers. Women are not	 In their best fortunes strong, but want will perjure The ne’er-touched vestal. Try thy cunning, Thidias. Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we Will answer as a law. 

THIDIAS Caesar, I go.	 

CAESAR Observe how Antony becomes his flaw, And what thou think’st his very action speaks In every power that moves. 

THIDIAS Caesar, I shall. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
