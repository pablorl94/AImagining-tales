Chapter 3.CII. 

In mentioning the word gay (as in the close of the last chapter) it puts one (i.e. an author) in mind of the word spleen--especially if he has any thing to say upon it: not that by any analysis--or that from any table of interest or genealogy, there appears much more ground of alliance betwixt them, than betwixt light and darkness, or any two of the most unfriendly opposites in nature--only 'tis an undercraft of authors to keep up a good understanding amongst words, as politicians do amongst men--not knowing how near they may be under a necessity of placing them to each other--which point being now gain'd, and that I may place mine exactly to my mind, I write it down here-- 

Spleen. 

This, upon leaving Chantilly, I declared to be the best principle in the world to travel speedily upon; but I gave it only as matter of opinion. I still continue in the same sentiments--only I had not then experience enough of its working to add this, that though you do get on at a tearing rate, yet you get on but uneasily to yourself at the same time; for which reason I here quit it entirely, and for ever, and 'tis heartily at any one's service--it has spoiled me the digestion of a good supper, and brought on a bilious diarrhoea, which has brought me back again to my first principle on which I set out--and with which I shall now scamper it away to the banks of the Garonne-- 

--No;--I cannot stop a moment to give you the character of the people--their genius--their manners--their customs--their laws--their religion--their government--their manufactures--their commerce--their finances, with all the resources and hidden springs which sustain them: qualified as I may be, by spending three days and two nights amongst them, and during all that time making these things the entire subject of my enquiries and reflections-- 

Still--still I must away--the roads are paved--the posts are short--the days are long--'tis no more than noon--I shall be at Fontainebleau before the king-- 

--Was he going there? not that I know--

THE LIFE AND OPINIONS OF TRISTRAM SHANDY, GENT.--VOLUME THE FOURTH. 

Non enim excursus hic ejus, sed opus ipsum est. 

Plin. Lib. V. Epist. 6. 

Si quid urbaniuscule lusum a nobis, per Musas et Charitas et omnium poetarum Numina, Oro te, ne me male capias. 

A Dedication to a Great Man. 

Having, a priori, intended to dedicate The Amours of my Uncle Toby to Mr. ...--I see more reasons, a posteriori, for doing it to Lord........ 

I should lament from my soul, if this exposed me to the jealousy of their Reverences; because a posteriori, in Court-latin, signifies the kissing hands for preferment--or any thing else--in order to get it. 

My opinion of Lord....... is neither better nor worse, than it was of Mr. .... Honours, like impressions upon coin, may give an ideal and local value to a bit of base metal; but Gold and Silver will pass all the world over without any other recommendation than their own weight. 

The same good-will that made me think of offering up half an hour's amusement to Mr.... when out of place--operates more forcibly at present, as half an hour's amusement will be more serviceable and refreshing after labour and sorrow, than after a philosophical repast. 

Nothing is so perfectly amusement as a total change of ideas; no ideas are so totally different as those of Ministers, and innocent Lovers: for which reason, when I come to talk of Statesmen and Patriots, and set such marks upon them as will prevent confusion and mistakes concerning them for the future--I propose to dedicate that Volume to some gentle Shepherd, 

Whose thoughts proud Science never taught to stray, Far as the Statesman's walk or Patriot-way; Yet simple Nature to his hopes had given Out of a cloud-capp'd head a humbler heaven; Some untam'd World in depths of wood embraced-- Some happier Island in the wat'ry-waste-- And where admitted to that equal sky, His faithful Dogs should bear him company. 

In a word, by thus introducing an entire new set of objects to his Imagination, I shall unavoidably give a Diversion to his passionate and love-sick Contemplations. In the mean time, 

I am 

The Author.
