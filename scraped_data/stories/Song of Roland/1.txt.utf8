Merry and bold is now that Emperour, Cordres he holds, the walls are tumbled down, His catapults have battered town and tow'r. Great good treasure his knights have placed in pound, Silver and gold and many a jewelled gown. In that city there is no pagan now But he been slain, or takes the Christian vow. The Emperour is in a great orchard ground Where Oliver and Rollant stand around, Sansun the Duke and Anseis the proud, Gefreid d'Anjou, that bears his gonfaloun; There too Gerin and Geriers are found. Where they are found, is seen a mighty crowd, Fifteen thousand, come out of France the Douce. On white carpets those knights have sate them down, At the game-boards to pass an idle hour;-- Chequers the old, for wisdom most renowned, While fence the young and lusty bachelours. Beneath a pine, in eglantine embow'red, l    Stands a fald-stool, fashioned of gold throughout; There sits the King, that holds Douce France in pow'r; White is his beard, and blossoming-white his crown, Shapely his limbs, his countenance is proud. Should any seek, no need to point him out. The messengers, on foot they get them down, And in salute full courteously they lout.

The foremost word of all Blancandrin spake, And to the King: "May God preserve you safe, The All Glorious, to Whom ye're bound to pray! Proud Marsilies this message bids me say: Much hath he sought to find salvation's way; Out of his wealth meet presents would he make, Lions and bears, and greyhounds leashed on chain, Thousand mewed hawks, sev'n hundred dromedrays, Four hundred mules his silver shall convey, Fifty wagons you'll need to bear away Golden besants, such store of proved assay, Wherewith full tale your soldiers you can pay. Now in this land you've been too long a day Hie you to France, return again to Aix; Thus saith my Lord, he'll follow too that way." That Emperour t'wards God his arms he raised Lowered his head, began to meditate. AOI. 

X 

That Emperour inclined his head full low; Hasty in speech he never was, but slow: His custom was, at his leisure he spoke. When he looks up, his face is very bold, He says to them: "Good tidings have you told. King Marsilies hath ever been my foe. These very words you have before me told, In what measure of faith am I to hold?" That Sarrazin says, "Hostages he'll show; Ten shall you take, or fifteen or a score. Though he be slain, a son of mine shall go, Any there be you'll have more nobly born. To your palace seigneurial when you go, At Michael's Feast, called in periculo; My Lord hath said, thither will he follow Ev'n to your baths, that God for you hath wrought; There is he fain the Christian faith to know." Answers him Charles: "Still may he heal his soul." AOI. 

XI 

Clear shone the sun in a fair even-tide; Those ten men's mules in stall he bade them tie. Also a tent in the orchard raise on high, Those messengers had lodging for the night; Dozen serjeants served after them aright. Darkling they lie till comes the clear daylight. That Emperour does with the morning rise; Matins and Mass are said then in his sight. Forth goes that King, and stays beneath a pine; Barons he calls, good counsel to define, For with his Franks he's ever of a mind. AOI. 

XII 

That Emperour, beneath a pine he sits, Calls his barons, his council to begin: Oger the Duke, that Archbishop Turpin, Richard the old, and his nephew Henry, From Gascony the proof Count Acolin, Tedbald of Reims and Milun his cousin: With him there were Gerers, also Gerin, And among them the Count Rollant came in, And Oliver, so proof and so gentil. Franks out of France, a thousand chivalry; Guenes came there, that wrought the treachery. The Council then began, which ended ill. AOI. 

XIII 

"My Lords Barons," says the Emperour then, Charles, "King Marsilies hath sent me his messages; Out of his wealth he'll give me weighty masses. Greyhounds on leash and bears and lions also, Thousand mewed hawks and seven hundred camels, Four hundred mules with gold Arabian charged, Fifty wagons, yea more than fifty drawing. But into France demands he my departure; He'll follow me to Aix, where is my Castle; There he'll receive the law of our Salvation: Christian he'll be, and hold from me his marches. But I know not what purpose in his heart is." Then say the Franks: "Beseems us act with caution!" AOI. 

XIV 

That Emperour hath ended now his speech. The Count Rollanz, he never will agree, Quick to reply, he springs upon his feet; And to the King, "Believe not Marsilie. Seven years since, when into Spain came we, I conquer'd you Noples also Commibles, And took Valterne, and all the land of Pine, And Balaguet, and Tuele, and Sezilie. Traitor in all his ways was Marsilies; Of his pagans he sent you then fifteen, Bearing in hand their olive-branches green: Who, ev'n as now, these very words did speak. You of your Franks a Council did decree, Praised they your words that foolish were in deed. Two of your Counts did to the pagan speed, Basan was one, and the other Basilie: Their heads he took on th' hill by Haltilie. War have you waged, so on to war proceed, To Sarraguce lead forth your great army. All your life long, if need be, lie in siege, Vengeance for those the felon slew to wreak." AOI. 

XV 

That Emperour he sits with lowering front, He clasps his chin, his beard his fingers tug, Good word nor bad, his nephew not one. Franks hold their peace, but only Guenelun Springs to his feet, and comes before Carlun; Right haughtily his reason he's begun, And to the King: "Believe not any one, My word nor theirs, save whence your good shall come. Since he sends word, that King Marsiliun, Homage he'll do, by finger and by thumb; Throughout all Spain your writ alone shall run Next he'll receive our rule of Christendom Who shall advise, this bidding be not done, Deserves not death, since all to death must come. Counsel of pride is wrong: we've fought enough. Leave we the fools, and with the wise be one." AOI. 

XVI 

And after him came Neimes out, the third, Better vassal there was not in the world; And to the King: "Now rightly have you heard Guenes the Count, what answer he returned. Wisdom was there, but let it well be heard. King Marsilies in war is overturned, His castles all in ruin have you hurled, With catapults his ramparts have you burst, Vanquished his men, and all his cities burned; Him who entreats your pity do not spurn, Sinners were they that would to war return; With hostages his faith he would secure; Let this great war no longer now endure." "Well said the Duke."  Franks utter in their turn. AOI. 

XVII 

"My lords barons, say whom shall we send up To Sarraguce, to King Marsiliun?" Answers Duke Neimes: "I'll go there for your love; Give me therefore the wand, also the glove." Answers the King: "Old man of wisdom pruff; By this white beard, and as these cheeks are rough, You'll not this year so far from me remove; Go sit you down, for none hath called you up." 

XVIII 

"My lords barons, say whom now can we send To th' Sarrazin that Sarraguce defends?" Answers Rollanz: "I might go very well." "Certes, you'll not," says Oliver his friend, "For your courage is fierce unto the end, I am afraid you would misapprehend. If the King wills it I might go there well." Answers the King: "Be silent both on bench; Your feet nor his, I say, shall that way wend. Nay, by this beard, that you have seen grow blench, The dozen peers by that would stand condemned. Franks hold their peace; you'd seen them all silent. 

XIX 

Turpins of Reins is risen from his rank, Says to the King: "In peace now leave your Franks. For seven years you've lingered in this land They have endured much pain and sufferance. Give, Sire, to me the clove, also the wand, I will seek out the Spanish Sarazand, For I believe his thoughts I understand." That Emperour answers intolerant: "Go, sit you down on yonder silken mat; And speak no more, until that I command." AOI. 

XX 

"Franks, chevaliers," says the Emperour then, Charles, "Choose ye me out a baron from my marches, To Marsilie shall carry back my answer." Then says Rollanz: "There's Guenes, my goodfather." Answer the Franks: "For he can wisely manage; So let him go, there's none you should send rather." And that count Guenes is very full of anguish; Off from his neck he flings the pelts of marten, And on his feet stands clear in silken garment. Proud face he had, his eyes with colour, sparkled; Fine limbs he had, his ribs were broadly arched So fair he seemed that all the court regarded. Says to Rollant: "Fool, wherefore art so wrathful? All men know well that I am thy goodfather; Thou hast decreed, to Marsiliun I travel. Then if God grant that I return hereafter, I'll follow thee with such a force of passion That will endure so long as life may last thee." Answers Rollanz: "Thou'rt full of pride and madness. All men know well, I take no thought for slander; But some wise man, surely, should bear the answer; If the King will, I'm ready to go rather." AOI. 

XXI 

Answers him Guene: "Thou shalt not go for me. Thou'rt not my man, nor am I lord of thee. Charles commnds that I do his decree, To Sarraguce going to Marsilie; There I will work a little trickery, This mighty wrath of mine I'll thus let free." When Rollanz heard, began to laugh for glee. AOI. 

XXII 

When Guenes sees that Rollant laughs at it, Such grief he has, for rage he's like to split, A little more, and he has lost his wit: Says to that count: "I love you not a bit; A false judgement you bore me when you chid. Right Emperour, you see me where you sit, I will your word accomplish, as you bid. AOI. 

XXIII 

"To Sarraguce I must repair, 'tis plain; Whence who goes there returns no more again. Your sister's hand in marriage have I ta'en; And I've a son, there is no prettier swain: Baldwin, men say he shews the knightly strain. To him I leave my honours and domain. Care well for him; he'll look for me in vain." Answers him Charles: "Your heart is too humane. When I command, time is to start amain." AOI. 

XXIV 

Then says the King: "Guenes, before me stand; And take from me the glove, also the wand. For you have heard, you're chosen by the Franks," "Sire," answers Guenes, "all this is from Rollanz; I'll not love him, so long as I'm a man, Nor Oliver, who goes at his right hand; The dozen peers, for they are of his band, All I defy, as in your sight I stand." Then says the King: "Over intolerant. Now certainly you go when I command." "And go I can; yet have I no warrant Basile had none nor his brother Basant." 

XXV 

His right hand glove that Emperour holds out; But the count Guenes elsewhere would fain be found; When he should take, it falls upon the ground. Murmur the Franks: "God!  What may that mean now? By this message great loss shall come about." "Lordings," says Guene, "You'll soon have news enow." 

XXVI 

"Now," Guenes said, "give me your orders, Sire; Since I must go, why need I linger, I?" Then said the King "In Jesu's Name and mine!" With his right hand he has absolved and signed, Then to his care the wand and brief confides. 

XXVII 

Guenes the count goes to his hostelry, Finds for the road his garments and his gear, All of the best he takes that may appear: Spurs of fine gold he fastens on his feet, And to his side Murgles his sword of steel. On Tachebrun, his charger, next he leaps, His uncle holds the stirrup, Guinemere. Then you had seen so many knights to weep, Who all exclaim: "Unlucky lord, indeed! In the King's court these many years you've been, Noble vassal, they say that have you seen. He that for you this journey has decreed King Charlemagne will never hold him dear. The Count Rollant, he should not so have deemed, Knowing you were born of very noble breed." After they say: "Us too, Sire, shall he lead." Then answers Guenes: "Not so, the Lord be pleased! Far better one than many knights should bleed. To France the Douce, my lords, you soon shall speed, On my behalf my gentle wife you'll greet, And Pinabel, who is my friend and peer, And Baldewin, my son, whom you have seen; His rights accord and help him in his need." 

--Rides down the road, and on his way goes he.AOI.
