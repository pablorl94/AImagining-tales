<ACTION>Enter Talbot, Bedford, Burgundy, a Captain and Others.</ACTION> 

BEDFORD The day begins to break and night is fled, Whose pitchy mantle over-veiled the Earth. Here sound retreat and cease our hot pursuit. <ACTION>Retreat sounded.</ACTION> 

TALBOT Bring forth the body of old Salisbury, And here advance it in the marketplace,	 The middle center of this cursèd town. 

<ACTION>Soldiers enter bearing the body of Salisbury,Drums beating a dead march.</ACTION> 

Now have I paid my vow unto his soul: For every drop of blood was drawn from him There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight. And, that hereafter ages may behold	 What ruin happened in revenge of him, Within their chiefest temple I’ll erect A tomb wherein his corpse shall be interred, Upon the which, that everyone may read, Shall be engraved the sack of Orleance,	 The treacherous manner of his mournful death, And what a terror he had been to France. 

<ACTION>Funeral exits.</ACTION> 

But, lords, in all our bloody massacre, I muse we met not with the Dauphin’s grace, His new-come champion, virtuous Joan of Arc,	 Nor any of his false confederates. 

BEDFORD ’Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began, Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds, They did amongst the troops of armèd men Leap o’er the walls for refuge in the field.	 

BURGUNDY Myself, as far as I could well discern For smoke and dusky vapors of the night, Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull, When arm-in-arm they both came swiftly running, Like to a pair of loving turtledoves	 That could not live asunder day or night. After that things are set in order here, We’ll follow them with all the power we have. 

<ACTION>Enter a Messenger.</ACTION> 

MESSENGER All hail, my lords. Which of this princely train Call you the warlike Talbot, for his acts	 So much applauded through the realm of France? 

TALBOT Here is the Talbot. Who would speak with him? 

MESSENGER The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne, With modesty admiring thy renown, By me entreats, great lord, thou wouldst vouchsafe	 To visit her poor castle where she lies, That she may boast she hath beheld the man Whose glory fills the world with loud report. 

BURGUNDY Is it even so? Nay, then, I see our wars Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport,	 When ladies crave to be encountered with. You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit. 

TALBOT Ne’er trust me, then; for when a world of men Could not prevail with all their oratory, Yet hath a woman’s kindness overruled.—	 And therefore tell her I return great thanks, And in submission will attend on her.— Will not your Honors bear me company? 

BEDFORD No, truly, ’tis more than manners will; And I have heard it said unbidden guests	 Are often welcomest when they are gone. 

TALBOT Well then, alone, since there’s no remedy, I mean to prove this lady’s courtesy.— Come hither, captain.	 <ACTION>Whispers.</ACTION> You perceive my mind?	 

CAPTAIN I do, my lord, and mean accordingly. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
