<ACTION>Thunder. Enter the three Witches, meeting Hecate.</ACTION> 

FIRST WITCH Why, how now, Hecate? You look angerly. 

HECATE Have I not reason, beldams as you are? Saucy and overbold, how did you dare To trade and traffic with Macbeth In riddles and affairs of death,	 And I, the mistress of your charms, The close contriver of all harms, Was never called to bear my part Or show the glory of our art? And which is worse, all you have done	 Hath been but for a wayward son, Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do, Loves for his own ends, not for you. But make amends now. Get you gone, And at the pit of Acheron	 Meet me i’ th’ morning. Thither he Will come to know his destiny. Your vessels and your spells provide, Your charms and everything beside. I am for th’ air. This night I’ll spend	 Unto a dismal and a fatal end. Great business must be wrought ere noon. Upon the corner of the moon There hangs a vap’rous drop profound. I’ll catch it ere it come to ground,	 And that, distilled by magic sleights, Shall raise such artificial sprites As by the strength of their illusion Shall draw him on to his confusion. He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear	 His hopes ’bove wisdom, grace, and fear. 

And you all know, security Is mortals’ chiefest enemy.<ACTION>Music and a song.</ACTION> Hark! I am called. My little spirit, see, Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me. <ACTION>Hecate exits. </ACTION> <ACTION>Sing within “Come away, come away,” etc.</ACTION> 

FIRST WITCH Come, let’s make haste. She’ll soon be back again. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
