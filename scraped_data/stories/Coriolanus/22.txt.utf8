<ACTION>Enter Aufidius with his Lieutenant.</ACTION> 

AUFIDIUS Do they still fly to th’ Roman? 

LIEUTENANT I do not know what witchcraft’s in him, but Your soldiers use him as the grace ’fore meat, Their talk at table, and their thanks at end; And you are dark’ned in this action, sir,	 Even by your own. 

AUFIDIUS I cannot help it now, Unless by using means I lame the foot Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier, Even to my person, than I thought he would	 When first I did embrace him. Yet his nature In that’s no changeling, and I must excuse What cannot be amended. 

LIEUTENANT Yet I wish, sir— I mean for your particular—you had not	 Joined in commission with him, but either Have borne the action of yourself or else To him had left it solely. 

AUFIDIUS I understand thee well, and be thou sure, When he shall come to his account, he knows not	 What I can urge against him, although it seems, And so he thinks and is no less apparent To th’ vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly, And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state, Fights dragonlike, and does achieve as soon	 As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone That which shall break his neck or hazard mine Whene’er we come to our account. 

LIEUTENANT Sir, I beseech you, think you he’ll carry Rome? 

AUFIDIUS All places yields to him ere he sits down,	 And the nobility of Rome are his; The Senators and Patricians love him too. The Tribunes are no soldiers, and their people Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty To expel him thence. I think he’ll be to Rome	 As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it By sovereignty of nature. First, he was A noble servant to them, but he could not Carry his honors even. Whether ’twas pride, Which out of daily fortune ever taints	 The happy man; whether defect of judgment, To fail in the disposing of those chances Which he was lord of; or whether nature, Not to be other than one thing, not moving From th’ casque to th’ cushion, but commanding	 peace Even with the same austerity and garb As he controlled the war; but one of these— As he hath spices of them all—not all, For I dare so far free him—made him feared,	 So hated, and so banished. But he has a merit To choke it in the utt’rance. So our virtues Lie in th’ interpretation of the time, And power, unto itself most commendable, Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair	 T’ extol what it hath done. 

One fire drives out one fire, one nail one nail; Rights by rights falter; strengths by strengths do fail.Come, let’s away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,	 Thou art poor’st of all; then shortly art thou mine. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
