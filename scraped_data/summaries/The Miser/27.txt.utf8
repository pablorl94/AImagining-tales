Harpagon apologizes to Mariane for forgetting to ask the servants to bring her refreshments before she goes off to the fair with Élise. Of course he hasn't forgotten—he just doesn't want to offer anything that costs money.

Cléante, however, tells his father that he has already ordered some wonderful oranges and expensive preserves to give to Mariane. Harpagon loses his mind and curses Cléante to Valère.

Next, Cléante offers Mariane the valuable diamond ring on his father's finger. She refuses, but he presses it on her, further infuriating his dad.
