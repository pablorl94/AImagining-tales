<ACTION>Enter Leonato, and Dogberry, the Constable, andVerges, the Headborough.</ACTION> 

LEONATO What would you with me, honest neighbor? 

DOGBERRY Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you that decerns you nearly. 

LEONATO Brief, I pray you, for you see it is a busy time with me.	 

DOGBERRY Marry, this it is, sir. 

VERGES Yes, in truth, it is, sir. 

LEONATO What is it, my good friends? 

DOGBERRY Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter. An old man, sir, and his wits are not so blunt	 as, God help, I would desire they were, but, in faith, honest as the skin between his brows. 

VERGES Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living that is an old man and no honester than I. 

DOGBERRY Comparisons are odorous. Palabras, neighbor	 Verges. 

LEONATO Neighbors, you are tedious. 

DOGBERRY It pleases your Worship to say so, but we are the poor duke’s officers. But truly, for mine own part, if I were as tedious as a king, I could find	 in my heart to bestow it all of your Worship. 

LEONATO All thy tediousness on me, ah? 

DOGBERRY Yea, an ’twere a thousand pound more than ’tis, for I hear as good exclamation on your Worship as of any man in the city, and though I be	 but a poor man, I am glad to hear it. 

VERGES And so am I. 

LEONATO I would fain know what you have to say. 

VERGES Marry, sir, our watch tonight, excepting your Worship’s presence, ha’ ta’en a couple of as arrant	 knaves as any in Messina. 

DOGBERRY  A good old man, sir. He will be talking. As they say, “When the age is in, the wit is out.” God help us, it is a world to see!—Well said, i’ faith, neighbor Verges.—Well, God’s a good man. An two	 men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest soul, i’ faith, sir, by my troth he is, as ever broke bread, but God is to be worshiped, all men are not alike, alas, good neighbor. 

LEONATO Indeed, neighbor, he comes too short of you.	 

DOGBERRY  Gifts that God gives. 

LEONATO I must leave you. 

DOGBERRY One word, sir. Our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would have them this morning examined before	 your Worship. 

LEONATO Take their examination yourself and bring it me. I am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you. 

DOGBERRY  It shall be suffigance.	 

LEONATO  Drink some wine ere you go. Fare you well. 

<ACTION>Enter a Messenger.</ACTION> 

MESSENGER My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband. 

LEONATO I’ll wait upon them. I am ready. 

<ACTION>He exits, with the Messenger.</ACTION> 

DOGBERRY  Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis	 Seacoal. Bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the jail. We are now to examination these men. 

VERGES And we must do it wisely. 

DOGBERRY We will spare for no wit, I warrant you. Here’s that shall drive some of them to a noncome.	 Only get the learned writer to set down our excommunication and meet me at the jail. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
