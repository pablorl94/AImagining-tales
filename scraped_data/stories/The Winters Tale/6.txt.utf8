<ACTION>Enter Leontes, Lords, and Officers.</ACTION> 

LEONTES This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce, Even pushes ’gainst our heart: the party tried The daughter of a king, our wife, and one Of us too much beloved. Let us be cleared Of being tyrannous, since we so openly	 Proceed in justice, which shall have due course Even to the guilt or the purgation. Produce the prisoner. 

OFFICER It is his Highness’ pleasure that the Queen Appear in person here in court.	 

<ACTION>Enter Hermione, as to her trial, Paulina, and Ladies.</ACTION> 

Silence! 

LEONTES Read the indictment. 

OFFICER <ACTION> reads</ACTION> Hermione, queen to the worthy Leontes, King of Sicilia, thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery with Polixenes,	 King of Bohemia, and conspiring with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign lord the King, thy royal husband; the pretense whereof being by circumstances partly laid open, thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance of a true subject, didst counsel	 and aid them, for their better safety, to fly away by night. 

HERMIONE Since what I am to say must be but that Which contradicts my accusation, and The testimony on my part no other	 But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me To say “Not guilty.” Mine integrity, Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it, Be so received. But thus: if powers divine Behold our human actions, as they do, I doubt not then but innocence shall make False accusation blush and tyranny Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know, Whom least will seem to do so, my past life Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,	 As I am now unhappy; which is more Than history can pattern, though devised And played to take spectators. For behold me, A fellow of the royal bed, which owe A moiety of the throne, a great king’s daughter,	 The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing To prate and talk for life and honor fore Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it As I weigh grief, which I would spare. For honor, ’Tis a derivative from me to mine, And only that I stand for. 

I appeal To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes Came to your court, how I was in your grace, How merited to be so; since he came, With what encounter so uncurrent I	 Have strained t’ appear thus; if one jot beyond The bound of honor, or in act or will That way inclining, hardened be the hearts Of all that hear me, and my near’st of kin Cry fie upon my grave.

LEONTES I ne’er heard yet That any of these bolder vices wanted Less impudence to gainsay what they did Than to perform it first. 

HERMIONE That’s true enough,	 Though ’tis a saying, sir, not due to me. 

LEONTES You will not own it. 

HERMIONE More than mistress of Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,	 With whom I am accused, I do confess I loved him as in honor he required, With such a kind of love as might become A lady like me, with a love even such, So and no other, as yourself commanded,	 Which not to have done, I think, had been in me Both disobedience and ingratitude To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke, Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely	 That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy, I know not how it tastes, though it be dished For me to try how. All I know of it Is that Camillo was an honest man; And why he left your court, the gods themselves,	 Wotting no more than I, are ignorant. 

LEONTES You knew of his departure, as you know What you have underta’en to do in ’s absence. 

HERMIONE Sir, You speak a language that I understand not.	 My life stands in the level of your dreams, Which I’ll lay down. 

LEONTES   Your actions are my dreams. You had a bastard by Polixenes, And I but dreamed it. As you were past all shame— Those of your fact are so—so past all truth, Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself, No father owning it—which is indeed More criminal in thee than it—so thou	95 Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage Look for no less than death. 

HERMIONE Sir, spare your threats. The bug which you would fright me with I seek. To me can life be no commodity. The crown and comfort of my life, your favor, I do give lost, for I do feel it gone, But know not how it went. My second joy And first fruits of my body, from his presence I am barred like one infectious. My third comfort,	 Starred most unluckily, is from my breast, The innocent milk in it most innocent mouth, Haled out to murder; myself on every post Proclaimed a strumpet; with immodest hatred The childbed privilege denied, which longs	 To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried Here to this place, i’ th’ open air, before I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege, Tell me what blessings I have here alive, That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed. But yet hear this (mistake me not: no life, I prize it not a straw, but for mine honor, Which I would free), if I shall be condemned Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else But what your jealousies awake, I tell you	 ’Tis rigor, and not law. Your Honors all, I do refer me to the oracle. 

Apollo be my judge.

LORD   This your request Is altogether just. Therefore bring forth,	 And in Apollo’s name, his oracle.  

<ACTION>Officers exit.</ACTION> 

HERMIONE The Emperor of Russia was my father. O, that he were alive and here beholding His daughter’s trial, that he did but see The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes	 Of pity, not revenge. 

<ACTION>Enter Cleomenes, Dion, with Officers.</ACTION> 

OFFICER ,  <ACTION>presenting a sword</ACTION> You here shall swear upon this sword of justice That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought	 This sealed-up oracle, by the hand delivered Of great Apollo’s priest, and that since then You have not dared to break the holy seal Nor read the secrets in ’t. 

CLEOMENES, DION   All this we swear.	 

LEONTES Break up the seals and read. 

OFFICER <ACTION>reads</ACTION> Hermione is chaste, Polixenes blameless, Camillo a true subject, Leontes a jealous tyrant, his innocent babe truly begotten; and the King shall live without an heir if that which is lost be not	 found. 

LORDS Now blessèd be the great Apollo! 

HERMIONE Praised! 

LEONTES Hast thou read truth? 

OFFICER Ay, my lord, even so as it is here set down.	 

LEONTES There is no truth at all i’ th’ oracle. The sessions shall proceed. This is mere falsehood. 

<ACTION>Enter a Servant.</ACTION> 

SERVANT My lord the King, the King! 

LEONTES What is the business? 

SERVANT O sir, I shall be hated to report it.	 The Prince your son, with mere conceit and fear Of the Queen’s speed, is gone. 

LEONTES How? Gone? 

SERVANT  Is dead. 

LEONTES Apollo’s angry, and the heavens themselves	 Do strike at my injustice. 

<ACTION>Hermione falls.</ACTION> 

How now there? 

PAULINA This news is mortal to the Queen. Look down And see what death is doing. 

LEONTES Take her hence.	 Her heart is but o’ercharged. She will recover. I have too much believed mine own suspicion. Beseech you, tenderly apply to her Some remedies for life. 

<ACTION>Paulina exits with Officers carrying Hermione.</ACTION> 

Apollo, pardon	 My great profaneness ’gainst thine oracle. I’ll reconcile me to Polixenes, New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo, Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy; For, being transported by my jealousies	 To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose Camillo for the minister to poison My friend Polixenes, which had been done But that the good mind of Camillo tardied My swift command, though I with death and with	 Reward did threaten and encourage him, Not doing it and being done. He, most humane And filled with honor, to my kingly guest Unclasped my practice, quit his fortunes here, Which you knew great, and to the hazard	 Of all incertainties himself commended, No richer than his honor. How he glisters Through my rust, and how his piety Does my deeds make the blacker! 

<ACTION>Enter Paulina.</ACTION> 

PAULINA   Woe the while!	 O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it, Break too! 

LORD What fit is this, good lady? 

PAULINA ,  <ACTION>to Leontes</ACTION> What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me? What wheels, racks, fires? What flaying? Boiling	 In leads or oils? What old or newer torture Must I receive, whose every word deserves To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny, Together working with thy jealousies, Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle	 For girls of nine, O, think what they have done, And then run mad indeed, stark mad, for all Thy bygone fooleries were but spices of it. That thou betrayedst Polixenes, ’twas nothing; That did but show thee of a fool, inconstant	 And damnable ingrateful. Nor was ’t much Thou wouldst have poisoned good Camillo’s honor, To have him kill a king: poor trespasses, More monstrous standing by, whereof I reckon The casting forth to crows thy baby daughter	 To be or none or little, though a devil Would have shed water out of fire ere done ’t. Nor is ’t directly laid to thee the death Of the young prince, whose honorable thoughts, Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart	 That could conceive a gross and foolish sire Blemished his gracious dam. This is not, no, Laid to thy answer. 

But the last—O lords, When I have said, cry woe!—the Queen, the Queen, The sweet’st, dear’st creature’s dead, and vengeance	 for ’t Not dropped down yet.

LORD The higher powers forbid! 

PAULINA I say she’s dead. I’ll swear ’t. If word nor oath Prevail not, go and see. If you can bring	 Tincture or luster in her lip, her eye, Heat outwardly or breath within, I’ll serve you As I would do the gods.—But, O thou tyrant, Do not repent these things, for they are heavier Than all thy woes can stir. Therefore betake thee	 To nothing but despair. A thousand knees Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting, Upon a barren mountain, and still winter In storm perpetual, could not move the gods To look that way thou wert.	 

LEONTES Go on, go on. Thou canst not speak too much. I have deserved All tongues to talk their bitt’rest. 

LORD ,  <ACTION>to Paulina</ACTION> Say no more. Howe’er the business goes, you have made fault	 I’ th’ boldness of your speech. 

PAULINA I am sorry for ’t. All faults I make, when I shall come to know them, I do repent. Alas, I have showed too much The rashness of a woman. He is touched	 To th’ noble heart.—What’s gone and what’s past help Should be past grief. Do not receive affliction At my petition. I beseech you, rather Let me be punished, that have minded you	 Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege, Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman. The love I bore your queen—lo, fool again!— I’ll speak of her no more, nor of your children. I’ll not remember you of my own lord,	 Who is lost too. Take your patience to you, And I’ll say nothing. 

LEONTES Thou didst speak but well When most the truth, which I receive much better Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me	 To the dead bodies of my queen and son. One grave shall be for both. Upon them shall The causes of their death appear, unto Our shame perpetual. Once a day I’ll visit The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there	 Shall be my recreation. So long as nature Will bear up with this exercise, so long I daily vow to use it. Come, and lead me To these sorrows.
