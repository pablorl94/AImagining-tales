<ACTION>Enter Hotspur, Worcester, Lord Mortimer, and OwenGlendower.</ACTION> 

MORTIMER These promises are fair, the parties sure, And our induction full of prosperous hope. 

HOTSPUR Lord Mortimer and cousin Glendower, Will you sit down? And uncle Worcester— A plague upon it, I have forgot the map.	 

GLENDOWER No, here it is. Sit, cousin Percy, Sit, good cousin Hotspur, for by that name As oft as Lancaster doth speak of you His cheek looks pale, and with a rising sigh He wisheth you in heaven.	 

HOTSPUR   And you in hell, As oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of. 

GLENDOWER I cannot blame him. At my nativity The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes, Of burning cressets, and at my birth	 The frame and huge foundation of the Earth Shaked like a coward. 

HOTSPUR Why, so it would have done At the same season if your mother’s cat Had but kittened, though yourself had never been	 born. 

GLENDOWER I say the Earth did shake when I was born. 

HOTSPUR And I say the Earth was not of my mind, If you suppose as fearing you it shook. 

GLENDOWER The heavens were all on fire; the Earth did tremble.	 

HOTSPUR O, then the Earth shook to see the heavens on fire, And not in fear of your nativity. Diseasèd nature oftentimes breaks forth In strange eruptions; oft the teeming Earth Is with a kind of colic pinched and vexed	 By the imprisoning of unruly wind Within her womb, which, for enlargement striving, Shakes the old beldam Earth and topples down Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth Our grandam Earth, having this distemp’rature,	 In passion shook. 

GLENDOWER  Cousin, of many men I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave To tell you once again that at my birth The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,	 The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields. These signs have marked me extraordinary, And all the courses of my life do show I am not in the roll of common men.	 Where is he living, clipped in with the sea That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales, Which calls me pupil or hath read to me? And bring him out that is but woman’s son Can trace me in the tedious ways of art	 And hold me pace in deep experiments. 

HOTSPUR I think there’s no man speaks better Welsh. I’ll to dinner. 

MORTIMER Peace, cousin Percy. You will make him mad. 

GLENDOWER I can call spirits from the vasty deep.	 

HOTSPUR Why, so can I, or so can any man, But will they come when you do call for them? 

GLENDOWER Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command the devil. 

HOTSPUR And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil	 By telling truth. Tell truth and shame the devil. If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither, And I’ll be sworn I have power to shame him hence. O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!	 

MORTIMER Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat. 

GLENDOWER Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye And sandy-bottomed Severn have I sent him Bootless home and weather-beaten back.	 

HOTSPUR Home without boots, and in foul weather too! How ’scapes he agues, in the devil’s name? 

GLENDOWER Come, here is the map. Shall we divide our right According to our threefold order ta’en? 

MORTIMER The Archdeacon hath divided it	 Into three limits very equally: England, from Trent and Severn hitherto, By south and east is to my part assigned; All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore, And all the fertile land within that bound	 To Owen Glendower; and, dear coz, to you The remnant northward lying off from Trent. And our indentures tripartite are drawn, Which being sealèd interchangeably— A business that this night may execute—	 Tomorrow, cousin Percy, you and I And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth To meet your father and the Scottish power, As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury. My father Glendower is not ready yet, Nor shall we need his help these fourteen days. To Glendower. Within that space you may have drawn together Your tenants, friends, and neighboring gentlemen. 

GLENDOWER A shorter time shall send me to you, lords, And in my conduct shall your ladies come, From whom you now must steal and take no leave, For there will be a world of water shed Upon the parting of your wives and you. 

HOTSPUR ,  <ACTION>looking at the map</ACTION> Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,	 In quantity equals not one of yours. See how this river comes me cranking in And cuts me from the best of all my land A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out. I’ll have the current in this place dammed up,	 And here the smug and silver Trent shall run In a new channel, fair and evenly. It shall not wind with such a deep indent To rob me of so rich a bottom here. 

GLENDOWER Not wind? It shall, it must. You see it doth.	 

MORTIMER , <ACTION> to Hotspur</ACTION> Yea, but mark how he bears his course, and runs me up With like advantage on the other side, Gelding the opposèd continent as much As on the other side it takes from you.	 

WORCESTER Yea, but a little charge will trench him here And on this north side win this cape of land, And then he runs straight and even. 

HOTSPUR I’ll have it so. A little charge will do it. 

GLENDOWER I’ll not have it altered.	 

HOTSPUR Will not you? 

GLENDOWER   No, nor you shall not. 

HOTSPUR  Who shall say me nay? 

GLENDOWER Why, that will I. 

HOTSPUR Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.	 

GLENDOWER I can speak English, lord, as well as you, For I was trained up in the English court, Where being but young I framèd to the harp Many an English ditty lovely well And gave the tongue a helpful ornament—	 A virtue that was never seen in you. 

HOTSPUR Marry, and I am glad of it with all my heart. I had rather be a kitten and cry “mew” Than one of these same meter balladmongers. I had rather hear a brazen can’stick turned,	 Or a dry wheel grate on the axletree, And that would set my teeth nothing an edge, Nothing so much as mincing poetry. ’Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag. 

GLENDOWER Come, you shall have Trent turned.	 

HOTSPUR I do not care. I’ll give thrice so much land To any well-deserving friend; But in the way of bargain, mark you me, I’ll cavil on the ninth part of a hair. Are the indentures drawn? Shall we be gone? 

GLENDOWER The moon shines fair. You may away by night. I’ll haste the writer, and withal Break with your wives of your departure hence. I am afraid my daughter will run mad, So much she doteth on her Mortimer.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

MORTIMER Fie, cousin Percy, how you cross my father! 

HOTSPUR I cannot choose. Sometime he angers me With telling me of the moldwarp and the ant, Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies, And of a dragon and a finless fish,	 A clip-winged griffin and a moulten raven, A couching lion and a ramping cat, And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff As puts me from my faith. I tell you what— He held me last night at least nine hours	 In reckoning up the several devils’ names That were his lackeys. I cried “Hum,” and “Well, go to,” But marked him not a word. O, he is as tedious As a tired horse, a railing wife,	 Worse than a smoky house. I had rather live With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far, Than feed on cates and have him talk to me In any summer house in Christendom. 

MORTIMER In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,	 Exceedingly well read and profited In strange concealments, valiant as a lion, And wondrous affable, and as bountiful As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin? He holds your temper in a high respect	 And curbs himself even of his natural scope When you come cross his humor. Faith, he does. I warrant you that man is not alive Might so have tempted him as you have done Without the taste of danger and reproof. But do not use it oft, let me entreat you. 

WORCESTER , <ACTION> to Hotspur</ACTION> In faith, my lord, you are too willful-blame, And, since your coming hither, have done enough To put him quite besides his patience. You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault.	 Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood— And that’s the dearest grace it renders you— Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage, Defect of manners, want of government,	 Pride, haughtiness, opinion, and disdain, The least of which, haunting a nobleman, Loseth men’s hearts and leaves behind a stain Upon the beauty of all parts besides, Beguiling them of commendation.	 

HOTSPUR Well, I am schooled. Good manners be your speed! Here come our wives, and let us take our leave. 

<ACTION>Enter Glendower with the Ladies.</ACTION> 

MORTIMER This is the deadly spite that angers me: My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh. 

GLENDOWER My daughter weeps; she’ll not part with you.	 She’ll be a soldier too, she’ll to the wars. 

MORTIMER Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy Shall follow in your conduct speedily. 

<ACTION>Glendower speaks to her in Welsh,and she answers him in the same.</ACTION> 

GLENDOWER She is desperate here, a peevish self-willed harlotry, One that no persuasion can do good upon.	 <ACTION>The Lady speaks in Welsh.</ACTION> 

HOTSPUR Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down. Come, quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy	 lap. 

LADY PERCY  Go, you giddy goose. The music plays. 

HOTSPUR Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh, And ’tis no marvel he is so humorous. By ’r Lady, he is a good musician.	 

LADY PERCY Then should you be nothing but musical, for you are altogether governed by humors. Lie still, you thief, and hear the lady sing in Welsh. 

HOTSPUR I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.	 

LADY PERCY Wouldst thou have thy head broken? 

HOTSPUR  No. 

LADY PERCY  Then be still. 

HOTSPUR  Neither; ’tis a woman’s fault. 

LADY PERCY Now God help thee!	 

HOTSPUR  To the Welsh lady’s bed. 

LADY PERCY  What’s that? 

HOTSPUR Peace, she sings. 

<ACTION>Here the Lady sings a Welsh song.</ACTION> 

HOTSPUR Come, Kate, I’ll have your song too. 

LADY PERCY   Not mine, in good sooth.	 

HOTSPUR Not yours, in good sooth! Heart, you swear like a comfit-maker’s wife! “Not you, in good sooth,” and “as true as I live,” and “as God shall mend me,” and “as sure as day”— And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths	 As if thou never walk’st further than Finsbury. Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art, A good mouth-filling oath, and leave “in sooth,” And such protest of pepper-gingerbread To velvet-guards and Sunday citizens.	 Come, sing. 

LADY PERCY  I will not sing. 

HOTSPUR  ’Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be redbreast teacher. An the indentures be drawn, I’ll away within these two hours, and so come in when	 you will.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

GLENDOWER Come, come, Lord Mortimer, you are as slow As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go. By this our book is drawn. We’ll but seal, And then to horse immediately.	 

MORTIMER With all my heart. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
