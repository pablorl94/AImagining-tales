Chapter 4.XXVI. 

It is with Love as with Cuckoldom-- 

But now I am talking of beginning a book, and have long had a thing upon my mind to be imparted to the reader, which, if not imparted now, can never be imparted to him as long as I live (whereas the Comparison may be imparted to him any hour in the day)--I'll just mention it, and begin in good earnest. 

The thing is this. 

That of all the several ways of beginning a book which are now in practice throughout the known world, I am confident my own way of doing it is the best--I'm sure it is the most religious--for I begin with writing the first sentence--and trusting to Almighty God for the second. 

'Twould cure an author for ever of the fuss and folly of opening his street-door, and calling in his neighbours and friends, and kinsfolk, with the devil and all his imps, with their hammers and engines, &c. only to observe how one sentence of mine follows another, and how the plan follows the whole. 

I wish you saw me half starting out of my chair, with what confidence, as I grasp the elbow of it, I look up--catching the idea, even sometimes before it half way reaches me-- 

I believe in my conscience I intercept many a thought which heaven intended for another man. 

Pope and his Portrait (Vid. Pope's Portrait.) are fools to me--no martyr is ever so full of faith or fire--I wish I could say of good works too--but I have no 

Zeal or Anger--or Anger or Zeal-- 

And till gods and men agree together to call it by the same name--the errantest Tartuffe, in science--in politics--or in religion, shall never kindle a spark within me, or have a worse word, or a more unkind greeting, than what he will read in the next chapter.
