<ACTION>Flourish. Enter King Henry, Warwick, Montague,Clarence, Oxford, and Exeter, all wearing the red rose.</ACTION> 

WARWICK What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia, With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders, Hath passed in safety through the Narrow Seas, And with his troops doth march amain to London, And many giddy people flock to him.	 

KING HENRY Let’s levy men and beat him back again. 

CLARENCE A little fire is quickly trodden out, Which, being suffered, rivers cannot quench. 

WARWICK In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends, Not mutinous in peace yet bold in war.	 Those will I muster up; and thou, son Clarence, Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent The knights and gentlemen to come with thee.— Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham, Northampton, and in Leicestershire shalt find	 Men well inclined to hear what thou command’st.— And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well beloved, In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends.— My sovereign, with the loving citizens, Like to his island girt in with the ocean,	 Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs, Shall rest in London till we come to him. Fair lords, take leave, and stand not to reply.— Farewell, my sovereign. 

KING HENRY Farewell, my Hector and my Troy’s true hope. 

CLARENCE In sign of truth, I kiss your Highness’ hand. 

KING HENRY Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate. 

MONTAGUE Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave. 

OXFORD And thus I seal my truth, and bid adieu. <ACTION>He kisses Henry’s hand.</ACTION> 

KING HENRY Sweet Oxford and my loving Montague	 And all at once, once more a happy farewell. 

WARWICK Farewell, sweet lords. Let’s meet at Coventry. 

<ACTION>All but King Henry and Exeter exit.</ACTION> 

KING HENRY Here at the palace will I rest awhile. Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your Lordship? Methinks the power that Edward hath in field	 Should not be able to encounter mine. 

EXETER The doubt is that he will seduce the rest. 

KING HENRY That’s not my fear. My meed hath got me fame. I have not stopped mine ears to their demands, Nor posted off their suits with slow delays.	 My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds, My mildness hath allayed their swelling griefs, My mercy dried their water-flowing tears. I have not been desirous of their wealth Nor much oppressed them with great subsidies,	 Nor forward of revenge, though they much erred. Then why should they love Edward more than me? No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace; And when the lion fawns upon the lamb, The lamb will never cease to follow him. 

<ACTION>Shout within “À York! À York!”</ACTION> 

EXETER Hark, hark, my lord, what shouts are these? 

<ACTION>Enter King Edward and Richard and Soldiers,all wearing the white rose.</ACTION> 

KING EDWARD Seize on the shamefaced Henry, bear him hence, And once again proclaim us King of England.— You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow. Now stops thy spring; my sea shall suck them dry	 And swell so much the higher by their ebb.— Hence with him to the Tower. Let him not speak. 

<ACTION>Soldiers exit with King Henry and Exeter.</ACTION> 

And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course, Where peremptory Warwick now remains. The sun shines hot, and if we use delay,	 Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay. 

RICHARD Away betimes, before his forces join, And take the great-grown traitor unawares. Brave warriors, march amain towards Coventry. 

<ACTION>They exit</ACTION>
