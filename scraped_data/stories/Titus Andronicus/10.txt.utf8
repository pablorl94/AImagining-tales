<ACTION>Enter Emperor Saturninus and Empress Tamoraand her two sons Chiron and Demetrius, withAttendants. The Emperor brings the arrows in hishand that Titus shot at him.</ACTION> 

SATURNINUS Why, lords, what wrongs are these! Was ever seen An emperor in Rome thus overborne, Troubled, confronted thus, and for the extent Of equal justice, used in such contempt? My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,	 However these disturbers of our peace Buzz in the people’s ears, there naught hath passed But even with law against the willful sons Of old Andronicus. And what an if His sorrows have so overwhelmed his wits? Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks, His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness? And now he writes to heaven for his redress! See, here’s “to Jove,” and this “to Mercury,” This “to Apollo,” this to the god of war. Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome! What’s this but libeling against the Senate And blazoning our unjustice everywhere? A goodly humor is it not, my lords? As who would say, in Rome no justice were. 

But if I live, his feignèd ecstasies Shall be no shelter to these outrages, But he and his shall know that justice lives In Saturninus’ health, whom, if he sleep, He’ll so awake as he in fury shall	 Cut off the proud’st conspirator that lives.

TAMORA My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine, Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts, Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus’ age, Th’ effects of sorrow for his valiant sons,	 Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarred his heart, And rather comfort his distressèd plight Than prosecute the meanest or the best For these contempts. ( <ACTION>Aside.</ACTION> ) Why, thus it shall	 become High-witted Tamora to gloze with all. But, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick. Thy lifeblood out, if Aaron now be wise, Then is all safe, the anchor in the port.	 

<ACTION>Enter Country Fellow.</ACTION> 

TAMORA How now, good fellow, wouldst thou speak with us? 

COUNTRY FELLOW Yea, forsooth, an your Mistresship be emperial. 

TAMORA Empress I am, but yonder sits the Emperor. 

COUNTRY FELLOW ’Tis he!—God and Saint Stephen	 give you good e’en. I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here. 

<ACTION>Saturninus reads the letter.</ACTION> 

SATURNINUS Go, take him away, and hang him presently. 

COUNTRY FELLOW  How much money must I have? 

TAMORA Come, sirrah, you must be hanged.	 

COUNTRY FELLOW  Hanged! By ’r Lady, then I have brought up a neck to a fair end. 

<ACTION>He exits with Attendants.</ACTION> 

SATURNINUS Despiteful and intolerable wrongs! Shall I endure this monstrous villainy? I know from whence this same device proceeds.	 May this be borne?—as if his traitorous sons, That died by law for murder of our brother, Have by my means been butchered wrongfully! Go, drag the villain hither by the hair. Nor age nor honor shall shape privilege.	 For this proud mock, I’ll be thy slaughterman, Sly, frantic wretch, that holp’st to make me great In hope thyself should govern Rome and me. 

<ACTION>Enter nuntius, Aemilius.</ACTION> 

SATURNINUS What news with thee, Aemilius? 

AEMILIUS Arm, my lords! Rome never had more cause.	 The Goths have gathered head, and with a power Of high-resolvèd men bent to the spoil, They hither march amain under conduct Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus, Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do	 As much as ever Coriolanus did. 

SATURNINUS Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths? These tidings nip me, and I hang the head As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms. Ay, now begins our sorrows to approach.	 ’Tis he the common people love so much. Myself hath often heard them say, When I have walkèd like a private man, That Lucius’ banishment was wrongfully, And they have wished that Lucius were their emperor.	 

TAMORA Why should you fear? Is not your city strong? 

SATURNINUS Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius And will revolt from me to succor him. 

TAMORA King, be thy thoughts imperious like thy name. Is the sun dimmed that gnats do fly in it?	 The eagle suffers little birds to sing And is not careful what they mean thereby, Knowing that with the shadow of his wings He can at pleasure stint their melody. Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.	 Then cheer thy spirit, for know, thou emperor, I will enchant the old Andronicus With words more sweet and yet more dangerous Than baits to fish or honey-stalks to sheep, Whenas the one is wounded with the bait,	 The other rotted with delicious feed. 

SATURNINUS But he will not entreat his son for us. 

TAMORA If Tamora entreat him, then he will, For I can smooth and fill his agèd ears With golden promises, that were his heart	 Almost impregnable, his old ears deaf, Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue. <ACTION>To Aemilius. </ACTION> Go thou before to be our ambassador. Say that the Emperor requests a parley Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting	 Even at his father’s house, the old Andronicus. 

SATURNINUS Aemilius, do this message honorably, And if he stand in hostage for his safety, Bid him demand what pledge will please him best. 

AEMILIUS Your bidding shall I do effectually.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

TAMORA Now will I to that old Andronicus And temper him with all the art I have To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths. And now, sweet emperor, be blithe again, And bury all thy fear in my devices.	 

SATURNINUS Then go successantly, and plead to him. <ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
