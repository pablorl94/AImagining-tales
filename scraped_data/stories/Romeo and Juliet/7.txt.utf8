<ACTION>Enter Romeo alone.</ACTION> 

ROMEO Can I go forward when my heart is here? Turn back, dull earth, and find thy center out. 

<ACTION>He withdraws.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Benvolio with Mercutio.</ACTION> 

BENVOLIO Romeo, my cousin Romeo, Romeo! 

MERCUTIO He is wise And, on my life, hath stol’n him home to bed.	 

BENVOLIO He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall. Call, good Mercutio. 

MERCUTIO Nay, I’ll conjure too. Romeo! Humors! Madman! Passion! Lover! Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh.	 Speak but one rhyme and I am satisfied. Cry but “Ay me,” pronounce but “love” and “dove.” Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word, One nickname for her purblind son and heir,	 Young Abraham Cupid, he that shot so trim When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid.— He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not. The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.— I conjure thee by Rosaline’s bright eyes,	 By her high forehead, and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh, And the demesnes that there adjacent lie, That in thy likeness thou appear to us. 

BENVOLIO An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.	 

MERCUTIO This cannot anger him. ’Twould anger him To raise a spirit in his mistress’ circle Of some strange nature, letting it there stand Till she had laid it and conjured it down. That were some spite. My invocation	 Is fair and honest. In his mistress’ name, I conjure only but to raise up him. 

BENVOLIO Come, he hath hid himself among these trees To be consorted with the humorous night. Blind is his love and best befits the dark.	 

MERCUTIO If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark. Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.— O Romeo, that she were, O, that she were	 An open-arse, thou a pop’rin pear. Romeo, good night. I’ll to my truckle bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.— Come, shall we go? 

BENVOLIO Go, then, for ’tis in vain	 To seek him here that means not to be found. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
