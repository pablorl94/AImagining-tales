QUEEN KATHERINE Sir, I desire you do me right and justice, And to bestow your pity on me; for I am a most poor woman and a stranger, Born out of your dominions, having here No judge indifferent nor no more assurance	 Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir, In what have I offended you? What cause Hath my behavior given to your displeasure That thus you should proceed to put me off And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness	 I have been to you a true and humble wife, At all times to your will conformable, Ever in fear to kindle your dislike, Yea, subject to your countenance, glad or sorry As I saw it inclined. When was the hour	 I ever contradicted your desire, Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends Have I not strove to love, although I knew He were mine enemy? What friend of mine That had to him derived your anger did I	 Continue in my liking? Nay, gave notice He was from thence discharged? Sir, call to mind That I have been your wife in this obedience Upward of twenty years, and have been blessed With many children by you. 

If, in the course	 And process of this time, you can report, And prove it too, against mine honor aught, My bond to wedlock or my love and duty Against your sacred person, in God’s name Turn me away and let the foul’st contempt	 Shut door upon me, and so give me up To the sharp’st kind of justice.Please you, sir, The King your father was reputed for A prince most prudent, of an excellent And unmatched wit and judgment. Ferdinand,	 My father, King of Spain, was reckoned one The wisest prince that there had reigned by many A year before. It is not to be questioned That they had gathered a wise council to them Of every realm, that did debate this business,	 Who deemed our marriage lawful. Wherefore I humbly Beseech you, sir, to spare me till I may Be by my friends in Spain advised, whose counsel I will implore. If not, i’ th’ name of God, Your pleasure be fulfilled. 

WOLSEY You have here, lady, And of your choice, these reverend fathers, men Of singular integrity and learning, Yea, the elect o’ th’ land, who are assembled To plead your cause. It shall be therefore bootless	 That longer you desire the court, as well For your own quiet as to rectify What is unsettled in the King. 

CAMPEIUS His Grace Hath spoken well and justly. Therefore, madam,	 It’s fit this royal session do proceed And that without delay their arguments Be now produced and heard. 

QUEEN KATHERINE Lord Cardinal, To you I speak.	 

WOLSEY   Your pleasure, madam. 

QUEEN KATHERINE Sir, I am about to weep; but thinking that We are a queen, or long have dreamed so, certain The daughter of a king, my drops of tears	 I’ll turn to sparks of fire. 

WOLSEY Be patient yet. 

QUEEN KATHERINE I will, when you are humble; nay, before, Or God will punish me. I do believe, Induced by potent circumstances, that	 You are mine enemy, and make my challenge You shall not be my judge; for it is you Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me— Which God’s dew quench! Therefore I say again, I utterly abhor, yea, from my soul	 Refuse you for my judge, whom, yet once more, I hold my most malicious foe and think not At all a friend to truth. 

WOLSEY I do profess You speak not like yourself, who ever yet	 Have stood to charity and displayed th’ effects Of disposition gentle and of wisdom O’ertopping woman’s power. Madam, you do me wrong. I have no spleen against you, nor injustice	 For you or any. How far I have proceeded, Or how far further shall, is warranted By a commission from the Consistory, Yea, the whole Consistory of Rome. You charge me That I “have blown this coal.” I do deny it.	 The King is present. If it be known to him That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound, And worthily, my falsehood, yea, as much As you have done my truth. If he know That I am free of your report, he knows	 I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him It lies to cure me, and the cure is to Remove these thoughts from you, the which before His Highness shall speak in, I do beseech You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking	 And to say so no more. 

QUEEN KATHERINE My lord, my lord, I am a simple woman, much too weak T’ oppose your cunning. You’re meek and humble-mouthed;	 You sign your place and calling, in full seeming, With meekness and humility, but your heart Is crammed with arrogancy, spleen, and pride. You have by fortune and his Highness’ favors Gone slightly o’er low steps, and now are mounted	 Where powers are your retainers, and your words, Domestics to you, serve your will as ’t please Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you, You tender more your person’s honor than Your high profession spiritual, that again	 I do refuse you for my judge, and here, Before you all, appeal unto the Pope To bring my whole cause ’fore his Holiness, And to be judged by him. 

<ACTION>She curtsies to the King, and offers to depart.</ACTION> 

CAMPEIUS The Queen is obstinate,	 Stubborn to justice, apt to accuse it, and Disdainful to be tried by ’t. ’Tis not well. She’s going away. 

KING  Call her again. 

CRIER Katherine, Queen of England, come into the	 court. 

GENTLEMAN USHER  Madam, you are called back. 

QUEEN KATHERINE What need you note it? Pray you, keep your way. When you are called, return. Now, the Lord help! They vex me past my patience. Pray you, pass on.	 I will not tarry; no, nor ever more Upon this business my appearance make In any of their courts. 

<ACTION>Queen and her Attendants exit.</ACTION> 

KING Go thy ways, Kate. That man i’ th’ world who shall report he has	 A better wife, let him in naught be trusted, For speaking false in that. Thou art, alone— If thy rare qualities, sweet gentleness, Thy meekness saintlike, wifelike government, Obeying in commanding, and thy parts	 Sovereign and pious else, could speak thee out— The queen of earthly queens. She’s noble born, And like her true nobility she has Carried herself towards me. 

WOLSEY Most gracious sir,	 In humblest manner I require your Highness That it shall please you to declare in hearing Of all these ears—for where I am robbed and bound, There must I be unloosed, although not there At once and fully satisfied—whether ever I	 Did broach this business to your Highness, or Laid any scruple in your way which might Induce you to the question on ’t, or ever Have to you, but with thanks to God for such A royal lady, spake one the least word that might	 Be to the prejudice of her present state, Or touch of her good person? 

KING My Lord Cardinal, I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honor, I free you from ’t. You are not to be taught	 That you have many enemies that know not Why they are so but, like to village curs, Bark when their fellows do. By some of these The Queen is put in anger. You’re excused. But will you be more justified? You ever	 Have wished the sleeping of this business, never desired It to be stirred, but oft have hindered, oft, The passages made toward it. On my honor I speak my good Lord Cardinal to this point	 And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to ’t, I will be bold with time and your attention. Then mark th’ inducement. Thus it came; give heed to ’t: My conscience first received a tenderness,	 Scruple, and prick on certain speeches uttered By th’ Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador, Who had been hither sent on the debating A marriage ’twixt the Duke of Orleans and Our daughter Mary. 

I’ th’ progress of this business,	 Ere a determinate resolution, he, I mean the Bishop, did require a respite Wherein he might the King his lord advertise Whether our daughter were legitimate, Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,	 Sometime our brother’s wife.This respite shook The bosom of my conscience, entered me, Yea, with a spitting power, and made to tremble The region of my breast; which forced such way That many mazed considerings did throng	 And pressed in with this caution. First, methought I stood not in the smile of heaven, who had Commanded nature that my lady’s womb, If it conceived a male child by me, should Do no more offices of life to ’t than	 The grave does to th’ dead, for her male issue Or died where they were made, or shortly after This world had aired them. Hence I took a thought This was a judgment on me, that my kingdom, Well worthy the best heir o’ th’ world, should not	 Be gladded in ’t by me. Then follows that I weighed the danger which my realms stood in By this my issue’s fail, and that gave to me Many a groaning throe. 

Thus hulling in The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer	 Toward this remedy whereupon we are Now present here together.That’s to say, I meant to rectify my conscience, which I then did feel full sick, and yet not well, By all the reverend fathers of the land	 And doctors learnèd. First, I began in private With you, my Lord of Lincoln. You remember How under my oppression I did reek When I first moved you. 

LINCOLN   Very well, my liege.	 

KING I have spoke long. Be pleased yourself to say How far you satisfied me. 

LINCOLN So please your Highness, The question did at first so stagger me, Bearing a state of mighty moment in ’t And consequence of dread, that I committed The daring’st counsel which I had to doubt, And did entreat your Highness to this course Which you are running here. 

KING I then moved you,	 My Lord of Canterbury, and got your leave To make this present summons. Unsolicited I left no reverend person in this court, But by particular consent proceeded Under your hands and seals. Therefore go on,	 For no dislike i’ th’ world against the person Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points Of my allegèd reasons drives this forward. Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life And kingly dignity, we are contented	 To wear our mortal state to come with her, Katherine our queen, before the primest creature That’s paragoned o’ th’ world. 

CAMPEIUS So please your Highness, The Queen being absent, ’tis a needful fitness That we adjourn this court till further day. Meanwhile must be an earnest motion Made to the Queen to call back her appeal She intends unto his Holiness. 

KING ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> I may perceive	 These cardinals trifle with me. I abhor This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome. My learnèd and well-belovèd servant Cranmer, Prithee return. With thy approach, I know, My comfort comes along.—Break up the court. I say, set on. 

<ACTION>They exit, in manner as they entered.</ACTION>
