<ACTION>Enter Cleon and Dionyza.</ACTION> 

DIONYZA Why, are you foolish? Can it be undone? 

CLEON O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter The sun and moon ne’er looked upon! 

DIONYZA  I think you’ll turn a child again. 

CLEON Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,	 I’d give it to undo the deed. A lady Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess To equal any single crown o’ th’ Earth I’ the justice of compare. O villain Leonine, Whom thou hast poisoned too!	 If thou hadst drunk to him, ’t had been a kindness Becoming well thy face. What canst thou say When noble Pericles shall demand his child? 

DIONYZA That she is dead. Nurses are not the Fates. To foster is not ever to preserve.	 She died at night; I’ll say so. Who can cross it Unless you play the impious innocent And, for an honest attribute, cry out “She died by foul play!” 

CLEON  O, go to. Well, well,	 Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods Do like this worst. 

DIONYZA  Be one of those that thinks The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence And open this to Pericles. I do shame	 To think of what a noble strain you are, And of how coward a spirit. 

CLEON To such proceeding Whoever but his approbation added, Though not his prime consent, he did not flow	 From honorable courses. 

DIONYZA Be it so, then. Yet none does know but you how she came dead, Nor none can know, Leonine being gone. She did distain my child and stood between	 Her and her fortunes. None would look on her, But cast their gazes on Marina’s face, Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through, And though you call my course unnatural,	 You not your child well loving, yet I find It greets me as an enterprise of kindness Performed to your sole daughter. 

CLEON   Heavens forgive it. 

DIONYZA And as for Pericles,	 What should he say? We wept after her hearse, And yet we mourn. Her monument is Almost finished, and her epitaphs In glitt’ring golden characters express A general praise to her, and care in us	 At whose expense ’tis done. 

CLEON   Thou art like the Harpy, Which, to betray, dost with thine angel’s face Seize with thine eagle’s talons. 

DIONYZA You’re like one that superstitiously	 Do swear to the gods that winter kills the flies. But yet I know you’ll do as I advise.
