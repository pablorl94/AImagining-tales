SCENE VI.--CLÉANTE, LA FLÈCHE. 

LA FL. (_leaving the garden with a casket_). Ah! Sir, you are just in the nick of time. Quick! follow me. 

CLE. What is the matter? 

LA FL. Follow me, I say. We are saved. 

CLE. How? 

LA FL. Here is all you want. 

CLE. What? 

LA FL. I have watched for this all day. 

CLE. What is it? 

LA FL. Your father's treasure that I have got hold of. 

CLE. How did you manage it? 

LA FL. I will tell you all about it. Let us be off. I can hear him calling out.
