At the palace in London, Queen Elizabeth chills out with the Duchess of York, the cardinal, and her young son, the Duke of York.

Everyone's excited and a little worried about little Prince Edward making it to the castle OK – who knows what could happen to him before he can be crowned King?

Prince Edward's little brother, the Duke of York, jokes around with the adults and shows that he's a pretty sharp little kid. He tells his mom and grandmother that his Uncle Richard used to bag on him and tease him about growing like a weed.

The Duchess of York points out that Richard wasn't exactly a healthy child – he grew pretty slowly when he was young.

The little Duke of York says he heard that his Uncle Richard was born with teeth and Queen Elizabeth tells him to quit being a little brat – it's not nice to gossip about adults.

A messenger arrives with bad news: Lord Rivers, Lord Gray, and Sir Thomas Vaughn have been thrown in the slammer at Pomfret Castle. (Pomfret is the castle where King Richard II died.)

Everyone knows this is bad news. Imprisonment there is usually just one step away from execution.

Guess who gave the orders for the arrests? Richard (Duke of Gloucester) and Buckingham.

Elizabeth freaks out and predicts that her entire family is going down.

The Duchess of York points out how terrible civil war is, especially when family members are willing to kill each other.

Elizabeth decides to take her youngest son, the Duke of York, and escape to sanctuary with him. She is given blessings and a seal from the Cardinal, who will lead her to safety.
