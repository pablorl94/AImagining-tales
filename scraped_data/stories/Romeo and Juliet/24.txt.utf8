FRIAR JOHN Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho! 

<ACTION>Enter Friar Lawrence.</ACTION> 

FRIAR LAWRENCE This same should be the voice of Friar John.— Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo? Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter. 

FRIAR JOHN Going to find a barefoot brother out,	 One of our order, to associate me, Here in this city visiting the sick, And finding him, the searchers of the town, Suspecting that we both were in a house Where the infectious pestilence did reign,	 Sealed up the doors and would not let us forth, So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed. 

FRIAR LAWRENCE Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo? 

FRIAR JOHN I could not send it—here it is again— <ACTION>Returning the letter.</ACTION> Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,	 So fearful were they of infection. 

FRIAR LAWRENCE Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood, The letter was not nice but full of charge, Of dear import, and the neglecting it May do much danger. Friar John, go hence.	 Get me an iron crow and bring it straight Unto my cell. 

FRIAR JOHN Brother, I’ll go and bring it thee.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

FRIAR LAWRENCE Now must I to the monument alone. Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.	 She will beshrew me much that Romeo Hath had no notice of these accidents. But I will write again to Mantua, And keep her at my cell till Romeo come. Poor living corse, closed in a dead man’s tomb!	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
