<ACTION>Enter Macbeth’s Wife, alone, with a letter.</ACTION> 

LADY MACBETH ,  <ACTION>reading the letter </ACTION> They met me in the day of success, and I have learned by the perfect’st report they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from the King, who all-hailed me “Thane of Cawdor,” by which title, before, these Weïrd Sisters saluted me and referred me to the coming on of time with “Hail, king that shalt be.” This have I thought good to deliver	 thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou might’st not lose the dues of rejoicing by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell. Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be	 What thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature; It is too full o’ th’ milk of human kindness To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great, Art not without ambition, but without The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst	 highly, That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false And yet wouldst wrongly win. 

Thou ’dst have, great Glamis, That which cries “Thus thou must do,” if thou have	 it, And that which rather thou dost fear to do, Than wishest should be undone.Hie thee hither, That I may pour my spirits in thine ear And chastise with the valor of my tongue	 All that impedes thee from the golden round, Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem To have thee crowned withal. 

<ACTION>Enter Messenger.</ACTION> 

What is your tidings? 

MESSENGER The King comes here tonight.	 

LADY MACBETH  Thou ’rt mad to say it. Is not thy master with him, who, were ’t so, Would have informed for preparation? 

MESSENGER So please you, it is true. Our thane is coming. One of my fellows had the speed of him,	 Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more Than would make up his message. 

LADY MACBETH  Give him tending. He brings great news.	 <ACTION>Messenger exits.</ACTION> The raven himself is hoarse	 That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan Under my battlements. Come, you spirits That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full Of direst cruelty. Make thick my blood.	 Stop up th’ access and passage to remorse, That no compunctious visitings of nature Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between Th’ effect and it. Come to my woman’s breasts And take my milk for gall, you murd’ring ministers,	 Wherever in your sightless substances You wait on nature’s mischief. Come, thick night, And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell, That my keen knife see not the wound it makes, Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark	 To cry “Hold, hold!” 

<ACTION>Enter Macbeth.</ACTION> 

Great Glamis, worthy Cawdor, Greater than both by the all-hail hereafter! Thy letters have transported me beyond This ignorant present, and I feel now	 The future in the instant. 

MACBETH My dearest love, Duncan comes here tonight. 

LADY MACBETH And when goes hence? 

MACBETH Tomorrow, as he purposes.	 

LADY MACBETH O, never Shall sun that morrow see! Your face, my thane, is as a book where men May read strange matters. To beguile the time, Look like the time. Bear welcome in your eye,	 Your hand, your tongue. Look like th’ innocent flower, But be the serpent under ’t. He that’s coming Must be provided for; and you shall put This night’s great business into my dispatch,	 Which shall to all our nights and days to come Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom. 

MACBETH We will speak further. 

LADY MACBETH Only look up clear. To alter favor ever is to fear.	 Leave all the rest to me. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
