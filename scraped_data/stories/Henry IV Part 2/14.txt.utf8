WARWICK ,  <ACTION>to an Attendant</ACTION> Call for the music in the other room. 

KING Set me the crown upon my pillow here. The crown is placed on the bed. 

THOMAS OF CLARENCE ,  <ACTION>aside to the others</ACTION> His eye is hollow, and he changes much.	 

WARWICK Less noise, less noise. 

<ACTION>Enter Prince Harry.</ACTION> 

PRINCE Who saw the Duke of Clarence? 

THOMAS OF CLARENCE ,  <ACTION>weeping</ACTION> I am here, brother, full of heaviness. 

PRINCE How now, rain within doors, and none abroad? How doth the King?	 

HUMPHREY OF GLOUCESTER Exceeding ill. 

PRINCE Heard he the good news yet? Tell it him. 

HUMPHREY OF GLOUCESTER He altered much upon the hearing it. 

PRINCE If he be sick with joy, he’ll recover without physic.	 

WARWICK Not so much noise, my lords.—Sweet prince, speak low. The King your father is disposed to sleep. 

THOMAS OF CLARENCE Let us withdraw into the other room. 

WARWICK Will ’t please your Grace to go along with us?	 

PRINCE No, I will sit and watch here by the King. 

<ACTION>All but Prince and King exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>All but Prince and King exit.</ACTION> 

Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow, Being so troublesome a bedfellow? O polished perturbation, golden care, That keep’st the ports of slumber open wide	 To many a watchful night! Sleep with it now; Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet As he whose brow with homely biggen bound Snores out the watch of night. O majesty, When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit	 Like a rich armor worn in heat of day, That scald’st with safety. By his gates of breath There lies a downy feather which stirs not; Did he suspire, that light and weightless down Perforce must move. My gracious lord, my father,	 This sleep is sound indeed. This is a sleep That from this golden rigol hath divorced So many English kings. Thy due from me Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood, Which nature, love, and filial tenderness	 Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously. My due from thee is this imperial crown, Which, as immediate from thy place and blood, Derives itself to me. He puts on the crown. Lo, where it sits,	 Which God shall guard. 

And, put the world’s whole strength Into one giant arm, it shall not force This lineal honor from me.This from thee Will I to mine leave, as ’tis left to me. 

<ACTION>He exits with the crown.</ACTION> 

KING , <ACTION> rising up in his bed</ACTION> Warwick! Gloucester! Clarence! 

<ACTION>Enter Warwick, Gloucester, Clarence, and others.</ACTION> 

THOMAS OF CLARENCE  Doth the King call? 

WARWICK What would your Majesty? How fares your Grace? 

KING Why did you leave me here alone, my lords?	 

THOMAS OF CLARENCE We left the Prince my brother here, my liege, Who undertook to sit and watch by you. 

KING The Prince of Wales? Where is he? Let me see him. He is not here. 

WARWICK This door is open. He is gone this way.	 

HUMPHREY OF GLOUCESTER He came not through the chamber where we stayed. 

KING Where is the crown? Who took it from my pillow? 

WARWICK When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here. 

KING The Prince hath ta’en it hence. Go seek him out.	 Is he so hasty that he doth suppose my sleep my death? Find him, my Lord of Warwick. Chide him hither. 

<ACTION>Warwick exits.</ACTION> 

This part of his conjoins with my disease And helps to end me. See, sons, what things you	 are, How quickly nature falls into revolt When gold becomes her object! For this the foolish overcareful fathers Have broke their sleep with thoughts,	 Their brains with care, their bones with industry. For this they have engrossèd and piled up The cankered heaps of strange-achievèd gold. For this they have been thoughtful to invest Their sons with arts and martial exercises—	 When, like the bee, tolling from every flower The virtuous sweets, Our thighs packed with wax, our mouths with honey, We bring it to the hive and, like the bees, Are murdered for our pains. This bitter taste Yields his engrossments to the ending father. 

<ACTION>Enter Warwick.</ACTION> 

Now where is he that will not stay so long Till his friend sickness hath determined me? 

WARWICK My lord, I found the Prince in the next room,	 Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks, With such a deep demeanor in great sorrow That tyranny, which never quaffed but blood, Would, by beholding him, have washed his knife With gentle eyedrops. He is coming hither.	 

KING But wherefore did he take away the crown? 

<ACTION>Enter Prince Harry with the crown.</ACTION> 

Lo where he comes.—Come hither to me, Harry.— Depart the chamber. Leave us here alone. 

<ACTION>Gloucester, Clarence, Warwick, and others exit.</ACTION> 

PRINCE I never thought to hear you speak again. 

KING Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought. I stay too long by thee; I weary thee. Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honors Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth, Thou seek’st the greatness that will overwhelm	 thee. Stay but a little, for my cloud of dignity Is held from falling with so weak a wind That it will quickly drop. My day is dim. Thou hast stol’n that which after some few hours	 Were thine without offense, and at my death Thou hast sealed up my expectation. Thy life did manifest thou loved’st me not, And thou wilt have me die assured of it. Thou hid’st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,	 Whom thou hast whetted on thy stony heart To stab at half an hour of my life. What, canst thou not forbear me half an hour? Then get thee gone, and dig my grave thyself, And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear	 That thou art crownèd, not that I am dead. Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head; Only compound me with forgotten dust. Give that which gave thee life unto the worms. 

Pluck down my officers, break my decrees, For now a time is come to mock at form.Harry the Fifth is crowned. Up, vanity, Down, royal state, all you sage councillors, hence,	 And to the English court assemble now, From every region, apes of idleness. Now, neighbor confines, purge you of your scum. Have you a ruffian that will swear, drink, dance, Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit	 The oldest sins the newest kind of ways? Be happy, he will trouble you no more. England shall double gild his treble guilt. England shall give him office, honor, might, For the fifth Harry from curbed license plucks	 The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent. O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows! When that my care could not withhold thy riots, What wilt thou do when riot is thy care? O, thou wilt be a wilderness again, Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants. 

PRINCE ,  <ACTION>placing the crown on the pillow</ACTION> O pardon me, my liege! But for my tears, The moist impediments unto my speech, I had forestalled this dear and deep rebuke	 Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard The course of it so far. There is your crown, And He that wears the crown immortally Long guard it yours. <ACTION>He kneels. </ACTION> If I affect it more	 Than as your honor and as your renown, Let me no more from this obedience rise, Which my most inward true and duteous spirit Teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending. God witness with me, when I here came in	 And found no course of breath within your Majesty, How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign, O, let me in my present wildness die And never live to show th’ incredulous world The noble change that I have purposèd. Coming to look on you, thinking you dead, And dead almost, my liege, to think you were, I spake unto this crown as having sense, And thus upbraided it: “The care on thee depending	 Hath fed upon the body of my father; Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold. 

Other, less fine in carat, is more precious, Preserving life in med’cine potable; But thou, most fine, most honored, most renowned,	 Hast eat thy bearer up.” Thus, my most royal liege, Accusing it, I put it on my head To try with it, as with an enemy That had before my face murdered my father, The quarrel of a true inheritor.But if it did infect my blood with joy Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride, If any rebel or vain spirit of mine Did with the least affection of a welcome Give entertainment to the might of it,	 Let God forever keep it from my head And make me as the poorest vassal is That doth with awe and terror kneel to it. 

KING O my son, God put it in thy mind to take it hence 335 That thou mightst win the more thy father’s love, Pleading so wisely in excuse of it. Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed And hear, I think, the very latest counsel That ever I shall breathe. 340 

The Prince rises from his knees and sits near the bed. 

God knows, my son, By what bypaths and indirect crook’d ways I met this crown, and I myself know well How troublesome it sat upon my head. To thee it shall descend with better quiet, 345 Better opinion, better confirmation, For all the soil of the achievement goes With me into the earth. It seemed in me But as an honor snatched with boist’rous hand, And I had many living to upbraid 350 My gain of it by their assistances, Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed, Wounding supposèd peace. All these bold fears Thou seest with peril I have answerèd, For all my reign hath been but as a scene 355 Acting that argument. And now my death Changes the mood, for what in me was purchased Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort. So thou the garland wear’st successively. 

Yet though thou stand’st more sure than I could do, 360 Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green, And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends, Have but their stings and teeth newly ta’en out, By whose fell working I was first advanced 365 And by whose power I well might lodge a fear To be again displaced; which to avoid, I cut them off and had a purpose now To lead out many to the Holy Land, Lest rest and lying still might make them look 370 Too near unto my state.Therefore, my Harry, Be it thy course to busy giddy minds With foreign quarrels, that action, hence borne out, May waste the memory of the former days. 375 More would I, but my lungs are wasted so That strength of speech is utterly denied me. How I came by the crown, O God forgive, And grant it may with thee in true peace live. 

PRINCE My gracious liege, You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me. Then plain and right must my possession be, Which I with more than with a common pain ’Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain. 

<ACTION>Enter John of Lancaster and others.</ACTION> 

KING Look, look, here comes my John of Lancaster.	 

JOHN OF LANCASTER Health, peace, and happiness to my royal father. 

KING Thou bring’st me happiness and peace, son John, But health, alack, with youthful wings is flown From this bare withered trunk. Upon thy sight My worldly business makes a period.	 Where is my Lord of Warwick? 

PRINCE My Lord of Warwick. 

<ACTION>Enter Warwick.</ACTION> 

KING Doth any name particular belong Unto the lodging where I first did swoon? 

WARWICK ’Tis called Jerusalem, my noble lord.	 

KING Laud be to God! Even there my life must end. It hath been prophesied to me many years, I should not die but in Jerusalem, Which vainly I supposed the Holy Land. But bear me to that chamber; there I’ll lie.	 In that Jerusalem shall Harry die. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
