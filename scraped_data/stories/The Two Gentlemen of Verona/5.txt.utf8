<ACTION>Enter Lance, weeping, with his dog, Crab.</ACTION> 

LANCE Nay, ’twill be this hour ere I have done weeping. All the kind of the Lances have this very fault. I have received my proportion like the Prodigious Son and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial’s court. I think Crab my dog be the sourest-natured dog that	 lives: my mother weeping, my father wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat wringing her hands, and all our house in a great perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed one tear. He is a stone, a very pibble stone, and has no more pity	 in him than a dog. A Jew would have wept to have seen our parting. Why, my grandam, having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my parting. Nay, I’ll show you the manner of it. <ACTION>He takes off hisshoes.</ACTION> This shoe is my father. No, this left shoe is	 my father; no, no, this left shoe is my mother. Nay, that cannot be so neither. Yes, it is so, it is so; it hath the worser sole. This shoe with the hole in it is my mother; and this my father. 

A vengeance on ’t, there ’tis!Now sir, this staff is my sister, for, look you, she	 is as white as a lily and as small as a wand. This hat is Nan, our maid. I am the dog. No, the dog is himself, and I am the dog. O, the dog is me, and I am myself. Ay, so, so. Now come I to my father: “Father, your blessing.” Now should not the shoe	 speak a word for weeping. Now should I kiss my father. <ACTION>He kisses one shoe</ACTION> . Well, he weeps on. Now come I to my mother. O, that she could speak now like a wold woman! Well, I kiss her. <ACTION>He kisses theother shoe.</ACTION> Why, there ’tis; here’s my mother’s	 breath up and down. Now come I to my sister. Mark the moan she makes! Now the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a word. But see how I lay the dust with my tears. 

<ACTION>Enter Pantino.</ACTION> 

PANTINO Lance, away, away! Aboard. Thy master is	 shipped, and thou art to post after with oars. What’s the matter? Why weep’st thou, man? Away, ass. You’ll lose the tide if you tarry any longer. 

LANCE It is no matter if the tied were lost, for it is the unkindest tied that ever any man tied.	 

PANTINO What’s the unkindest tide? 

LANCE Why, he that’s tied here, Crab my dog. 

PANTINO Tut, man. I mean thou ’lt lose the flood and, in losing the flood, lose thy voyage and, in losing thy voyage, lose thy master and, in losing thy master,	 lose thy service and, in losing thy service— <ACTION>Lancecovers Pantino’s mouth.</ACTION> Why dost thou stop my mouth? 

LANCE For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue. 

PANTINO Where should I lose my tongue?	 

LANCE In thy tale. 

PANTINO In thy tail! 

LANCE Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and the service, and the tied. Why, man, if the river were dry, I am able to fill it with my tears; if the	 wind were down, I could drive the boat with my sighs. 

PANTINO Come. Come away, man. I was sent to call thee. 

LANCE Sir, call me what thou dar’st.	 

PANTINO Wilt thou go? 

LANCE  Well, I will go. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
