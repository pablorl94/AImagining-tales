Chapter 4.XXXIV. 

My uncle Toby's head at that time was full of other matters, so that it was not till the demolition of Dunkirk, when all the other civilities of Europe were settled, that he found leisure to return this. 

This made an armistice (that is, speaking with regard to my uncle Toby--but with respect to Mrs. Wadman, a vacancy)--of almost eleven years. But in all cases of this nature, as it is the second blow, happen at what distance of time it will, which makes the fray--I chuse for that reason to call these the amours of my uncle Toby with Mrs. Wadman, rather than the amours of Mrs. Wadman with my uncle Toby. 

This is not a distinction without a difference. 

It is not like the affair of an old hat cock'd--and a cock'd old hat, about which your reverences have so often been at odds with one another--but there is a difference here in the nature of things-- 

And let me tell you, gentry, a wide one too.
