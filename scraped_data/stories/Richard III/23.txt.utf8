<ACTION>Enter Richmond, Sir William Brandon, Oxford,Dorset, Herbert, Blunt, and others who set upRichmond’s tent.</ACTION> 

RICHMOND The weary sun hath made a golden set,	 And by the bright track of his fiery car Gives token of a goodly day tomorrow.— Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.— Give me some ink and paper in my tent; I’ll draw the form and model of our battle,	 Limit each leader to his several charge, And part in just proportion our small power.— My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon, And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me. The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment.—	 Good Captain Blunt, bear my goodnight to him, And by the second hour in the morning Desire the Earl to see me in my tent. Yet one thing more, good captain, do for me. Where is Lord Stanley quartered, do you know? 

BLUNT Unless I have mista’en his colors much, Which well I am assured I have not done, His regiment lies half a mile, at least, South from the mighty power of the King. 

RICHMOND If without peril it be possible,	 Sweet Blunt, make some good means to speak with him, And give him from me this most needful note. 

<ACTION>He gives a paper.</ACTION> 

BLUNT Upon my life, my lord, I’ll undertake it, And so God give you quiet rest tonight.	 

RICHMOND Good night, good Captain Blunt.	Blunt exits. Come, gentlemen, Let us consult upon tomorrow’s business. Into my tent. The dew is raw and cold. 

<ACTION>Richmond, Brandon, Dorset, Herbert, and Oxfordwithdraw into the tent. The others exit.</ACTION>
