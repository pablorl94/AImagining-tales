This is a gothic thriller type story with a twist ending.

It's about Bannadonna, a somewhat sinister architect, and the bell-tower he built.

The most difficult part of building the tower was the crafting of the giant bell.

During the melting and forging process, the workmen were scared.

Bannadonna was worried their fear would cause them to shirk and damage the bell, so he hits the chief on the head with a giant ladle, killing him.

A bit of the ladle falls into the smelting

As a result, the bell has a blemish; but Bannadonna covers it over.

Bad move, Bannadonna.

Also maybe you shouldn't have murdered a guy. Geez.

But the townspeople just shrug off the homicide as a sign of artistic temperament.

Anyway, Bannadonna is secluded in his workshop working on some other thing.

This is the secret bit setting up the surprise ending, if you couldn't tell.

The covered over thing is eventually moved to the belfry.

The chief-magistrate and one of his buddies go up to the belfry to try to figure out what the secret is. But Bannadonna won't tell them.

They think it's sort of human like. (Cue ominous music.)

Anyway, he shows them a complicated clock/bell thing, which is to ring the hours the next day.

Each hour has a female statue by it.

The magistrates are freaked out because the statues don't all look alike, and one looks like the prophetess Debra from a famous painting by Del Fonca (who appears to be a painter made up by Melville.)

All of this is supposed to be somewhat ominous, though it's rather confused. Why would it be weird for statues to not look exactly alike?

This sort of has a B-horror movie feel, where the music and the overacting lets you know that things are supposed to be scary even when the plot doesn't make a lot of sense.

Anyway, Bannadonna explains at length that you can't necessarily make all statues look alike in an era before industrial standardization.

They head downstairs, and the magistrate and his buddy think they hear someone moving upstairs in the belfry. Bannadonna assures them it's just the Frankenstein monster and the Terminator doing a rumba.

No, he doesn't say that. He says nothing's there.

More ominous music.

And Bannadonna locks them out. (Most ominous music.)

The next day people gather to hear the bell ringâ€¦but it doesn't.

So they go upstairs and find some sort of statue/robot thing standing over his bleeding body. (Crescendo on that ominous music.)

It seems that Bannadonna built a kind of human-looking mechanism to strike the hour, but he got caught in it, and so it bashed him to death as it tried to strike the hour.

It takes Melville forever to say this, and it's all couched in maybes and superstitious burbling and ominous music, but that's the gist of it.

So it's basically the Frankenstein story, but the monster never actually comes to life, which makes it all seem kind of pointless.

At Bannadonna's funeral, the bell is rung, but ends up crashing down because of a weakness at its top (that's the bit Bannadonna tried to hide.)

They make a new bell, which works for a while, but then on the one-year anniversary of the tower, an earthquake knocks it over.

Strange event, Shmoopers. Strange, mysterious events. Don't mess with nature, scientists or bell ringers. Vincent Price now wishes you good night.
