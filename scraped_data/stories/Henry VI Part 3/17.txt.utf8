<ACTION>Enter Richard of Gloucester, Lord Hastings,and Sir William Stanley, with Soldiers,all wearing the white rose.</ACTION> 

RICHARD Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley, Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither Into this chiefest thicket of the park. Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother, Is prisoner to the Bishop here, at whose hands He hath good usage and great liberty, And, often but attended with weak guard, Comes hunting this way to disport himself. I have advertised him by secret means That, if about this hour he make this way Under the color of his usual game, He shall here find his friends with horse and men To set him free from his captivity. 

<ACTION>Enter King Edward, wearing the white rose,and a Huntsman with him.</ACTION> 

HUNTSMAN This way, my lord, for this way lies the game. 

KING EDWARD Nay, this way, man. See where the huntsmen stand.—	 Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest, Stand you thus close to steal the Bishop’s deer? 

RICHARD Brother, the time and case requireth haste. Your horse stands ready at the park corner.	 

KING EDWARD But whither shall we then? 

HASTINGS To Lynn, my lord, and shipped from thence to Flanders. 

RICHARD Well guessed, believe me, for that was my meaning. 

KING EDWARD Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.	 

RICHARD But wherefore stay we? ’Tis no time to talk. 

KING EDWARD Huntsman, what sayst thou? Wilt thou go along? 

HUNTSMAN Better do so than tarry and be hanged. 

RICHARD Come then, away! Let’s ha’ no more ado. 

KING EDWARD Bishop, farewell; shield thee from Warwick’s frown,	30 And pray that I may repossess the crown. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
