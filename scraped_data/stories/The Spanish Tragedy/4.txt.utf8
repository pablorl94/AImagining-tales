[CHORUS.] 

ANDREA.  Come we for this from depth of vnder ground,-- To see him feast that gaue me my deaths wound? These pleasant sights are sorrow to my soule: nothing but league and loue and banqueting! 

REUENGE.  Be still, Andrea;  ere we go from hence, Ile turne their freendship into fell despight, Their loue to mortall hate, their day to night, Their hope into dispaire, their peace in warre, Their ioyes to paine, their blisse to miserie. 

ACTUS SECUNDUS.
