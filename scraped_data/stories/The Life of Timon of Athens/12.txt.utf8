<ACTION>Enter Timon in the woods, with a spade.</ACTION> 

TIMON O blessèd breeding sun, draw from the Earth Rotten humidity! Below thy sister’s orb Infect the air! Twinned brothers of one womb, Whose procreation, residence, and birth Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes,	 The greater scorns the lesser. Not nature, To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune But by contempt of nature. Raise me this beggar, and deny ’t that lord; The Senators shall bear contempt hereditary,	 The beggar native honor. It is the pasture lards the brother’s sides, The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares In purity of manhood stand upright	 And say “This man’s a flatterer”? If one be, So are they all, for every grise of fortune Is smoothed by that below. The learnèd pate Ducks to the golden fool. All’s obliquy. There’s nothing level in our cursèd natures	 But direct villainy. Therefore be abhorred All feasts, societies, and throngs of men. His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains. Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots! Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate	 With thy most operant poison! <ACTION>(Digging, he findsgold.) </ACTION> What is here? 

Gold?Yellow, glittering, precious gold? No, gods, I am no idle votarist. Roots, you clear heavens! Thus much of this will	 make Black white, foul fair, wrong right, Base noble, old young, coward valiant. Ha, you gods! Why this? What this, you gods? Why, this		 Will lug your priests and servants from your sides, Pluck stout men’s pillows from below their heads. This yellow slave Will knit and break religions, bless th’ accursed, Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves	 And give them title, knee, and approbation With senators on the bench. This is it That makes the wappened widow wed again; She whom the spital house and ulcerous sores Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices	 To th’ April day again. Come, damnèd earth, Thou common whore of mankind, that puts odds Among the rout of nations, I will make thee Do thy right nature. <ACTION>(March afar off. )</ACTION> Ha? A drum? Thou ’rt quick,	 But yet I’ll bury thee. Thou ’lt go, strong thief, When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand. Nay, stay thou out for earnest. 

<ACTION>He buries the gold, keeping some out.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Alcibiades, with Drum and Fife, in warlikemanner, and Phrynia and Timandra.</ACTION> 

ALCIBIADES What art thou there? Speak. 

TIMON A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart	 For showing me again the eyes of man! 

ALCIBIADES What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee That art thyself a man? 

TIMON I am Misanthropos and hate mankind. For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,	 That I might love thee something. 

ALCIBIADES I know thee well. But in thy fortunes am unlearned and strange. 

TIMON I know thee too, and more than that I know thee I not desire to know. Follow thy drum.	 With man’s blood paint the ground gules, gules! Religious canons, civil laws are cruel. Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine Hath in her more destruction than thy sword, For all her cherubin look.	 

PHRYNIA Thy lips rot off! 

TIMON I will not kiss thee. Then the rot returns To thine own lips again. 

ALCIBIADES How came the noble Timon to this change? 

TIMON As the moon does, by wanting light to give.	 But then renew I could not, like the moon; There were no suns to borrow of. 

ALCIBIADES Noble Timon, what friendship may I do thee? 

TIMON None, but to maintain my opinion. 

ALCIBIADES What is it, Timon?	 

TIMON  Promise me friendship, but perform none. If thou wilt not promise, the gods plague thee, for thou art a man. If thou dost perform, confound thee, for thou art a man. 

ALCIBIADES I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.	 

TIMON Thou saw’st them when I had prosperity. 

ALCIBIADES I see them now. Then was a blessèd time. 

TIMON As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots. 

TIMANDRA Is this th’ Athenian minion whom the world Voiced so regardfully? 

TIMON  Art thou Timandra? 

TIMANDRA  Yes. 

TIMON Be a whore still. They love thee not that use thee. Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust. Make use of thy salt hours. Season the slaves	 For tubs and baths. Bring down rose-cheeked youth To the tub-fast and the diet. 

TIMANDRA Hang thee, monster! 

ALCIBIADES Pardon him, sweet Timandra, for his wits Are drowned and lost in his calamities.—	 I have but little gold of late, brave Timon, The want whereof doth daily make revolt In my penurious band. I have heard and grieved How cursèd Athens, mindless of thy worth, Forgetting thy great deeds when neighbor states,	 But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them— 

TIMON I prithee, beat thy drum and get thee gone. 

ALCIBIADES I am thy friend and pity thee, dear Timon. 

TIMON How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble? I had rather be alone.	 

ALCIBIADES Why, fare thee well. Here is some gold for thee. 

TIMON  Keep it. I cannot eat it. 

ALCIBIADES When I have laid proud Athens on a heap— 

TIMON Warr’st thou ’gainst Athens? 

ALCIBIADES Ay, Timon, and have cause.	 

TIMON The gods confound them all in thy conquest, And thee after, when thou hast conquered! 

ALCIBIADES Why me, Timon? 

TIMON That by killing of villains Thou wast born to conquer my country. Put up thy gold. Go on. Here’s gold. Go on. Be as a planetary plague when Jove Will o’er some high-viced city hang his poison In the sick air. Let not thy sword skip one. Pity not honored age for his white beard;	 He is an usurer. Strike me the counterfeit matron; It is her habit only that is honest, Herself’s a bawd. Let not the virgin’s cheek Make soft thy trenchant sword, for those milk paps, That through the window-bars bore at men’s eyes,	 Are not within the leaf of pity writ, But set them down horrible traitors. Spare not the babe, Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;	135 Think it a bastard whom the oracle Hath doubtfully pronounced the throat shall cut, And mince it sans remorse. Swear against objects; Put armor on thine ears and on thine eyes, Whose proof nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,	 Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding, Shall pierce a jot. <ACTION>(He offers gold. )</ACTION> There’s gold to pay thy soldiers. Make large confusion and, thy fury spent, Confounded be thyself! 

Speak not.Begone. 

ALCIBIADES Hast thou gold yet? I’ll take the gold thou givest me, Not all thy counsel. 

TIMON Dost thou or dost thou not, heaven’s curse upon thee! 

BOTH WOMEN Give us some gold, good Timon. Hast thou more? 

TIMON Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,	 And to make whores a bawd. Hold up, you sluts, Your aprons mountant.  <ACTION>(He begins throwing goldinto their aprons.) </ACTION> You are not oathable, Although I know you’ll swear—terribly swear Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues	 Th’ immortal gods that hear you. Spare your oaths. I’ll trust to your conditions. Be whores still. And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you, Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up. Let your close fire predominate his smoke,	 And be no turncoats. Yet may your pains six months Be quite contrary. And thatch your poor thin roofs With burdens of the dead—some that were hanged, No matter; wear them, betray with them. Whore still.	 Paint till a horse may mire upon your face. A pox of wrinkles! 

BOTH WOMEN Well, more gold. What then? Believe ’t that we’ll do anything for gold. 

TIMON Consumptions sow	 In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins, And mar men’s spurring. Crack the lawyer’s voice, That he may never more false title plead Nor sound his quillets shrilly. Hoar the flamen, That scolds against the quality of flesh	 And not believes himself. Down with the nose— Down with it flat, take the bridge quite away— Of him that, his particular to foresee, Smells from the general weal. Make curled-pate ruffians bald,	 And let the unscarred braggarts of the war Derive some pain from you. Plague all, That your activity may defeat and quell The source of all erection. There’s more gold. Do you damn others, and let this damn you,	 And ditches grave you all! 

BOTH WOMEN More counsel with more money, bounteous Timon. 

TIMON More whore, more mischief first! I have given you earnest. 

ALCIBIADES Strike up the drum towards Athens.—Farewell,	 Timon. If I thrive well, I’ll visit thee again. 

TIMON If I hope well, I’ll never see thee more. 

ALCIBIADES I never did thee harm. 

TIMON Yes, thou spok’st well of me.	 

ALCIBIADES  Call’st thou that harm? 

TIMON Men daily find it. Get thee away, and take Thy beagles with thee. 

ALCIBIADES ,  <ACTION>to the Women</ACTION> We but offend him.— Strike. 

<ACTION> The drum sounds; all but Timon exit.</ACTION> 

TIMON That nature, being sick of man’s unkindness, Should yet be hungry! (He digs.) Common mother, thou Whose womb unmeasurable and infinite breast Teems and feeds all; whose selfsame mettle—	 Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puffed— Engenders the black toad and adder blue, The gilded newt and eyeless venomed worm, With all th’ abhorrèd births below crisp heaven Whereon Hyperion’s quick’ning fire doth shine:	 Yield him who all thy human sons do hate, From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root! Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb; Let it no more bring out ingrateful man. Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;	 Teem with new monsters, whom thy upward face Hath to the marbled mansion all above Never presented. O, a root! Dear thanks! Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plow-torn leas, Whereof ingrateful man with liquorish drafts	220 And morsels unctuous greases his pure mind, That from it all consideration slips— 

<ACTION>Enter Apemantus.</ACTION> 

More man? Plague, plague! 

APEMANTUS I was directed hither. Men report Thou dost affect my manners and dost use them.	 

TIMON ’Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog, Whom I would imitate. Consumption catch thee! 

APEMANTUS This is in thee a nature but infected, A poor unmanly melancholy sprung From change of future. Why this spade? This place?	 This slavelike habit and these looks of care? Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft, Hug their diseased perfumes, and have forgot That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods By putting on the cunning of a carper.	 Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thrive By that which has undone thee. Hinge thy knee, And let his very breath whom thou ’lt observe Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain, And call it excellent. Thou wast told thus.	 Thou gav’st thine ears, like tapsters that bade welcome, To knaves and all approachers. ’Tis most just That thou turn rascal. Had’st thou wealth again, Rascals should have ’t. Do not assume my likeness.	 

TIMON Were I like thee, I’d throw away myself. 

APEMANTUS Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself— A madman so long, now a fool. What, think’st That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain, Will put thy shirt on warm? Will these moist trees,	 That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels And skip when thou point’st out? Will the cold brook, Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste To cure thy o’ernight’s surfeit? Call the creatures Whose naked natures live in all the spite	 Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhousèd trunks, To the conflicting elements exposed, Answer mere nature. Bid them flatter thee. O, thou shalt find— 

TIMON A fool of thee. Depart.	 

APEMANTUS I love thee better now than e’er I did. 

TIMON I hate thee worse. 

APEMANTUS Why? 

TIMON Thou flatter’st misery. 

APEMANTUS I flatter not but say thou art a caitiff.	 

TIMON  Why dost thou seek me out? 

APEMANTUS To vex thee. 

TIMON Always a villain’s office or a fool’s. Dost please thyself in ’t? 

APEMANTUS Ay.	 

TIMON What, a knave too? 

APEMANTUS If thou didst put this sour cold habit on To castigate thy pride, ’twere well, but thou Dost it enforcedly. Thou ’dst courtier be again Wert thou not beggar. Willing misery	 Outlives incertain pomp, is crowned before; The one is filling still, never complete, The other at high wish. Best state, contentless, Hath a distracted and most wretched being, Worse than the worst, content.	 Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable. 

TIMON Not by his breath that is more miserable. Thou art a slave whom Fortune’s tender arm With favor never clasped but bred a dog. Hadst thou, like us from our first swathe, proceeded	 The sweet degrees that this brief world affords To such as may the passive drugs of it Freely command, thou wouldst have plunged thyself In general riot, melted down thy youth	 In different beds of lust, and never learned The icy precepts of respect, but followed The sugared game before thee. But myself— Who had the world as my confectionary, The mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of	 men At duty, more than I could frame employment, That numberless upon me stuck as leaves Do on the oak, have with one winter’s brush Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare,	 For every storm that blows—I to bear this, That never knew but better, is some burden. Thy nature did commence in sufferance. Time Hath made thee hard in ’t. Why shouldst thou hate men? They never flattered thee. What hast thou given? If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag, Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff To some she-beggar and compounded thee Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, begone. 

If thou hadst not been born the worst of men, Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.

APEMANTUS Art thou proud yet? 

TIMON Ay, that I am not thee. 

APEMANTUS I, that I was no prodigal.	 

TIMON I, that I am one now. Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee, I’d give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone. That the whole life of Athens were in this! Thus would I eat it.	  

<ACTION>He gnaws a root.</ACTION> 

APEMANTUS ,  <ACTION>offering food</ACTION> Here, I will mend thy feast. 

TIMON First mend my company. Take away thyself. 

APEMANTUS So I shall mend mine own by th’ lack of thine. 

TIMON ’Tis not well mended so; it is but botched. If not, I would it were.	 

APEMANTUS  What wouldst thou have to Athens? 

TIMON Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt, Tell them there I have gold. Look, so I have. 

APEMANTUS Here is no use for gold. 

TIMON  The best and truest,	 For here it sleeps and does no hired harm. 

APEMANTUS  Where liest a-nights, Timon? 

TIMON  Under that’s above me. Where feed’st thou a-days, Apemantus? 

APEMANTUS Where my stomach finds meat, or rather	 where I eat it. 

TIMON  Would poison were obedient and knew my mind! 

APEMANTUS Where wouldst thou send it? 

TIMON  To sauce thy dishes.	 

APEMANTUS The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the extremity of both ends. When thou wast in thy gilt and thy perfume, they mocked thee for too much curiosity. In thy rags thou know’st none, but art despised for the contrary. There’s a medlar for thee. Eat it. 

TIMON On what I hate I feed not. 

APEMANTUS Dost hate a medlar? 

TIMON  Ay, though it look like thee. 

APEMANTUS An thou ’dst hated meddlers sooner, thou	 shouldst have loved thyself better now. What man didst thou ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means? 

TIMON  Who, without those means thou talk’st of, didst thou ever know beloved?	 

APEMANTUS Myself. 

TIMON I understand thee. Thou hadst some means to keep a dog. 

APEMANTUS What things in the world canst thou nearest compare to thy flatterers?	 

TIMON Women nearest, but men—men are the things themselves. What wouldst thou do with the world, Apemantus, if it lay in thy power? 

APEMANTUS  Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men. 

TIMON Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion	 of men and remain a beast with the beasts? 

APEMANTUS Ay, Timon. 

TIMON  A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t’ attain to! If thou wert the lion, the fox would beguile thee. If thou wert the lamb, the fox would	 eat thee. If thou wert the fox, the lion would suspect thee when peradventure thou wert accused by the ass. If thou wert the ass, thy dullness would torment thee, and still thou lived’st but as a breakfast to the wolf. If thou wert the wolf, thy greediness	 would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner. Wert thou the unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury. Wert thou a bear, thou wouldst be killed by the horse.	 Wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by the leopard. Wert thou a leopard, thou wert germane to the lion, and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life. All thy safety were remotion, and thy defense absence. What beast couldst thou be	 that were not subject to a beast? And what a beast art thou already that seest not thy loss in transformation! 

APEMANTUS If thou couldst please me with speaking to me, thou mightst have hit upon it here. The commonwealth	 of Athens is become a forest of beasts. 

TIMON How, has the ass broke the wall that thou art out of the city? 

APEMANTUS  Yonder comes a poet and a painter. The plague of company light upon thee! I will fear to	 catch it and give way. When I know not what else to do, I’ll see thee again. 

TIMON When there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt be welcome. I had rather be a beggar’s dog than Apemantus.	 

APEMANTUS Thou art the cap of all the fools alive. 

TIMON Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon! 

APEMANTUS A plague on thee! Thou art too bad to curse. 

TIMON All villains that do stand by thee are pure. 

APEMANTUS There is no leprosy but what thou speak’st.	 

TIMON If I name thee. I’ll beat thee, but I should infect my hands. 

APEMANTUS  I would my tongue could rot them off! 

TIMON Away, thou issue of a mangy dog! Choler does kill me that thou art alive.	 I swoon to see thee. 

APEMANTUS Would thou wouldst burst! 

TIMON Away, thou tedious rogue! I am sorry I shall lose a stone by thee. 

<ACTION>Timon throws a stone at Apemantus.</ACTION> 

APEMANTUS Beast!	 

TIMON  Slave! 

APEMANTUS Toad! 

TIMON  Rogue, rogue, rogue! I am sick of this false world, and will love nought But even the mere necessities upon ’t.	 Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave. Lie where the light foam of the sea may beat Thy gravestone daily. Make thine epitaph, That death in me at others’ lives may laugh. <ACTION>(To his gold.)</ACTION> O thou sweet king-killer and dear	 divorce ’Twixt natural son and sire, thou bright defiler Of Hymen’s purest bed, thou valiant Mars, Thou ever young, fresh, loved, and delicate wooer, Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow That lies on Dian’s lap; thou visible god, That sold’rest close impossibilities And mak’st them kiss, that speak’st with every tongue To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts,	 Think thy slave, man, rebels, and by thy virtue Set them into confounding odds, that beasts May have the world in empire! 

APEMANTUS  Would ’twere so! But not till I am dead. I’ll say thou ’st gold;	 Thou wilt be thronged to shortly. 

TIMON  Thronged to? 

APEMANTUS  Ay. 

TIMON Thy back, I prithee. 

APEMANTUS Live and love thy misery. 

TIMON Long live so, and so die. I am quit. 

<ACTION>Enter the Banditti.</ACTION> 

APEMANTUS More things like men.—Eat, Timon, and abhor them.	 

<ACTION>Apemantus exits.</ACTION> 

FIRST BANDIT Where should he have this gold? It is some poor fragment, some slender ort of his	 remainder. The mere want of gold and the falling-from of his friends drove him into this melancholy. 

SECOND BANDIT It is noised he hath a mass of treasure. 

THIRD BANDIT  Let us make the assay upon him. If he care not for ’t, he will supply us easily. If he covetously	 reserve it, how shall ’s get it? 

SECOND BANDIT True, for he bears it not about him. ’Tis hid. 

FIRST BANDIT Is not this he? 

OTHERS  Where?	 

SECOND BANDIT ’Tis his description. 

THIRD BANDIT  He. I know him. 

ALL Save thee, Timon. 

TIMON  Now, thieves? 

ALL Soldiers, not thieves.	 

TIMON Both, too, and women’s sons. 

ALL We are not thieves, but men that much do want. 

TIMON Your greatest want is, you want much of meat. Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots. Within this mile break forth a hundred springs.	 The oaks bear mast, the briars scarlet hips. The bounteous huswife Nature on each bush Lays her full mess before you. Want? Why want? 

FIRST BANDIT We cannot live on grass, on berries, water, As beasts and birds and fishes.	 

TIMON Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds and fishes; You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con That you are thieves professed, that you work not In holier shapes, for there is boundless theft In limited professions. Rascal thieves,	 Here’s gold. <ACTION> (He gives them gold. )</ACTION> Go, suck the subtle blood o’ th’ grape Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth, And so ’scape hanging. Trust not the physician; His antidotes are poison, and he slays	 More than you rob. Take wealth and lives together. Do, villainy, do, since you protest to do ’t, Like workmen. I’ll example you with thievery. The sun’s a thief and with his great attraction Robs the vast sea. The moon’s an arrant thief,	 And her pale fire she snatches from the sun. The sea’s a thief, whose liquid surge resolves The moon into salt tears. The earth’s a thief, That feeds and breeds by a composture stol’n From gen’ral excrement. Each thing’s a thief. The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power Has unchecked theft. Love not yourselves. Away! 

Rob one another.There’s more gold. <ACTION>(He gives themgold.) </ACTION> Cut throats. All that you meet are thieves. To Athens go. Break open shops. Nothing can you steal But thieves do lose it. Steal less for this I give you, And gold confound you howsoe’er! Amen. 

THIRD BANDIT  Has almost charmed me from my profession by persuading me to it.	 

FIRST BANDIT ’Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises us, not to have us thrive in our mystery. 

SECOND BANDIT I’ll believe him as an enemy and give over my trade.	 

FIRST BANDIT Let us first see peace in Athens. There is no time so miserable but a man may be true. 

<ACTION>Thieves exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Flavius the Steward, to Timon.</ACTION> 

FLAVIUS O you gods! Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord? Full of decay and flailing? O, monument	 And wonder of good deeds evilly bestowed! What an alteration of honor has desp’rate want made! What viler thing upon the Earth than friends, Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!	 How rarely does it meet with this time’s guise, When man was wished to love his enemies! Grant I may ever love, and rather woo Those that would mischief me than those that do! Has caught me in his eye. I will present	 My honest grief unto him and as my lord Still serve him with my life.—My dearest master. 

TIMON Away! What art thou? 

FLAVIUS  Have you forgot me, sir? 

TIMON Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men. Then, if thou grant’st thou ’rt a man, I have forgot thee. 

FLAVIUS  An honest poor servant of yours. 

TIMON  Then I know thee not. I never had honest man about me, I. All	 I kept were knaves to serve in meat to villains. 

FLAVIUS  The gods are witness, Ne’er did poor steward wear a truer grief For his undone lord than mine eyes for you. 

<ACTION>He weeps.</ACTION> 

TIMON What, dost thou weep? Come nearer, then. I love	 thee Because thou art a woman and disclaim’st Flinty mankind, whose eyes do never give But thorough lust and laughter. Pity’s sleeping. Strange times that weep with laughing, not with	 weeping! 

FLAVIUS I beg of you to know me, good my lord, T’ accept my grief, and, whilst this poor wealth lasts, To entertain me as your steward still. 

<ACTION>He offers money.</ACTION> 

TIMON  Had I a steward	 So true, so just, and now so comfortable? It almost turns my dangerous nature mild. Let me behold thy face. Surely this man Was born of woman. Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,	 You perpetual-sober gods. I do proclaim One honest man—mistake me not, but one; No more, I pray!—and he’s a steward. How fain would I have hated all mankind, And thou redeem’st thyself. But all, save thee,	 I fell with curses. Methinks thou art more honest now than wise, For by oppressing and betraying me Thou mightst have sooner got another service; For many so arrive at second masters	 Upon their first lord’s neck. But tell me true— For I must ever doubt, though ne’er so sure— Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous, A usuring kindness, and as rich men deal gifts, Expecting in return twenty for one?	 

FLAVIUS No, my most worthy master, in whose breast Doubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late. You should have feared false times when you did feast. Suspect still comes where an estate is least.	 That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love, Duty, and zeal to your unmatchèd mind, Care of your food and living. And believe it, My most honored lord, For any benefit that points to me,	 Either in hope or present, I’d exchange For this one wish, that you had power and wealth To requite me by making rich yourself. 

TIMON Look thee, ’tis so. Thou singly honest man, Here, take.  <ACTION>(Timon offers gold.)</ACTION> The gods out of my	 misery Has sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy, But thus conditioned: thou shalt build from men; Hate all, curse all, show charity to none, But let the famished flesh slide from the bone	 Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs What thou deniest to men; let prisons swallow ’em, Debts wither ’em to nothing; be men like blasted woods, And may diseases lick up their false bloods!	 And so farewell and thrive. 

FLAVIUS O, let me stay And comfort you, my master. 

TIMON  If thou hat’st curses, Stay not. Fly whilst thou art blest and free.	 Ne’er see thou man, and let me ne’er see thee. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
