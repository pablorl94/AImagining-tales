<ACTION>Enter two Grooms.</ACTION> 

FIRST GROOM More rushes, more rushes. 

SECOND GROOM The trumpets have sounded twice. 

FIRST GROOM ’Twill be two o’clock ere they come from the coronation. Dispatch, dispatch. 

<ACTION>Grooms exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Trumpets sound, and the King and his train pass overthe stage. After them enter Falstaff, Shallow, Pistol,Bardolph, and the Page.</ACTION> 

FALSTAFF Stand here by me, Master Robert Shallow. I	 will make the King do you grace. I will leer upon him as he comes by, and do but mark the countenance that he will give me. 

PISTOL God bless thy lungs, good knight! 

FALSTAFF Come here, Pistol, stand behind me.—O, if I	 had had time to have made new liveries, I would have bestowed the thousand pound I borrowed of you. But ’tis no matter. This poor show doth better. This doth infer the zeal I had to see him. 

SHALLOW  It doth so.	 

FALSTAFF It shows my earnestness of affection— 

SHALLOW It doth so. 

FALSTAFF   My devotion— 

SHALLOW  It doth, it doth, it doth. 

FALSTAFF As it were, to ride day and night, and not to	 deliberate, not to remember, not to have patience to shift me— 

SHALLOW  It is best, certain. 

FALSTAFF But to stand stained with travel and sweating with desire to see him, thinking of nothing else,	25 putting all affairs else in oblivion, as if there were nothing else to be done but to see him. 

PISTOL ’Tis semper idem, for obsque hoc nihil est; ’tis all in every part. 

SHALLOW  ’Tis so indeed.	 

PISTOL My knight, I will inflame thy noble liver, and make thee rage. Thy Doll and Helen of thy noble thoughts is in base durance and contagious prison, haled thither by most mechanical and dirty hand. Rouse up revenge from ebon den with fell Alecto’s	 snake, for Doll is in. Pistol speaks nought but truth. 

FALSTAFF I will deliver her. 

<ACTION>Shouts within. The trumpets sound.</ACTION> 

PISTOL There roared the sea, and trumpet-clangor sounds. 

<ACTION>Enter the King and his train.</ACTION> 

FALSTAFF God save thy Grace, King Hal, my royal Hal. 

PISTOL The heavens thee guard and keep, most royal	 imp of fame! 

FALSTAFF God save thee, my sweet boy! 

KING My Lord Chief Justice, speak to that vain man. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ,  <ACTION>to Falstaff</ACTION> Have you your wits? Know you what ’tis you speak?	 

FALSTAFF ,  <ACTION>to the King</ACTION> My king, my Jove, I speak to thee, my heart! 

KING I know thee not, old man. Fall to thy prayers. How ill white hairs becomes a fool and jester. I have long dreamt of such a kind of man, So surfeit-swelled, so old, and so profane;	 But being awaked, I do despise my dream. Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace; Leave gormandizing. Know the grave doth gape For thee thrice wider than for other men. Reply not to me with a fool-born jest. Presume not that I am the thing I was, For God doth know—so shall the world perceive— That I have turned away my former self. So will I those that kept me company. When thou dost hear I am as I have been,	 Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast, The tutor and the feeder of my riots. Till then I banish thee, on pain of death, As I have done the rest of my misleaders, Not to come near our person by ten mile. For competence of life I will allow you, That lack of means enforce you not to evils. And, as we hear you do reform yourselves, We will, according to your strengths and qualities, Give you advancement. To the Lord Chief Justice. 

Be it your charge, my lord, To see performed the tenor of my word.— Set on.

<ACTION>King and his train exit.</ACTION> 

FALSTAFF Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pound. 

SHALLOW  Yea, marry, Sir John, which I beseech you to	 let me have home with me. 

FALSTAFF That can hardly be, Master Shallow. Do not you grieve at this. I shall be sent for in private to him. Look you, he must seem thus to the world. Fear not your advancements. I will be the man yet	 that shall make you great. 

SHALLOW I cannot well perceive how, unless you should give me your doublet and stuff me out with straw. I beseech you, good Sir John, let me have five hundred of my thousand.	 

FALSTAFF Sir, I will be as good as my word. This that you heard was but a color. 

SHALLOW  A color that I fear you will die in, Sir John. 

FALSTAFF Fear no colors. Go with me to dinner.— Come, lieutenant Pistol.—Come, Bardolph.—I	 shall be sent for soon at night. 

<ACTION>Enter the Lord Chief Justice and Prince John, withOfficers.</ACTION> 

CHIEF JUSTICE Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet. Take all his company along with him. 

FALSTAFF   My lord, my lord — 

CHIEF JUSTICE I cannot now speak. I will hear you soon.—	 Take them away. 

PISTOL Si fortuna me tormenta, spero me contenta. 

<ACTION>All but John of Lancaster andChief Justice exit.</ACTION> 

JOHN OF LANCASTER I like this fair proceeding of the King’s. He hath intent his wonted followers Shall all be very well provided for,	 But all are banished till their conversations Appear more wise and modest to the world. 

CHIEF JUSTICE And so they are. 

JOHN OF LANCASTER The King hath called his parliament, my lord. 

CHIEF JUSTICE  He hath.	 

JOHN OF LANCASTER I will lay odds that, ere this year expire, We bear our civil swords and native fire As far as France. I heard a bird so sing, Whose music, to my thinking, pleased the King. Come, will you hence?	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
