<ACTION>Enter Armado and Mote, his page.</ACTION> 

ARMADO Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows melancholy? 

BOY A great sign, sir, that he will look sad. 

ARMADO Why, sadness is one and the selfsame thing, dear imp.	 

BOY No, no. O Lord, sir, no! 

ARMADO How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my tender juvenal? 

BOY By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough signior.	 

ARMADO  Why “tough signior”? Why “tough signior”? 

BOY  Why “tender juvenal”? Why “tender juvenal”? 

ARMADO I spoke it “tender juvenal” as a congruent epitheton appertaining to thy young days, which we may nominate “tender.”	 

BOY And I “tough signior” as an appurtenant title to your old time, which we may name “tough.” 

ARMADO  Pretty and apt. 

BOY How mean you, sir? I pretty and my saying apt, or I apt and my saying pretty?	 

ARMADO Thou pretty because little. 

BOY Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt? 

ARMADO And therefore apt, because quick. 

BOY Speak you this in my praise, master? 

ARMADO In thy condign praise.	 

BOY I will praise an eel with the same praise. 

ARMADO What, that an eel is ingenious? 

BOY That an eel is quick. 

ARMADO I do say thou art quick in answers. Thou heat’st my blood. 

BOY  I am answered, sir. 

ARMADO I love not to be crossed. 

BOY ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him. 

ARMADO I have promised to study three years with the	 Duke. 

BOY You may do it in an hour, sir. 

ARMADO Impossible. 

BOY  How many is one thrice told? 

ARMADO I am ill at reckoning. It fitteth the spirit of a	 tapster. 

BOY You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir. 

ARMADO I confess both. They are both the varnish of a complete man. 

BOY Then I am sure you know how much the gross	 sum of deuce-ace amounts to. 

ARMADO It doth amount to one more than two. 

BOY  Which the base vulgar do call “three.” 

ARMADO True. 

BOY Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here is “three” studied ere you’ll thrice wink. And how easy it is to put “years” to the word “three” and study “three years” in two words, the dancing horse will tell you. 

ARMADO  A most fine figure.	 

BOY ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> To prove you a cipher. 

ARMADO I will hereupon confess I am in love; and as it is base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a base wench. If drawing my sword against the humor of affection would deliver me from the	 reprobate thought of it, I would take desire prisoner and ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised curtsy. I think scorn to sigh; methinks I should outswear Cupid. Comfort me, boy. What great men have been in love?	 

BOY Hercules, master. 

ARMADO Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good repute and carriage. 

BOY Samson, master; he was a man of good carriage,	 great carriage, for he carried the town gates on his back like a porter, and he was in love. 

ARMADO O, well-knit Samson, strong-jointed Samson; I do excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was	 Samson’s love, my dear Mote? 

BOY A woman, master. 

ARMADO Of what complexion? 

BOY Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.	 

ARMADO Tell me precisely of what complexion. 

BOY  Of the sea-water green, sir. 

ARMADO Is that one of the four complexions? 

BOY As I have read, sir, and the best of them too. 

ARMADO Green indeed is the color of lovers. But to	 have a love of that color, methinks Samson had small reason for it. He surely affected her for her wit. 

BOY It was so, sir, for she had a green wit. 

ARMADO My love is most immaculate white and red. 

BOY Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under such colors. 

ARMADO  Define, define, well-educated infant. 

BOY My father’s wit and my mother’s tongue, assist me.		 

ARMADO Sweet invocation of a child, most pretty and pathetical. 

BOY If she be made of white and red, Her faults will ne’er be known, For blushing cheeks by faults are bred,	 And fears by pale white shown. Then if she fear, or be to blame, By this you shall not know, For still her cheeks possess the same Which native she doth owe.	 A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red. 

ARMADO Is there not a ballad, boy, of “The King and the Beggar”? 

BOY The world was very guilty of such a ballad some	 three ages since, but I think now ’tis not to be found; or if it were, it would neither serve for the writing nor the tune. 

ARMADO I will have that subject newly writ o’er, that I may example my digression by some mighty precedent.	 Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the park with the rational hind Costard. She deserves well. 

BOY ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> To be whipped—and yet a better love than my master.	 

ARMADO Sing, boy. My spirit grows heavy in love. 

BOY ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> And that’s great marvel, loving a light wench. 

ARMADO  I say sing. 

BOY Forbear till this company be past.	 

<ACTION>Enter Clown (Costard,) Constable (Dull,) and Wench(Jaquenetta.)</ACTION> 

DULL ,  <ACTION>to Armado</ACTION> Sir, the Duke’s pleasure is that you keep Costard safe, and you must suffer him to take no delight, nor no penance, but he must fast three days a week. For this damsel, I must keep her at the park. She is allowed for the dey-woman. Fare you	 well. 

ARMADO ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> I do betray myself with blushing.— Maid. 

JAQUENETTA Man. 

ARMADO I will visit thee at the lodge.	 

JAQUENETTA  That’s hereby. 

ARMADO  I know where it is situate. 

JAQUENETTA Lord, how wise you are. 

ARMADO I will tell thee wonders. 

JAQUENETTA With that face?	 

ARMADO I love thee. 

JAQUENETTA  So I heard you say. 

ARMADO And so, farewell. 

JAQUENETTA  Fair weather after you. 

DULL  Come, Jaquenetta, away.	 

<ACTION>Dull and Jaquenetta exit.</ACTION> 

ARMADO ,  <ACTION>to Costard</ACTION> Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offenses ere thou be pardoned. 

COSTARD  Well, sir, I hope when I do it I shall do it on a full stomach. 

ARMADO  Thou shalt be heavily punished.	 

COSTARD I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they are but lightly rewarded. 

ARMADO ,  <ACTION>to Boy</ACTION> Take away this villain. Shut him up. 

BOY  Come, you transgressing slave, away. 

COSTARD ,  <ACTION>to Armado</ACTION> Let me not be pent up, sir. I will	 fast being loose. 

BOY No, sir, that were fast and loose. Thou shalt to prison. 

COSTARD  Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation that I have seen, some shall see.	 

BOY What shall some see? 

COSTARD Nay, nothing, Master Mote, but what they look upon. It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their words, and therefore I will say nothing. I thank God I have as little patience as another man, and	 therefore I can be quiet. 

<ACTION>Costard and Boy exit.</ACTION> 

ARMADO I do affect the very ground (which is base) where her shoe (which is baser) guided by her foot (which is basest) doth tread. I shall be forsworn (which is a great argument of falsehood) if I love.	 And how can that be true love which is falsely attempted? Love is a familiar; love is a devil. There is no evil angel but love, yet was Samson so tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit. Cupid’s	 butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules’ club, and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard’s rapier. The first and second cause will not serve my turn; the passado he respects not, the duello he regards not. His disgrace is to be called “boy,” but his glory is to	 subdue men. Adieu, valor; rust, rapier; be still, drum, for your manager is in love. Yea, he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme, for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise wit, write pen, for I am for whole volumes in folio.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
