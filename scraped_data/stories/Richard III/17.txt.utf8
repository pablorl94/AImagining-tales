TYRREL The tyrannous and bloody act is done, The most arch deed of piteous massacre That ever yet this land was guilty of. Dighton and Forrest, who I did suborn To do this piece of ruthless butchery, Albeit they were fleshed villains, bloody dogs, Melted with tenderness and mild compassion, Wept like two children in their deaths’ sad story. “O thus,” quoth Dighton, “lay the gentle babes.” “Thus, thus,” quoth Forrest, “girdling one another	 Within their alabaster innocent arms. Their lips were four red roses on a stalk, And in their summer beauty kissed each other. A book of prayers on their pillow lay, Which once,” quoth Forrest, “almost changed my	 mind, But, O, the devil—” There the villain stopped; When Dighton thus told on: “We smotherèd The most replenishèd sweet work of nature That from the prime creation e’er she framed.”	 Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse; They could not speak; and so I left them both To bear this tidings to the bloody king. 

<ACTION>Enter Richard.</ACTION> 

And here he comes.—All health, my sovereign lord. 

RICHARD Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?	 

TYRREL If to have done the thing you gave in charge Beget your happiness, be happy then, For it is done. 

RICHARD But did’st thou see them dead? 

TYRREL I did, my lord.	 

RICHARD  And buried, gentle Tyrrel? 

TYRREL The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them, But where, to say the truth, I do not know. 

RICHARD Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after-supper, When thou shalt tell the process of their death. Meantime, but think how I may do thee good, And be inheritor of thy desire. Farewell till then. 

TYRREL I humbly take my leave. 

<ACTION>Tyrrel exits.</ACTION> 

RICHARD The son of Clarence have I pent up close,	 His daughter meanly have I matched in marriage, The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham’s bosom, And Anne my wife hath bid this world goodnight. Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims At young Elizabeth, my brother’s daughter, And by that knot looks proudly on the crown, To her go I, a jolly thriving wooer. 

<ACTION>Enter Ratcliffe.</ACTION> 

RATCLIFFE My lord. 

RICHARD Good or bad news, that thou com’st in so bluntly? 

RATCLIFFE Bad news, my lord. Morton is fled to Richmond,	 And Buckingham, backed with the hardy Welshmen, Is in the field, and still his power increaseth. 

RICHARD Ely with Richmond troubles me more near Than Buckingham and his rash-levied strength. Come, I have learned that fearful commenting Is leaden servitor to dull delay; Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary; Then fiery expedition be my wing, Jove’s Mercury, and herald for a king. Go, muster men. My counsel is my shield.	 We must be brief when traitors brave the field.
