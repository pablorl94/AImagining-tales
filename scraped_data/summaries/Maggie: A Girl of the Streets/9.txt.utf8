Jimmie starts to get a little irked about Pete coming by and compromising his sister's reputation.

A neighbor provokes Jimmie even more by reporting that she overheard Maggie basically begging Pete to love her. This can only mean one thing: Maggie has not acted so ladylike. He reports to his mom that Maggie has "gone teh deh devil" (10.17). So much for sibling loyalty, we guess…

Mary is thoroughly perplexed about how Maggie could have become such a bad girl after being raised in such a decent and morally upstanding household. Why? Why? Why?

It doesn't help that Mary curses her daughter, but Jimmie's off to take care of business in the form of—you guessed it—a brawl. Bring it on.
