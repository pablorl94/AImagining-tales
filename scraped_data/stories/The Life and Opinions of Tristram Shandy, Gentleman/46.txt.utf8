Chapter 1.XLVII. 

It was not an easy matter in any king's reign (unless you were as lean a subject as myself) to have forced your hand diagonally, quite across your whole body, so as to gain the bottom of your opposite coat pocket.--In the year one thousand seven hundred and eighteen, when this happened, it was extremely difficult; so that when my uncle Toby discovered the transverse zig-zaggery of my father's approaches towards it, it instantly brought into his mind those he had done duty in, before the gate of St. Nicolas;--the idea of which drew off his attention so intirely from the subject in debate, that he had got his right hand to the bell to ring up Trim to go and fetch his map of Namur, and his compasses and sector along with it, to measure the returning angles of the traverses of that attack,--but particularly of that one, where he received his wound upon his groin. 

My father knit his brows, and as he knit them, all the blood in his body seemed to rush up into his face--my uncle Toby dismounted immediately. 

--I did not apprehend your uncle Toby was o'horseback.--
