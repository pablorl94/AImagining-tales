<ACTION>Enter Leonato, meeting an old man, brother toLeonato.</ACTION> 

LEONATO How now, brother, where is my cousin, your son? Hath he provided this music? 

LEONATO’S BROTHER He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.	 

LEONATO Are they good? 

LEONATO’S BROTHER As the events stamps them, but they have a good cover; they show well outward. The Prince and Count Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine orchard, were thus much	 overheard by a man of mine: the Prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance, and if he found her accordant, he meant to take the present time by the top and instantly break with you	 of it. 

LEONATO Hath the fellow any wit that told you this? 

LEONATO’S BROTHER A good sharp fellow. I will send for him, and question him yourself. 

LEONATO No, no, we will hold it as a dream till it	 appear itself. But I will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better prepared for an answer, if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it. 

<ACTION>Enter Antonio’s son, with a Musician and Attendants.</ACTION> 

Cousins, you know what you have to do.—O, I cry	 you mercy, friend. Go you with me and I will use your skill.—Good cousin, have a care this busy time. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
