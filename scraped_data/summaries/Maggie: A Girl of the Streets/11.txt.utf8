Some time has passed, and we find Pete and Maggie in an "irregular shaped" hall. The vibe of the venue has changed, and the classy factor seems to have nosedived. The seduction is over.

Maggie still worships Pete as a valiant hero, while his interest seems to have waned some. She is reconciled with her decision to leave home and become sort of... unmarriageable, shall we say.

What with his dapper dress and valiant ways, Pete rescued her from "her former Rum Alley environment" (12.10) and the "cursed jays," a.k.a. Maggie's mother and brother.
