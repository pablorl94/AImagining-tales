<ACTION>Enter Countess of Auvergne, with Porter.</ACTION> 

COUNTESS Porter, remember what I gave in charge, And when you have done so, bring the keys to me. 

PORTER Madam, I will.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

COUNTESS The plot is laid. If all things fall out right, I shall as famous be by this exploit	 As Scythian Tamyris by Cyrus’ death. Great is the rumor of this dreadful knight, And his achievements of no less account. Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears To give their censure of these rare reports.	 

<ACTION>Enter Messenger and Talbot.</ACTION> 

MESSENGER Madam, according as your Ladyship desired, By message craved, so is Lord Talbot come. 

COUNTESS And he is welcome. What, is this the man? 

MESSENGER Madam, it is. 

COUNTESS Is this the scourge of France?	 Is this the Talbot, so much feared abroad That with his name the mothers still their babes? I see report is fabulous and false. I thought I should have seen some Hercules, A second Hector, for his grim aspect	 And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs. Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf! It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp Should strike such terror to his enemies. 

TALBOT Madam, I have been bold to trouble you.	 But since your Ladyship is not at leisure, I’ll sort some other time to visit you. <ACTION>He begins to exit.</ACTION> 

COUNTESS ,  <ACTION>to Messenger</ACTION> What means he now? Go ask him whither he goes. 

MESSENGER Stay, my Lord Talbot, for my lady craves To know the cause of your abrupt departure.	 

TALBOT Marry, for that she’s in a wrong belief, I go to certify her Talbot’s here. 

<ACTION>Enter Porter with keys.</ACTION> 

COUNTESS , <ACTION> to Talbot</ACTION> If thou be he, then art thou prisoner. 

TALBOT Prisoner? To whom? 

COUNTESS To me, bloodthirsty lord.	 And for that cause I trained thee to my house. Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me, For in my gallery thy picture hangs. But now the substance shall endure the like, And I will chain these legs and arms of thine,	 That hast by tyranny these many years Wasted our country, slain our citizens, And sent our sons and husbands captivate. 

TALBOT  Ha, ha, ha! 

COUNTESS Laughest thou, wretch? Thy mirth shall turn to moan.	 

TALBOT I laugh to see your Ladyship so fond To think that you have aught but Talbot’s shadow Whereon to practice your severity. 

COUNTESS Why, art not thou the man? 

TALBOT I am, indeed.	 

COUNTESS Then have I substance too. 

TALBOT No, no, I am but shadow of myself. You are deceived; my substance is not here, For what you see is but the smallest part And least proportion of humanity.	 I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here, It is of such a spacious lofty pitch Your roof were not sufficient to contain ’t. 

COUNTESS This is a riddling merchant for the nonce: He will be here and yet he is not here. How can these contrarieties agree? 

TALBOT That will I show you presently. 

<ACTION>Winds his horn. Drums strike up;a peal of ordnance.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Soldiers.</ACTION> 

How say you, madam? Are you now persuaded That Talbot is but shadow of himself? These are his substance, sinews, arms, and strength,	 With which he yoketh your rebellious necks, Razeth your cities, and subverts your towns, And in a moment makes them desolate. 

COUNTESS Victorious Talbot, pardon my abuse. I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited,	 And more than may be gathered by thy shape. Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath, For I am sorry that with reverence I did not entertain thee as thou art. 

TALBOT Be not dismayed, fair lady, nor misconster	 The mind of Talbot as you did mistake The outward composition of his body. What you have done hath not offended me, Nor other satisfaction do I crave But only, with your patience, that we may	 Taste of your wine and see what cates you have, For soldiers’ stomachs always serve them well. 

COUNTESS With all my heart, and think me honorèd To feast so great a warrior in my house. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
