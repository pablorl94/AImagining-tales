Mary gets kicked out of the local saloon, an event she does not take well. The local collection of street urchins finds amusement in her anger, taunting and laughing, but it's not pretty to anyone else.

Not one for subtlety, Mary kicks in the door of the apartment, where Jimmie greets her. A tussle ensues.

Pete arrives just in time to witness the violent family episode. Mary takes the opportunity to humiliate Maggie, accusing her of all sorts of shameful behavior, calling her a "disgrace," and in not so many words, telling her she is a worthless, shall we say, lady of the night.

Pete and Maggie beat a hasty retreat.
