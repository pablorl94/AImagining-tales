<ACTION>A loud alarum. Enter Clifford,wearing the red rose, wounded.</ACTION> 

CLIFFORD Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies, Which whiles it lasted gave King Henry light. O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow More than my body’s parting with my soul! My love and fear glued many friends to thee; And now I fall, thy tough commixtures melts, Impairing Henry, strength’ning misproud York; And whither fly the gnats but to the sun? And who shines now but Henry’s enemies? O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent	 That Phaëton should check thy fiery steeds, Thy burning car never had scorched the Earth! And Henry, hadst thou swayed as kings should do, Or as thy father and his father did, Giving no ground unto the house of York,	 They never then had sprung like summer flies; I and ten thousand in this luckless realm Had left no mourning widows for our death, And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace. For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air? And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity? Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds; No way to fly, no strength to hold out flight. The foe is merciless and will not pity, For at their hands I have deserved no pity. 

The air hath got into my deadly wounds, And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest. I stabbed your fathers’ bosoms; split my breast. 

<ACTION>He faints.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Alarum and retreat. Enter Edward, Warwick,Richard, and Soldiers, Montague, and George,all wearing the white rose.</ACTION> 

EDWARD Now breathe we, lords. Good fortune bids us pause	 And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks. Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen That led calm Henry, though he were a king, As doth a sail filled with a fretting gust Command an argosy to stem the waves <ACTION>.	</ACTION> But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them? 

WARWICK No, ’tis impossible he should escape, For, though before his face I speak the words, Your brother Richard marked him for the grave, And wheresoe’er he is, he’s surely dead <ACTION>.	</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Clifford groans, and dies.</ACTION> 

RICHARD Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave? A deadly groan, like life and death’s departing. 

EDWARD See who it is; and, now the battle’s ended, If friend or foe, let him be gently used. 

RICHARD Revoke that doom of mercy, for ’tis Clifford,	 Who not contented that he lopped the branch In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth, But set his murd’ring knife unto the root From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring, I mean our princely father, Duke of York. 

WARWICK From off the gates of York fetch down the head, Your father’s head, which Clifford placèd there; Instead whereof let this supply the room. Measure for measure must be answerèd. 

EDWARD Bring forth that fatal screech owl to our house	 That nothing sung but death to us and ours; Now death shall stop his dismal threat’ning sound, And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak. 

WARWICK I think his understanding is bereft.— Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to	 thee?— Dark cloudy death o’ershades his beams of life, And he nor sees nor hears us what we say. 

RICHARD O, would he did—and so, perhaps, he doth! ’Tis but his policy to counterfeit, Because he would avoid such bitter taunts Which in the time of death he gave our father. 

GEORGE If so thou think’st, vex him with eager words. 

RICHARD Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace. 

EDWARD Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.	 

WARWICK Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults. 

GEORGE While we devise fell tortures for thy faults. 

RICHARD Thou didst love York, and I am son to York. 

EDWARD Thou pitied’st Rutland; I will pity thee. 

GEORGE Where’s Captain Margaret to fence you now?	 

WARWICK They mock thee, Clifford; swear as thou wast wont. 

RICHARD What, not an oath? Nay, then, the world goes hard When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath. I know by that he’s dead; and, by my soul, If this right hand would buy but two hours’ life	 That I in all despite might rail at him, This hand should chop it off, and with the issuing blood Stifle the villain whose unstaunchèd thirst York and young Rutland could not satisfy.	 

WARWICK Ay, but he’s dead. Off with the traitor’s head, And rear it in the place your father’s stands. And now to London with triumphant march, There to be crownèd England’s royal king, From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France	 And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen; So shalt thou sinew both these lands together, And having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread The scattered foe that hopes to rise again; For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,	 Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears. First will I see the coronation, And then to Brittany I’ll cross the sea To effect this marriage, so it please my lord. 

EDWARD Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;	 For in thy shoulder do I build my seat, And never will I undertake the thing Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.— Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester, And George, of Clarence. Warwick as ourself	 Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best. 

RICHARD Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester, For Gloucester’s dukedom is too ominous. 

WARWICK Tut, that’s a foolish observation. Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London, To see these honors in possession. 

<ACTION>They exit, with Clifford’s body.</ACTION>
