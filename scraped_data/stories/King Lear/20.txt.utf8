<ACTION>Enter Regan and Oswald, the Steward.</ACTION> 

REGAN But are my brother’s powers set forth? 

OSWALD Ay, madam. 

REGAN Himself in person there? 

OSWALD Madam, with much ado. Your sister is the better soldier.	 

REGAN Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home? 

OSWALD No, madam. 

REGAN What might import my sister’s letter to him? 

OSWALD I know not, lady. 

REGAN Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.	 It was great ignorance, Gloucester’s eyes being out, To let him live. Where he arrives he moves All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone, In pity of his misery, to dispatch His nighted life; moreover to descry	 The strength o’ th’ enemy. 

OSWALD I must needs after him, madam, with my letter. 

REGAN Our troops set forth tomorrow. Stay with us. The ways are dangerous. 

OSWALD I may not, madam.	 My lady charged my duty in this business. 

REGAN Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you Transport her purposes by word? Belike, Some things—I know not what. I’ll love thee much— Let me unseal the letter.	 

OSWALD Madam, I had rather— 

REGAN I know your lady does not love her husband; I am sure of that; and at her late being here, She gave strange eliads and most speaking looks To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.	 

OSWALD I, madam? 

REGAN I speak in understanding. Y’ are; I know ’t. Therefore I do advise you take this note: My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talked, And more convenient is he for my hand	 Than for your lady’s. You may gather more. If you do find him, pray you, give him this, And when your mistress hears thus much from you, I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her. So, fare you well.	 If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor, Preferment falls on him that cuts him off. 

OSWALD Would I could meet him, madam. I should show What party I do follow. 

REGAN Fare thee well.
