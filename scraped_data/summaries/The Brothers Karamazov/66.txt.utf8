Ilyusha's room is crowded with kids, along with the rest of his family. Captain Snegiryov has accepted Katerina's charity, and she has even paid for a famous doctor to come in to diagnose Ilyusha that day. Alyosha is also present.

When Kolya comes in, Ilyusha is thrilled. He's petting a mastiff puppy that his father brought him, but he's still in mourning over Zhuchka. Kolya tells Ilyusha that he's brought him an even better dog.

But when the dog, Perezvon, finally enters, Ilyusha instantly recognizes it as the ever-suffering Zhuchka.

It seems that over the past several weeks, Kolya has found Zhuchka and trained it all kinds of tricks.

Thrilled by Ilyusha's reaction, Kolya brings out his toy cannon again but hands it over to Ilyusha's mother to play with at Ilyusha's request.

Kolya entertains Ilyusha with the story of his recent brush with the law. Walking through the square, he had tricked a peasant into rolling over a goose with a cart. He was taken to court but got off with just a stern lecture.

Another child, Kartashov, tries to show up Kolya on his knowledge of history – specifically the founders of Troy – but Kolya is able to silence the child with a few clever questions.

The antics are drawn to a close, however, when the famous doctor makes his appearance in the room. Everybody else clears out.
