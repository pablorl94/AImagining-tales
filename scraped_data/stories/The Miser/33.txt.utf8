SCENE III.--HARPAGON, CLÃ‰ANTE. 

HAR. Well, now, all consideration of stepmother aside, tell me what do you think of this lady? 

CLE. What I think of her? 

HAR. Yes, what do you think of her appearance, her figure, her beauty and intelligence? 

CLE. So, so. 

HAR. But still? 

CLE. To tell you the truth, I did not find her such as I expected. Her manner is that of a thorough coquette, her figure is rather awkward, her beauty very middling, and her intelligence of the meanest order. Do not suppose that I say this to make you dislike her; for if I must have a stepmother, I like the idea of this one as well as of any other. 

HAR. You spoke to her just now, nevertheless.... 

CLE. I paid her several compliments in your name, but it was to please you. 

HAR. So then you don't care for her? 

CLE. Who? I? Not in the least. 

HAR. I am sorry for it, for that puts an end to a scheme which had occurred to me. Since I have seen her here, I have been thinking of my own age; and I feel that people would find fault with me for marrying so young a girl. This consideration had made me determine to abandon the project, and as I had demanded her in marriage, and had given her my promise, I would have given her to you if it were not for the dislike you have for her. 

CLE. To me? 

HAR. To you. 

CLE. In marriage? 

HAR. In marriage. 

CLE. It is true she is not at all to my taste; but, to please you, father, I will bring myself to marry her, if you please. 

HAR. If I please! I am more reasonable than you think. I don't wish to compel you. 

CLE. Excuse me! I will make an attempt to love her. 

HAR. No, no; a marriage cannot be happy where there is no love. 

CLE. That, my father, will, perhaps, come by and by, and it is said that love is often the fruit of marriage. 

HAR. No, it is not right to risk it on the side of the man, and there are some troublesome things I don't care to run the chance of. If you had felt any inclination for her, you should have married her instead of me, but as it is, I will return to my first intention and marry her myself. 

CLE. Well, father, since things are so, I had better be frank with you, and reveal our secret to you. The truth is that I have loved her ever since I saw her one day on the promenade. I intended to ask you today to let me marry her, and I was only deterred from it because you spoke of marrying her, and because I feared to displease you. 

HAR. Have you ever paid her any visits? 

CLE. Yes, father. 

HAR. Many? 

CLE. Yes; considering how long we have been acquainted. 

HAR. You were well received. 

CLE. Very well, but without her knowing who I was; and that is why Marianne was so surprised when she saw me today. 

HAR. Have you told her of your love, and of your intention of marrying her? 

CLE. Certainly, and I also spoke a little to the mother on the subject. 

HAR. Did she kindly receive your proposal for her daughter? 

CLE. Yes, very kindly. 

HAR. And does the daughter return your love? 

CLE. If I can believe appearances, she is certainly well disposed towards me. 

HAR. (_aside_). Well! I am very glad to have found out this secret; it is the very thing I wanted to know. (_To his son_) Now, look here, my son, I tell you what. You will have, if you please, to get rid of your love for Marianne, to cease to pay your attentions to a person I intend for myself, and to marry very soon the wife I have chosen for you. 

CLE. So, father, it is thus you deceive me! Very well, since things are come to such a pass, I openly declare to you that I shall not give up my love for Marianne. No! understand that henceforth there is nothing from which I shall shrink in order to dispute her with you; and if you have on your side the consent of the mother, perhaps I shall have some other resources left to aid me. 

HAR. What, rascal! You dare to trespass on my grounds? 

CLE. It is you who trespass on mine. I was the first. 

HAR. Am I not your father, and do you not owe me respect? 

CLE. There are things in which children are not called upon to pay deference to their fathers; and love is no respector of persons. 

HAR. My stick will make you know me better. 

CLE. All your threatenings are nothing to me. 

HAR. You will give up Marianne? 

CLE. Never! 

HAR. Bring me my stick. Quick, I say! my stick!
