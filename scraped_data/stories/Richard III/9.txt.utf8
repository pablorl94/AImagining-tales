<ACTION>Enter a Messenger to the door of Hastings.</ACTION> 

MESSENGER ,  <ACTION>knocking</ACTION> My lord, my lord. 

HASTINGS ,  <ACTION>within  </ACTION> Who knocks? 

MESSENGER One from the Lord Stanley. 

HASTINGS ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> What is ’t o’clock? 

MESSENGER   Upon the stroke of four.	 

<ACTION>Enter Lord Hastings.</ACTION> 

HASTINGS Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights? 

MESSENGER So it appears by that I have to say. First, he commends him to your noble self. 

HASTINGS   What then? 

MESSENGER Then certifies your Lordship that this night	 He dreamt the boar had razèd off his helm. Besides, he says there are two councils kept, And that may be determined at the one Which may make you and him to rue at th’ other. Therefore he sends to know your Lordship’s	 pleasure, If you will presently take horse with him And with all speed post with him toward the north To shun the danger that his soul divines. 

HASTINGS Go, fellow, go. Return unto thy lord <ACTION>.	</ACTION> Bid him not fear the separated council. His Honor and myself are at the one, And at the other is my good friend Catesby, Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us Whereof I shall not have intelligence.	 Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance. And for his dreams, I wonder he’s so simple To trust the mock’ry of unquiet slumbers. To fly the boar before the boar pursues Were to incense the boar to follow us	 And make pursuit where he did mean no chase. Go, bid thy master rise and come to me, And we will both together to the Tower, Where he shall see the boar will use us kindly. 

MESSENGER I’ll go, my lord, and tell him what you say.	 <ACTION>He exits.  </ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Catesby.</ACTION> 

CATESBY Many good morrows to my noble lord. 

HASTINGS Good morrow, Catesby. You are early stirring. What news, what news in this our tott’ring state? 

CATESBY It is a reeling world indeed, my lord, And I believe will never stand upright	 Till Richard wear the garland of the realm. 

HASTINGS How “wear the garland”? Dost thou mean the crown? 

CATESBY   Ay, my good lord. 

HASTINGS I’ll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders Before I’ll see the crown so foul misplaced. But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it? 

CATESBY Ay, on my life, and hopes to find you forward Upon his party for the gain thereof; And thereupon he sends you this good news,	 That this same very day your enemies, The kindred of the Queen, must die at Pomfret. 

HASTINGS Indeed, I am no mourner for that news, Because they have been still my adversaries. But that I’ll give my voice on Richard’s side To bar my master’s heirs in true descent, God knows I will not do it, to the death. 

CATESBY God keep your Lordship in that gracious mind. 

HASTINGS But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence, That they which brought me in my master’s hate,	 I live to look upon their tragedy. Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older I’ll send some packing that yet think not on ’t. 

CATESBY ’Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord, When men are unprepared and look not for it.	 

HASTINGS O monstrous, monstrous! And so falls it out With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey; and so ’twill do With some men else that think themselves as safe As thou and I, who, as thou know’st, are dear To princely Richard and to Buckingham.	 

CATESBY The Princes both make high account of you— <ACTION>Aside.</ACTION> For they account his head upon the Bridge. 

HASTINGS I know they do, and I have well deserved it. 

<ACTION>Enter Lord Stanley.</ACTION> 

Come on, come on. Where is your boar-spear, man? Fear you the boar and go so unprovided?	 

STANLEY My lord, good morrow.—Good morrow, Catesby.— You may jest on, but, by the Holy Rood, I do not like these several councils, I. 

HASTINGS My lord, I hold my life as dear as you do yours, And never in my days, I do protest, Was it so precious to me as ’tis now. Think you but that I know our state secure, I would be so triumphant as I am? 

STANLEY The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London, Were jocund and supposed their states were sure,	 And they indeed had no cause to mistrust; But yet you see how soon the day o’ercast. This sudden stab of rancor I misdoubt. Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward! What, shall we toward the Tower? The day is spent.	 

HASTINGS Come, come. Have with you. Wot you what, my lord? Today the lords you talked of are beheaded. 

STANLEY They, for their truth, might better wear their heads Than some that have accused them wear their hats. But come, my lord, let’s away.	 

<ACTION>Enter a Pursuivant.</ACTION> 

HASTINGS Go on before. I’ll talk with this good fellow. 

<ACTION>Lord Stanley and Catesby exit.</ACTION> 

How now, sirrah? How goes the world with thee? 

PURSUIVANT The better that your Lordship please to ask. 

HASTINGS I tell thee, man, ’tis better with me now Than when thou met’st me last where now we meet.	 Then was I going prisoner to the Tower By the suggestion of the Queen’s allies. But now, I tell thee—keep it to thyself— This day those enemies are put to death, And I in better state than e’er I was.	 

PURSUIVANT God hold it, to your Honor’s good content! 

HASTINGS Gramercy, fellow. There, drink that for me. 

<ACTION>Throws him his purse.</ACTION> 

PURSUIVANT I thank your Honor. <ACTION>	Pursuivant exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter a Priest.</ACTION> 

PRIEST Well met, my lord. I am glad to see your Honor. 

HASTINGS I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.	 I am in your debt for your last exercise. Come the next sabbath, and I will content you. 

PRIEST I’ll wait upon your Lordship.	 <ACTION>Priest exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Buckingham.</ACTION> 

BUCKINGHAM What, talking with a priest, Lord Chamberlain? Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest; Your Honor hath no shriving work in hand. 

HASTINGS Good faith, and when I met this holy man, The men you talk of came into my mind. What, go you toward the Tower? 

BUCKINGHAM I do, my lord, but long I cannot stay there.	 I shall return before your Lordship thence. 

HASTINGS Nay, like enough, for I stay dinner there. 

BUCKINGHAM ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> And supper too, although thou know’st it not.— Come, will you go? 

HASTINGS I’ll wait upon your Lordship.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
