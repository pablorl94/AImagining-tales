<ACTION>Enter Coriolanus in mean apparel, disguised,and muffled.</ACTION> 

CORIOLANUS A goodly city is this Antium. City, ’Tis I that made thy widows. Many an heir Of these fair edifices ’fore my wars Have I heard groan and drop. Then, know me not, Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones	 In puny battle slay me. 

<ACTION>Enter a Citizen.</ACTION> 

Save you, sir. 

CITIZEN And you. 

CORIOLANUS Direct me, if it be your will, Where great Aufidius lies. Is he in Antium?	 

CITIZEN He is, and feasts the nobles of the state At his house this night. 

CORIOLANUS Which is his house, beseech you? 

CITIZEN This here before you.	 

CORIOLANUS Thank you, sir. Farewell. Citizen exits. 

O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn, Whose double bosoms seems to wear one heart, Whose hours, whose bed, whose meal and exercise Are still together, who twin, as ’twere, in love	 Unseparable, shall within this hour, On a dissension of a doit, break out To bitterest enmity; so fellest foes, Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep	 To take the one the other, by some chance, Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends And interjoin their issues. So with me: My birthplace hate I, and my love’s upon This enemy town. I’ll enter. If he slay me,	 He does fair justice; if he give me way, I’ll do his country service. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
