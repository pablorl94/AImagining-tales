<ACTION>Enter Robin followed by Mistress Page.</ACTION> 

MISTRESS PAGE Nay, keep your way, little gallant. You were wont to be a follower, but now you are a leader. Whether had you rather—lead mine eyes, or eye your master’s heels? 

ROBIN  I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man	 than follow him like a dwarf. 

MISTRESS PAGE O, you are a flattering boy! Now I see you’ll be a courtier. 

<ACTION>Enter Ford.</ACTION> 

FORD  Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you? 

MISTRESS PAGE Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at	 home? 

FORD Ay, and as idle as she may hang together, for want of company. I think if your husbands were dead, you two would marry. 

MISTRESS PAGE Be sure of that—two other husbands.	 

FORD Where had you this pretty weathercock? 

MISTRESS PAGE I cannot tell what the dickens his name is my husband had him of.—What do you call your knight’s name, sirrah? 

ROBIN Sir John Falstaff.	 

FORD Sir John Falstaff! 

MISTRESS PAGE He, he. I can never hit on ’s name. There is such a league between my goodman and he. Is your wife at home indeed? 

FORD  Indeed, she is.	 

MISTRESS PAGE By your leave, sir. I am sick till I see her.	 

<ACTION>Mistress Page and Robin exit.</ACTION> 

FORD Has Page any brains? Hath he any eyes? Hath he any thinking? Sure they sleep; he hath no use of them. Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty	 mile as easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve score. He pieces out his wife’s inclination. He gives her folly motion and advantage. And now she’s going to my wife, and Falstaff’s boy with her. A man may hear this shower sing in the wind. And	 Falstaff’s boy with her! Good plots they are laid, and our revolted wives share damnation together. Well, I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck the borrowed veil of modesty from the so-seeming Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure	 and willful Acteon, and to these violent proceedings all my neighbors shall cry aim. A clock strikes. The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me search. There I shall find Falstaff. I shall be rather praised for this than mocked, for it	 is as positive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is there. I will go. 

<ACTION>Enter Page, Shallow, Slender, Host, Sir HughEvans, Doctor Caius, and Rugby.</ACTION> 

SHALLOW, PAGE, ETC. Well met, Master Ford. 

FORD  Trust me, a good knot. I have good cheer at home, and I pray you all go with me.	 

SHALLOW I must excuse myself, Master Ford. 

SLENDER  And so must I, sir. We have appointed to dine with Mistress Anne, and I would not break with her for more money than I’ll speak of. 

SHALLOW  We have lingered about a match between	 Anne Page and my cousin Slender, and this day we shall have our answer. 

SLENDER I hope I have your good will, Father Page. 

PAGE You have, Master Slender. I stand wholly for you.—But my wife, Master Doctor, is for you	 altogether. 

DOCTOR CAIUS  Ay, be-gar, and de maid is love-a me! My nursh-a Quickly tell me so mush. 

HOST ,  <ACTION>to Page </ACTION> What say you to young Master Fenton? He capers, he dances, he has eyes of youth, he	 writes verses, he speaks holiday, he smells April and May. He will carry ’t, he will carry ’t. ’Tis in his buttons he will carry ’t. 

PAGE  Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is of no having. He kept company with the	 wild Prince and Poins. He is of too high a region; he knows too much. No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes with the finger of my substance. If he take her, let him take her simply. The wealth I have waits on my consent, and my consent goes not that	 way. 

FORD I beseech you heartily, some of you go home with me to dinner. Besides your cheer, you shall have sport: I will show you a monster. Master Doctor, you shall go.—So shall you, Master Page.—	 And you, Sir Hugh. 

SHALLOW Well, fare you well. We shall have the freer wooing at Master Page’s. 

<ACTION>Shallow and Slender exit.</ACTION> 

DOCTOR CAIUS  Go home, John Rugby. I come anon. 

<ACTION>Rugby exits.</ACTION> 

HOST Farewell, my hearts. I will to my honest knight	 Falstaff, and drink canary with him.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

FORD , <ACTION> aside</ACTION> I think I shall drink in pipe-wine first with him; I’ll make him dance.—Will you go, gentles? 

PAGE, DOCTOR CAIUS, AND SIR HUGH  Have with you to	 see this monster. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
