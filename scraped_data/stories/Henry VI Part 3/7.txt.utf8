<ACTION>Excursions. Enter, at separate doors, Richard wearingthe white rose, and Clifford, wearing the red rose.</ACTION> 

RICHARD Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone. Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York, And this for Rutland, both bound to revenge, Wert thou environed with a brazen wall. 

CLIFFORD Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone. This is the hand that stabbed thy father York, And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland, And hereâ€™s the heart that triumphs in their death And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother To execute the like upon thyself.	 And so, have at thee! 

<ACTION>They fight; Warwick comes; Clifford flies.</ACTION> 

RICHARD Nay, Warwick, single out some other chase, For I myself will hunt this wolf to death. <ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
