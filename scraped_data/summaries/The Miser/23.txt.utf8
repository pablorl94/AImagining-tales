With Master Jacques gone, Mariane tells Frosine how she doesn't want to marry Harpagon. Not only is Master Jacques a moldy oldie, but also Mariane is in love with a young man and wants to marry him. Hmm, could the young man in question be Cl√©ante?

Frosine guarantees Mariane that she won't be married to Harpagon a year before he kicks the bucket. And once he's dead, Mariane will inherit all his money.

As Harpagon comes onstage, Mariane cries out at how terrible his face is. Yowch. That's rude.
