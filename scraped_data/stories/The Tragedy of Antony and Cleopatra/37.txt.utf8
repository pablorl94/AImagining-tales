<ACTION>Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, and Mardian.</ACTION> 

CLEOPATRA Help me, my women! O, he’s more mad Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly Was never so embossed. 

CHARMIAN  To th’ monument! There lock yourself and send him word you are	 dead. The soul and body rive not more in parting Than greatness going off. 

CLEOPATRA To th’ monument!— Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself.	 Say that the last I spoke was “Antony,” And word it, prithee, piteously. Hence, Mardian, And bring me how he takes my death.—To th’ monument! 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
