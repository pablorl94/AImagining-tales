<ACTION>Enter Duke and Friar Peter.</ACTION> 

DUKE ,  <ACTION>giving the Friar papers.</ACTION> These letters at fit time deliver me. The Provost knows our purpose and our plot. The matter being afoot, keep your instruction And hold you ever to our special drift, Though sometimes you do blench from this to that As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius’ house And tell him where I stay. Give the like notice To Valencius, Rowland, and to Crassus, And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate. But send me Flavius first.	 

FRIAR PETER It shall be speeded well.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>

DUKE I thank thee, Varrius. Thou hast made good haste. Come, we will walk. There’s other of our friends Will greet us here anon. My gentle Varrius. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
