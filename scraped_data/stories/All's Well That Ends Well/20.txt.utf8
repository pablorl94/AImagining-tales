<ACTION>Enter Helen, Widow, and Diana, with two Attendants.</ACTION> 

HELEN But this exceeding posting day and night Must wear your spirits low. We cannot help it. But since you have made the days and nights as one To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs, Be bold you do so grow in my requital	 As nothing can unroot you. 

<ACTION>Enter a Gentleman, a gentle Astringer.</ACTION> 

In happy time! This man may help me to his Majesty’s ear, If he would spend his power.—God save you, sir. 

GENTLEMAN And you.	 

HELEN Sir, I have seen you in the court of France. 

GENTLEMAN I have been sometimes there. 

HELEN I do presume, sir, that you are not fall’n From the report that goes upon your goodness, And therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions	 Which lay nice manners by, I put you to The use of your own virtues, for the which I shall continue thankful. 

GENTLEMAN  What’s your will? 

HELEN ,  <ACTION>taking out a paper </ACTION> That it will please you   To give this poor petition to the King And aid me with that store of power you have To come into his presence. 

GENTLEMAN The King’s not here. 

HELEN Not here, sir?	 

GENTLEMAN Not indeed. He hence removed last night, and with more haste Than is his use. 

WIDOW Lord, how we lose our pains! 

HELEN  All’s well that ends well yet,	 Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.— I do beseech you, whither is he gone? 

GENTLEMAN Marry, as I take it, to Rossillion, Whither I am going. 

HELEN ,  <ACTION>giving him the paper</ACTION> I do beseech you, sir, 	  Since you are like to see the King before me, Commend the paper to his gracious hand, Which I presume shall render you no blame But rather make you thank your pains for it. I will come after you with what good speed	 Our means will make us means. 

GENTLEMAN This I’ll do for you. 

HELEN And you shall find yourself to be well thanked Whate’er falls more. We must to horse again.— Go, go, provide.
