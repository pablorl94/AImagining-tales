<ACTION>Enter Pistol, Nym, Bardolph, Boy, and Hostess.</ACTION> 

HOSTESS Prithee, honey-sweet husband, let me bring thee to Staines. 

PISTOL No; for my manly heart doth earn.—Bardolph, be blithe.—Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins.— Boy, bristle thy courage up. For Falstaff, he is dead, and	 we must earn therefore. 

BARDOLPH  Would I were with him, wheresome’er he is, either in heaven or in hell. 

HOSTESS   Nay, sure, he’s not in hell! He’s in Arthur’s bosom, if ever man went to Arthur’s bosom. He	 made a finer end, and went away an it had been any christom child. He parted ev’n just between twelve and one, ev’n at the turning o’ th’ tide; for after I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with flowers and smile upon his finger’s end, I knew there was but one way, for his nose was as sharp as a pen and he talked of green fields. “How now, Sir John?” quoth I. “What, man, be o’ good cheer!” So he cried out “God, God, God!” three or four times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him he should not think of God; I	 hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. So he bade me lay more clothes on his feet. I put my hand into the bed and felt them, and they were as cold as any stone. Then I felt to his knees, and so upward and upward, and	 all was as cold as any stone. 

NYM They say he cried out of sack. 

HOSTESS Ay, that he did. 

BARDOLPH  And of women. 

HOSTESS Nay, that he did not.	 

BOY  Yes, that he did, and said they were devils incarnate. 

HOSTESS He could never abide carnation. ’Twas a color he never liked. 

BOY  He said once, the devil would have him about	 women. 

HOSTESS He did in some sort, indeed, handle women, but then he was rheumatic and talked of the Whore of Babylon. 

BOY Do you not remember he saw a flea stick upon	 Bardolph’s nose, and he said it was a black soul burning in hell? 

BARDOLPH  Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that fire. That’s all the riches I got in his service. 

NYM   Shall we shog? The King will be gone from	 Southampton. 

PISTOL  Come, let’s away.—My love, give me thy lips. <ACTION>They kiss.</ACTION> Look to my chattels and my movables. Let senses rule. The word is “Pitch and pay.” Trust none, for oaths are straws, men’s faiths are wafer-cakes,	 and Holdfast is the only dog, my duck. Therefore, Caveto be thy counselor. Go, clear thy crystals.—Yoke-fellows in arms, let us to France, like horse-leeches, my boys, to suck, to suck, the very blood to suck.	 

BOY And that’s but unwholesome food, they say. 

PISTOL   Touch her soft mouth, and march. 

BARDOLPH ,  <ACTION>kissing the Hostess</ACTION> Farewell, hostess. 

NYM I cannot kiss, that is the humor of it. But adieu. 

PISTOL ,  <ACTION>to the Hostess </ACTION> Let huswifery appear. Keep	 close, I thee command. 

HOSTESS Farewell. Adieu. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
