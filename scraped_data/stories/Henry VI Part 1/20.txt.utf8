PUCELLE The Regent conquers and the Frenchmen fly. Now help, you charming spells and periapts, And you choice spirits that admonish me, And give me signs of future accidents.	 

<ACTION>Thunder.</ACTION> 

You speedy helpers, that are substitutes Under the lordly monarch of the north, Appear, and aid me in this enterprise. 

<ACTION>Enter Fiends.</ACTION> 

This speed and quick appearance argues proof Of your accustomed diligence to me. Now, you familiar spirits that are culled	 Out of the powerful regions under earth, Help me this once, that France may get the field. 

<ACTION>They walk, and speak not.</ACTION> 

O, hold me not with silence overlong! Where I was wont to feed you with my blood, I’ll lop a member off and give it you	 In earnest of a further benefit, So you do condescend to help me now. 

<ACTION>They hang their heads.</ACTION> 

No hope to have redress? My body shall Pay recompense if you will grant my suit. 

<ACTION>They shake their heads.</ACTION> 

Cannot my body nor blood-sacrifice	 Entreat you to your wonted furtherance? Then take my soul—my body, soul, and all— Before that England give the French the foil. 

<ACTION>They depart.</ACTION> 

See, they forsake me. Now the time is come That France must vail her lofty-plumèd crest	 And let her head fall into England’s lap. My ancient incantations are too weak, And hell too strong for me to buckle with. Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust.

<ACTION>Excursions. Burgundy and York fight hand to hand.Burgundy and the French fly as York and Englishsoldiers capture Joan la Pucelle.</ACTION> 

YORK Damsel of France, I think I have you fast.	 Unchain your spirits now with spelling charms, And try if they can gain your liberty. A goodly prize, fit for the devil’s grace! See how the ugly witch doth bend her brows As if with Circe she would change my shape.	 

PUCELLE Changed to a worser shape thou canst not be. 

YORK O, Charles the Dauphin is a proper man; No shape but his can please your dainty eye. 

PUCELLE A plaguing mischief light on Charles and thee, And may you both be suddenly surprised	 By bloody hands in sleeping on your beds! 

YORK Fell banning hag! Enchantress, hold thy tongue. 

PUCELLE I prithee give me leave to curse awhile. 

YORK Curse, miscreant, when thou com’st to the stake. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Alarum. Enter Suffolk with Margaret in his hand.</ACTION> 

SUFFOLK Be what thou wilt, thou art my prisoner.	 Gazes on her. O fairest beauty, do not fear nor fly, For I will touch thee but with reverent hands. I kiss these fingers for eternal peace And lay them gently on thy tender side. Who art thou? Say, that I may honor thee.	 

MARGARET Margaret my name, and daughter to a king, The King of Naples, whosoe’er thou art. 

SUFFOLK An earl I am, and Suffolk am I called. Be not offended, nature’s miracle; Thou art allotted to be ta’en by me. So doth the swan her downy cygnets save, Keeping them prisoner underneath her wings. Yet if this servile usage once offend, Go and be free again as Suffolk’s friend. 

<ACTION>She is going.</ACTION> 

O, stay!  <ACTION>(Aside.) </ACTION> I have no power to let her pass. My hand would free her, but my heart says no. As plays the sun upon the glassy streams, Twinkling another counterfeited beam, So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes. Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak.	 I’ll call for pen and ink and write my mind. Fie, de la Pole, disable not thyself! Hast not a tongue? Is she not here? Wilt thou be daunted at a woman’s sight? Ay. Beauty’s princely majesty is such	 Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough. 

MARGARET Say, Earl of Suffolk, if thy name be so, What ransom must I pay before I pass? For I perceive I am thy prisoner. 

SUFFOLK ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit	 Before thou make a trial of her love? 

MARGARET Why speak’st thou not? What ransom must I pay? 

SUFFOLK ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> She’s beautiful, and therefore to be wooed; She is a woman, therefore to be won. 

MARGARET Wilt thou accept of ransom, yea or no? 

SUFFOLK ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Fond man, remember that thou hast a wife; Then how can Margaret be thy paramour? 

MARGARET ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> I were best to leave him, for he will not hear. 

SUFFOLK, <ACTION>aside</ACTION> There all is marred; there lies a cooling card. 

MARGARET , <ACTION> aside</ACTION> He talks at random; sure the man is mad.	 

SUFFOLK , <ACTION> aside</ACTION> And yet a dispensation may be had. 

MARGARET And yet I would that you would answer me. 

SUFFOLK , <ACTION> aside</ACTION> I’ll win this Lady Margaret. For whom? Why, for my king. Tush, that’s a wooden thing! 

MARGARET ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> He talks of wood. It is some carpenter.	 

SUFFOLK , <ACTION> aside</ACTION> Yet so my fancy may be satisfied, And peace establishèd between these realms. But there remains a scruple in that, too; For though her father be the King of Naples, Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,	 And our nobility will scorn the match. 

MARGARET Hear you, captain? Are you not at leisure? 

SUFFOLK , <ACTION> aside</ACTION> It shall be so, disdain they ne’er so much. Henry is youthful, and will quickly yield.— Madam, I have a secret to reveal.	 

MARGARET , <ACTION> aside</ACTION> What though I be enthralled, he seems a knight, And will not any way dishonor me. 

SUFFOLK Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say. 

MARGARET ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French, And then I need not crave his courtesy.	 

SUFFOLK Sweet madam, give me hearing in a cause. 

MARGARET ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Tush, women have been captivate ere now. 

SUFFOLK Lady, wherefore talk you so? 

MARGARET I cry you mercy, ’tis but quid for quo. 

SUFFOLK Say, gentle princess, would you not suppose	 Your bondage happy, to be made a queen? 

MARGARET To be a queen in bondage is more vile Than is a slave in base servility, For princes should be free. 

SUFFOLK   And so shall you,	 If happy England’s royal king be free. 

MARGARET Why, what concerns his freedom unto me? 

SUFFOLK I’ll undertake to make thee Henry’s queen, To put a golden scepter in thy hand And set a precious crown upon thy head,	 If thou wilt condescend to be my— 

MARGARET  What? 

SUFFOLK His love. 

MARGARET I am unworthy to be Henry’s wife. 

SUFFOLK No, gentle madam, I unworthy am To woo so fair a dame to be his wife, And have no portion in the choice myself. How say you, madam? Are you so content? 

MARGARET An if my father please, I am content. 

SUFFOLK Then call our captains and our colors forth!	 <ACTION>A Soldier exits.</ACTION> And, madam, at your father’s castle walls We’ll crave a parley to confer with him. 

<ACTION>Enter Captains and Trumpets. Sound a parley.Enter Reignier on the walls.</ACTION> 

See, Reignier, see thy daughter prisoner! 

REIGNIER To whom? 

SUFFOLK   To me.	 

REIGNIER  Suffolk, what remedy? I am a soldier and unapt to weep Or to exclaim on Fortune’s fickleness. 

SUFFOLK Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord: Consent, and, for thy Honor give consent,	 Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king, Whom I with pain have wooed and won thereto; And this her easy-held imprisonment Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty. 

REIGNIER Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?	 

SUFFOLK Fair Margaret knows That Suffolk doth not flatter, face, or feign. 

REIGNIER Upon thy princely warrant, I descend To give thee answer of thy just demand. 

<ACTION>He exits from the walls.</ACTION> 

SUFFOLK And here I will expect thy coming.	 

<ACTION>Trumpets sound. Enter Reignier, below.</ACTION> 

REIGNIER Welcome, brave earl, into our territories. Command in Anjou what your Honor pleases. 

SUFFOLK Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child, Fit to be made companion with a king. What answer makes your Grace unto my suit?	 

REIGNIER Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth To be the princely bride of such a lord, Upon condition I may quietly Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou, Free from oppression or the stroke of war,	 My daughter shall be Henry’s, if he please. 

SUFFOLK That is her ransom; I deliver her, And those two counties I will undertake Your Grace shall well and quietly enjoy. 

REIGNIER And I, again in Henry’s royal name	 As deputy unto that gracious king, Give thee her hand for sign of plighted faith. 

SUFFOLK Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks Because this is in traffic of a king. Aside. And yet methinks I could be well content	 To be mine own attorney in this case.— I’ll over then to England with this news, And make this marriage to be solemnized. So farewell, Reignier; set this diamond safe In golden palaces, as it becomes.	 

REIGNIER ,  <ACTION>embracing Suffolk</ACTION> I do embrace thee, as I would embrace The Christian prince King Henry, were he here. 

MARGARET , <ACTION> to Suffolk</ACTION> Farewell, my lord; good wishes, praise, and prayers Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret. 

<ACTION>She is going, as Reignier exits.</ACTION> 

SUFFOLK Farewell, sweet madam. But, hark you, Margaret,	 No princely commendations to my king? 

MARGARET Such commendations as becomes a maid, A virgin, and his servant, say to him. 

SUFFOLK Words sweetly placed and modestly directed. But, madam, I must trouble you again:	 No loving token to his Majesty? 

MARGARET Yes, my good lord: a pure unspotted heart, Never yet taint with love, I send the King. 

SUFFOLK And this withal.	 <ACTION>Kiss her.</ACTION> 

MARGARET That for thyself. I will not so presume	 To send such peevish tokens to a king.	 <ACTION>She exits.</ACTION> 

SUFFOLK O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay. Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth. There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk. Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise;	 Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount And natural graces that extinguish art; Repeat their semblance often on the seas, That, when thou com’st to kneel at Henry’s feet, Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter York, Warwick, Shepherd,and Pucelle, guarded.</ACTION> 

YORK Bring forth that sorceress condemned to burn. 

SHEPHERD Ah, Joan, this kills thy father’s heart outright. Have I sought every country far and near, And, now it is my chance to find thee out, Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?	 Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I’ll die with thee. 

PUCELLE Decrepit miser, base ignoble wretch! I am descended of a gentler blood. Thou art no father nor no friend of mine. 

SHEPHERD Out, out!—My lords, an please you, ’tis not so!	 I did beget her, all the parish knows; Her mother liveth yet, can testify She was the first fruit of my bach’lorship. 

WARWICK Graceless, wilt thou deny thy parentage? 

YORK This argues what her kind of life hath been,	 Wicked and vile; and so her death concludes. 

SHEPHERD Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle! God knows thou art a collop of my flesh, And for thy sake have I shed many a tear. Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan. 

PUCELLE Peasant, avaunt!—You have suborned this man Of purpose to obscure my noble birth. 

SHEPHERD ’Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest The morn that I was wedded to her mother.— Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.	 Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursèd be the time Of thy nativity! I would the milk Thy mother gave thee when thou suck’dst her breast Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!	 Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs afield, I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee! Dost thou deny thy father, cursèd drab? O burn her, burn her! Hanging is too good.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

YORK Take her away, for she hath lived too long	 To fill the world with vicious qualities. 

PUCELLE First, let me tell you whom you have condemned: Not one begotten of a shepherd swain, But issued from the progeny of kings, Virtuous and holy, chosen from above	 By inspiration of celestial grace To work exceeding miracles on earth. I never had to do with wicked spirits. But you, that are polluted with your lusts, Stained with the guiltless blood of innocents, Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices, Because you want the grace that others have, You judge it straight a thing impossible To compass wonders but by help of devils. No, misconceivèd! Joan of Arc hath been	 A virgin from her tender infancy, Chaste and immaculate in very thought, Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effused, Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven. 

YORK Ay, ay.—Away with her to execution.	 

WARWICK And hark you, sirs: because she is a maid, Spare for no faggots; let there be enow. Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake That so her torture may be shortenèd. 

PUCELLE Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?	 Then, Joan, discover thine infirmity, That warranteth by law to be thy privilege: I am with child, you bloody homicides. Murder not then the fruit within my womb, Although you hale me to a violent death. 

YORK Now heaven forfend, the holy maid with child? 

WARWICK ,  <ACTION>to Pucelle</ACTION> The greatest miracle that e’er you wrought! Is all your strict preciseness come to this? 

YORK She and the Dauphin have been juggling. I did imagine what would be her refuge.	 

WARWICK Well, go to, we’ll have no bastards live, Especially since Charles must father it. 

PUCELLE You are deceived; my child is none of his. It was Alanson that enjoyed my love. 

YORK Alanson, that notorious Machiavel?	 It dies an if it had a thousand lives! 

PUCELLE O, give me leave! I have deluded you. ’Twas neither Charles nor yet the Duke I named, But Reignier, King of Naples, that prevailed. 

WARWICK A married man? That’s most intolerable.	 

YORK Why, here’s a girl! I think she knows not well— There were so many—whom she may accuse. 

WARWICK It’s sign she hath been liberal and free. 

YORK And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure!— Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee.	 Use no entreaty, for it is in vain. 

PUCELLE Then lead me hence, with whom I leave my curse: May never glorious sun reflex his beams Upon the country where you make abode, But darkness and the gloomy shade of death	 Environ you, till mischief and despair Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves. 

<ACTION>She exits, led by Guards.</ACTION> 

YORK Break thou in pieces, and consume to ashes, Thou foul accursèd minister of hell! 

<ACTION>Enter Winchester, as Cardinal.</ACTION> 

WINCHESTER Lord Regent, I do greet your Excellence	 With letters of commission from the King. For know, my lords, the states of Christendom, Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils, Have earnestly implored a general peace Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;	 And here at hand the Dauphin and his train Approacheth to confer about some matter. 

YORK Is all our travail turned to this effect? After the slaughter of so many peers, So many captains, gentlemen, and soldiers	 That in this quarrel have been overthrown And sold their bodies for their country’s benefit, Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace? Have we not lost most part of all the towns— By treason, falsehood, and by treachery—	 Our great progenitors had conquerèd? O, Warwick, Warwick, I foresee with grief The utter loss of all the realm of France! 

WARWICK Be patient, York; if we conclude a peace It shall be with such strict and severe covenants	 As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby. 

<ACTION>Enter Charles, Alanson, Bastard,Reignier, with Attendants.</ACTION> 

CHARLES Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed That peaceful truce shall be proclaimed in France, We come to be informèd by yourselves What the conditions of that league must be.	 

YORK Speak, Winchester, for boiling choler chokes The hollow passage of my poisoned voice By sight of these our baleful enemies. 

WINCHESTER Charles and the rest, it is enacted thus: That, in regard King Henry gives consent,	 Of mere compassion and of lenity, To ease your country of distressful war And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace, You shall become true liegemen to his crown. And, Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear	 To pay him tribute and submit thyself, Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him, And still enjoy thy regal dignity. 

ALANSON Must he be then as shadow of himself— Adorn his temples with a coronet,	 And yet, in substance and authority, Retain but privilege of a private man? This proffer is absurd and reasonless. 

CHARLES ’Tis known already that I am possessed With more than half the Gallian territories,	 And therein reverenced for their lawful king. Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquished, Detract so much from that prerogative As to be called but viceroy of the whole? No, lord ambassador, I’ll rather keep	 That which I have than, coveting for more, Be cast from possibility of all. 

YORK Insulting Charles, hast thou by secret means Used intercession to obtain a league And, now the matter grows to compromise, Stand’st thou aloof upon comparison? Either accept the title thou usurp’st, Of benefit proceeding from our king And not of any challenge of desert, Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.	 

REIGNIER , <ACTION> aside to Charles</ACTION> My lord, you do not well in obstinacy To cavil in the course of this contract. If once it be neglected, ten to one We shall not find like opportunity. 

ALANSON , <ACTION> aside to Charles</ACTION> To say the truth, it is your policy	 To save your subjects from such massacre And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen By our proceeding in hostility; And therefore take this compact of a truce Although you break it when your pleasure serves.	 

WARWICK How say’st thou, Charles? Shall our condition stand? 

CHARLES It shall—only reserved you claim no interest In any of our towns of garrison. 

YORK Then swear allegiance to his Majesty, As thou art knight, never to disobey	 Nor be rebellious to the crown of England, Thou nor thy nobles, to the crown of England. 

<ACTION>Charles, Alanson, Bastard, and Reignierswear allegiance to Henry.</ACTION> 

So, now dismiss your army when you please; Hang up your ensigns, let your drums be still, For here we entertain a solemn peace.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
