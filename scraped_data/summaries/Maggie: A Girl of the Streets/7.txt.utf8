Maggie starts getting stressed about her wardrobe. Dating Pete has upped the ante, and it seems like every lady on the street has nicer clothes. This stinks.

She also starts to worry that she's going to become an old hag, like some of her co-workers at the collar and cuff factory.

Pete is showing Maggie a really good time: dime shows, menageries, museums, a whole world of culture she never knew existed. Ohâ€”and the melodramas with damsels in distress. What a knight in shining armor Pete is.

These shows are infinitely entertaining. The villains so villainous and the heroes so, well, heroic. Maggie is ready to climb on stage and become a character in one of the plays; she wonders if she might act the part of a classy lady just like actresses do on stage.
