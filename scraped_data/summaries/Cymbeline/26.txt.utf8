In the stocks, Posthumus talks of his fate. He just wants to die for what he's done; he doesn't mind being in prison.

Posthumus decides to speak to Imogen alone by falling asleep. Um, okay.

Then it gets weird. A bunch of ghosts visit Posthumus in prison. They're the ghosts of his dead father, mother, and brothers. They circle around him as he sleeps.

Posthumus's dead family knows he has done a great service to his country, but they think it's unfair that he's had to go through so much: banishment, trickery, false imprisonment, you name it.

Posthumus's family feels for him: he's valiant and brave, and he's been wronged again and again.

So the ghosts ask Jupiter, king of the gods, to grieve with them and take pity on Posthumus. What else is there to do?

Then Jupiter himself descends into the prison cell on the back of an eagle. He's got thunderbolts and lighting. No, really: he does.

The ghosts fall to their knees and listen to Jupiter. He's annoyed by these spirits: surely this isn't worth his time, right?

Jupiter tells the ghosts that he sympathizes with Posthumus and will help him.

Posthumus wakes up and thinks about his dream. He reads an oracle on the ground: it talks about a lion's whelp and a stately cedar.

Posthumus is really, really confused at this point. (And frankly, so are we.) He figures it's all just part of a weird dream.

The guards enter and talk about how Posthumus will soon be executed. One of the guards says something like, "Chin up: at least you don't have to pay any more bar tabs." Gee, that's a relief.

Posthumus doesn't care. He tells the guards he'd rather die than live.

Just in the nick of time, a messenger enters. Cymbeline has requested to see Posthumus.

Once everyone else is gone, the jailer tells us he's never known a prisoner to care less about staying alive.
