<ACTION>Enter Imogen and Pisanio.</ACTION> 

IMOGEN I would thou grew’st unto the shores o’ th’ haven And questionedst every sail. If he should write And I not have it, ’twere a paper lost As offered mercy is. What was the last That he spake to thee?	 

PISANIO  It was his queen, his queen! 

IMOGEN Then waved his handkerchief? 

PISANIO  And kissed it, madam. 

IMOGEN Senseless linen, happier therein than I. And that was all?	 

PISANIO  No, madam. For so long As he could make me with this eye or ear Distinguish him from others, he did keep The deck, with glove or hat or handkerchief Still waving, as the fits and stirs of ’s mind	 Could best express how slow his soul sailed on, How swift his ship. 

IMOGEN  Thou shouldst have made him As little as a crow, or less, ere left To after-eye him.	 

PISANIO Madam, so I did. 

IMOGEN I would have broke mine eyestrings, cracked them, but To look upon him till the diminution Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle;	 Nay, followed him till he had melted from The smallness of a gnat to air; and then Have turned mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio, When shall we hear from him? 

PISANIO  Be assured, madam,	 With his next vantage. 

IMOGEN I did not take my leave of him, but had Most pretty things to say. Ere I could tell him How I would think on him at certain hours Such thoughts and such; or I could make him swear	 The shes of Italy should not betray Mine interest and his honor; or have charged him At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight T’ encounter me with orisons, for then I am in heaven for him; or ere I could	 Give him that parting kiss which I had set Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father, And like the tyrannous breathing of the north Shakes all our buds from growing. 

<ACTION>Enter a Lady.</ACTION> 

LADY The Queen, madam,	 Desires your Highness’ company. 

IMOGEN ,  <ACTION>to Pisanio</ACTION> Those things I bid you do, get them dispatched. I will attend the Queen. 

PISANIO  Madam, I shall. <ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
