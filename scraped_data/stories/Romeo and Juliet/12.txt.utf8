<ACTION>Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.</ACTION> 

FRIAR LAWRENCE So smile the heavens upon this holy act That after-hours with sorrow chide us not. 

ROMEO Amen, amen. But come what sorrow can, It cannot countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight.	 Do thou but close our hands with holy words, Then love-devouring death do what he dare, It is enough I may but call her mine. 

FRIAR LAWRENCE These violent delights have violent ends And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,	 Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey Is loathsome in his own deliciousness And in the taste confounds the appetite. Therefore love moderately. Long love doth so. Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.	 

<ACTION>Enter Juliet.</ACTION> 

Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot Will ne’er wear out the everlasting flint. A lover may bestride the gossamers That idles in the wanton summer air, And yet not fall, so light is vanity.	 

JULIET Good even to my ghostly confessor. 

FRIAR LAWRENCE Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both. 

JULIET As much to him, else is his thanks too much. 

ROMEO Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy Be heaped like mine, and that thy skill be more	 To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath This neighbor air, and let rich music’s tongue Unfold the imagined happiness that both Receive in either by this dear encounter. 

JULIET Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,	 Brags of his substance, not of ornament. They are but beggars that can count their worth, But my true love is grown to such excess I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth. 

FRIAR LAWRENCE Come, come with me, and we will make short work,	 For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone Till Holy Church incorporate two in one. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
