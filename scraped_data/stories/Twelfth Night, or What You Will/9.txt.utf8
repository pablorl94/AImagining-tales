<ACTION>Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Fabian.</ACTION> 

TOBY Come thy ways, Signior Fabian. 

FABIAN Nay, I’ll come. If I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be boiled to death with melancholy. 

TOBY Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?	 

FABIAN I would exult, man. You know he brought me out o’ favor with my lady about a bearbaiting here. 

TOBY To anger him, we’ll have the bear again, and we will fool him black and blue, shall we not, Sir Andrew?	 

ANDREW  An we do not, it is pity of our lives. 

<ACTION>Enter Maria.</ACTION> 

TOBY Here comes the little villain.—How now, my metal of India? 

MARIA Get you all three into the boxtree. Malvolio’s coming down this walk. He has been yonder i’ the	 sun practicing behavior to his own shadow this half hour. Observe him, for the love of mockery, for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him. Close, in the name of jesting!  <ACTION>They hide.</ACTION> Lie thou there putting down the letter, for here comes	 the trout that must be caught with tickling. 

<ACTION>She exits.</ACTION> 

Enter Malvolio. 

MALVOLIO ’Tis but fortune, all is fortune. Maria once told me she did affect me, and I have heard herself come thus near, that should she fancy, it should be one of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a	 more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her. What should I think on ’t? 

TOBY ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Here’s an overweening rogue. 

FABIAN ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkeycock of him. How he jets under his advanced	 plumes! 

ANDREW ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> ’Slight, I could so beat the rogue! 

TOBY ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Peace, I say. 

MALVOLIO To be Count Malvolio. 

TOBY ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Ah, rogue!	 

ANDREW ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Pistol him, pistol him! 

TOBY ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Peace, peace! 

MALVOLIO There is example for ’t. The lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe. 

ANDREW ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Fie on him, Jezebel!	 

FABIAN ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> O, peace, now he’s deeply in. Look how imagination blows him. 

MALVOLIO Having been three months married to her, sitting in my state— 

TOBY ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!	 

MALVOLIO Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet gown, having come from a daybed where I have left Olivia sleeping— 

TOBY ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Fire and brimstone! 

FABIAN ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> O, peace, peace!	 

MALVOLIO And then to have the humor of state; and after a demure travel of regard, telling them I know my place, as I would they should do theirs, to ask for my kinsman Toby— 

TOBY ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Bolts and shackles!	 

FABIAN ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> O, peace, peace, peace! Now, now. 

MALVOLIO Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make out for him. I frown the while, and perchance wind up my watch, or play with my—some rich jewel. Toby approaches; curtsies there to me—	 

TOBY ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Shall this fellow live? 

FABIAN ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace! 

MALVOLIO I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar smile with an austere regard of	 control— 

TOBY ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> And does not Toby take you a blow o’ the lips then? 

MALVOLIO  Saying, “Cousin Toby, my fortunes, having cast me on your niece, give me this prerogative of	 speech—” 

TOBY ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> What, what? 

MALVOLIO  “You must amend your drunkenness.” 

TOBY ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Out, scab! 

FABIAN ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Nay, patience, or we break the sinews	 of our plot! 

MALVOLIO  “Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish knight—” 

ANDREW ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> That’s me, I warrant you. 

MALVOLIO  “One Sir Andrew.”	 

ANDREW ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> I knew ’twas I, for many do call me fool. 

MALVOLIO ,  <ACTION>seeing the letter </ACTION> What employment have we here? 

FABIAN ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Now is the woodcock near the gin.	 

TOBY ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> O, peace, and the spirit of humors intimate reading aloud to him. 

MALVOLIO ,  <ACTION>taking up the letter </ACTION> By my life, this is my lady’s hand! These be her very c’s, her u’s, and her t’s, and thus she makes her great P’s. It is in	 contempt of question her hand. 

ANDREW ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Her c’s, her u’s, and her t’s. Why that? 

MALVOLIO <ACTION>reads "</ACTION> To the unknown beloved, this, and my good wishes—" Her very phrases! By your leave, wax. Soft. And the impressure her Lucrece, with which	 she uses to seal—’tis my lady!  <ACTION>He opens the letter.</ACTION> To whom should this be? 

FABIAN ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> This wins him, liver and all. 

MALVOLIO <ACTION>reads</ACTION> "Jove knows I love, But who?	 Lips, do not move; No man must know." 

“No man must know.” What follows? The numbers altered. “No man must know.” If this should be thee, Malvolio!	 

TOBY ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Marry, hang thee, brock! 

MALVOLIO <ACTION>reads</ACTION> "I may command where I adore, But silence, like a Lucrece knife, With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore; M.O.A.I. doth sway my life."  

FABIAN ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> A fustian riddle! 

TOBY ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Excellent wench, say I. 

MALVOLIO “M.O.A.I. doth sway my life.” Nay, but first let me see, let me see, let me see. 

FABIAN ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> What dish o’ poison has she dressed	 him! 

TOBY ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> And with what wing the staniel checks at it! 

MALVOLIO “I may command where I adore.” Why, she may command me; I serve her; she is my lady. Why,	 this is evident to any formal capacity. There is no obstruction in this. And the end—what should that alphabetical position portend? If I could make that resemble something in me! Softly! “M.O.A.I.”— 

TOBY ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> O, ay, make up that.—He is now at a cold	 scent. 

FABIAN ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Sowter will cry upon ’t for all this, though it be as rank as a fox. 

MALVOLIO “M”—Malvolio. “M”—why, that begins my name!	 

FABIAN ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Did not I say he would work it out? The cur is excellent at faults. 

MALVOLIO “M.” But then there is no consonancy in the sequel that suffers under probation. “A” should follow, but “O” does.	 

FABIAN ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> And “O” shall end, I hope. 

TOBY ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Ay, or I’ll cudgel him and make him cry “O.” 

MALVOLIO And then “I” comes behind. 

FABIAN ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you	 might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes before you. 

MALVOLIO  “M.O.A.I.” This simulation is not as the former, and yet to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for every one of these letters are in my name.	 Soft, here follows prose. 

<ACTION>He reads. </ACTION> 

"If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I am above thee, but be not afraid of greatness. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon ’em. Thy fates open	 their hands. Let thy blood and spirit embrace them. And, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be, cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants. Let thy tongue tang arguments of state. Put thyself into the trick of singularity.	 She thus advises thee that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy yellow stockings and wished to see thee ever cross-gartered. I say, remember. Go to, thou art made, if thou desir’st to be so. If not, let me see thee a steward still, the fellow of	 servants, and not worthy to touch Fortune’s fingers. Farewell. She that would alter services with thee, The Fortunate-Unhappy." 

Daylight and champian discovers not more! This is open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors, I	 will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man. I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of late, she	 did praise my leg being cross-gartered, and in this she manifests herself to my love and, with a kind of injunction, drives me to these habits of her liking. I thank my stars, I am happy. I will be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with	 the swiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a postscript. 

<ACTION>He reads. </ACTION> 

"Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou entertain’st my love, let it appear in thy smiling; thy smiles become thee well. Therefore in my	 presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee." 

Jove, I thank thee! I will smile. I will do everything that thou wilt have me.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

FABIAN I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.	 

TOBY I could marry this wench for this device. 

ANDREW So could I too. 

TOBY  And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest. 

ANDREW Nor I neither.	 

<ACTION>Enter Maria.</ACTION> 

FABIAN Here comes my noble gull-catcher. 

TOBY  Wilt thou set thy foot o’ my neck? 

ANDREW Or o’ mine either? 

TOBY Shall I play my freedom at tray-trip and become thy bondslave?	 

ANDREW I’ faith, or I either? 

TOBY Why, thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad. 

MARIA Nay, but say true, does it work upon him? 

TOBY Like aqua vitae with a midwife.	 

MARIA If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark his first approach before my lady. He will come to her in yellow stockings, and ’tis a color she abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests; and he will smile upon her, which will now	 be so unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him into a notable contempt. If you will see it, follow me. 

TOBY To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil	 of wit! 

ANDREW I’ll make one, too. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
