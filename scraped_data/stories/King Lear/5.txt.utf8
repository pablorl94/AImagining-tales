<ACTION>Enter Edmund, the Bastard and Curan, severally.</ACTION> 

EDMUND  Save thee, Curan. 

CURAN And you, sir. I have been with your father and given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his duchess will be here with him this night. 

EDMUND  How comes that?	 

CURAN  Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad?—I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but ear-kissing arguments. 

EDMUND Not I. Pray you, what are they? 

CURAN Have you heard of no likely wars toward ’twixt	 the dukes of Cornwall and Albany? 

EDMUND Not a word. 

CURAN  You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

EDMUND The Duke be here tonight? The better, best. This weaves itself perforce into my business.	 My father hath set guard to take my brother, And I have one thing of a queasy question Which I must act. Briefness and fortune work!— Brother, a word. Descend. Brother, I say! 

<ACTION>Enter Edgar.</ACTION> 

My father watches. O sir, fly this place!	 Intelligence is given where you are hid. You have now the good advantage of the night. Have you not spoken ’gainst the Duke of Cornwall? He’s coming hither, now, i’ th’ night, i’ th’ haste, And Regan with him. Have you nothing said	 Upon his party ’gainst the Duke of Albany? Advise yourself. 

EDGAR I am sure on ’t, not a word. 

EDMUND I hear my father coming. Pardon me. In cunning I must draw my sword upon you.	 Draw. Seem to defend yourself. Now, quit you well.	 <ACTION>They draw.</ACTION> Yield! Come before my father! Light, hoa, here! Aside to Edgar. Fly, brother.—Torches, torches! —So, farewell.	 <ACTION>Edgar exits.  </ACTION> Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion Of my more fierce endeavor. I have seen drunkards Do more than this in sport.	 <ACTION>He wounds his arm.</ACTION> Father, father! Stop, stop! No help?	 

<ACTION>Enter Gloucester, and Servants with torches.</ACTION> 

GLOUCESTER Now, Edmund, where’s the villain? 

EDMUND Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out, Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon To stand auspicious mistress.	 

GLOUCESTER But where is he? 

EDMUND Look, sir, I bleed. 

GLOUCESTER  Where is the villain, Edmund? 

EDMUND Fled this way, sir, when by no means he could—	 

GLOUCESTER Pursue him, ho! Go after.  <ACTION>Servants exit.</ACTION> By no means what? 

EDMUND Persuade me to the murder of your Lordship, But that I told him the revenging gods ’Gainst parricides did all the thunder bend,	 Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond The child was bound to th’ father—sir, in fine, Seeing how loathly opposite I stood To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion With his preparèd sword he charges home	 My unprovided body, lanced mine arm; And when he saw my best alarumed spirits, Bold in the quarrel’s right, roused to th’ encounter, Or whether ghasted by the noise I made, Full suddenly he fled.	 

GLOUCESTER Let him fly far!  Not in this land shall he remain uncaught,  And found—dispatch. The noble duke my master,  My worthy arch and patron, comes tonight.  By his authority I will proclaim it	 That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,  Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;  He that conceals him, death.  

EDMUND When I dissuaded him from his intent And found him pight to do it, with curst speech	 I threatened to discover him. He replied “Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think If I would stand against thee, would the reposal Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee Make thy words faithed? No. What I should	 deny— As this I would, though thou didst produce My very character—I’d turn it all To thy suggestion, plot, and damnèd practice. And thou must make a dullard of the world	 If they not thought the profits of my death Were very pregnant and potential spurs To make thee seek it.” 

GLOUCESTER O strange and fastened villain! Would he deny his letter, said he?	 I never got him.	Tucket within. Hark, the Duke’s trumpets. I know not why he comes. All ports I’ll bar. The villain shall not ’scape. The Duke must grant me that. Besides, his picture	 I will send far and near, that all the kingdom May have due note of him. And of my land, Loyal and natural boy, I’ll work the means To make thee capable. 

<ACTION>Enter Cornwall, Regan, and Attendants.</ACTION> 

CORNWALL How now, my noble friend? Since I came hither,	 Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news. 

REGAN If it be true, all vengeance comes too short Which can pursue th’ offender. How dost, my lord?	 

GLOUCESTER O madam, my old heart is cracked; it’s cracked. 

REGAN What, did my father’s godson seek your life? He whom my father named, your Edgar? 

GLOUCESTER O lady, lady, shame would have it hid! 

REGAN Was he not companion with the riotous knights	 That tended upon my father? 

GLOUCESTER I know not, madam. ’Tis too bad, too bad. 

EDMUND Yes, madam, he was of that consort. 

REGAN No marvel, then, though he were ill affected. ’Tis they have put him on the old man’s death,	 To have th’ expense and waste of his revenues. I have this present evening from my sister Been well informed of them, and with such cautions That if they come to sojourn at my house I’ll not be there.	 

CORNWALL Nor I, assure thee, Regan.— Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father A childlike office. 

EDMUND It was my duty, sir. 

GLOUCESTER He did bewray his practice, and received	 This hurt you see striving to apprehend him. 

CORNWALL  Is he pursued? 

GLOUCESTER Ay, my good lord. 

CORNWALL If he be taken, he shall never more Be feared of doing harm. Make your own purpose,	 How in my strength you please.—For you, Edmund, Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant So much commend itself, you shall be ours. Natures of such deep trust we shall much need. You we first seize on.	 

EDMUND I shall serve you, sir, Truly, however else. 

GLOUCESTER For him I thank your Grace. 

CORNWALL You know not why we came to visit you— 

REGAN Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night.	 Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise, Wherein we must have use of your advice. Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister, Of differences, which I best thought it fit To answer from our home. The several messengers	 From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend, Lay comforts to your bosom and bestow Your needful counsel to our businesses, Which craves the instant use. 

GLOUCESTER I serve you, madam.	 Your Graces are right welcome. 

<ACTION>Flourish. They exit.</ACTION>
