<ACTION>Enter Thaliard alone.</ACTION> 

THALIARD  So this is Tyre, and this the court. Here must I kill King Pericles; and if I do it not, I am sure to be hanged at home. ’Tis dangerous. Well, I perceive he was a wise fellow and had good discretion that, being bid to ask what he would of the	 king, desired he might know none of his secrets. Now do I see he had some reason for ’t, for if a king bid a man be a villain, he’s bound by the indenture of his oath to be one. Husht! Here comes the lords of Tyre.	 <ACTION>He steps aside.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Helicanus and Escanes, with other Lords.</ACTION> 

HELICANUS You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre, Further to question me of your king’s departure. His sealed commission left in trust with me Does speak sufficiently he’s gone to travel. 

THALIARD ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> How? The King gone?	 

HELICANUS If further yet you will be satisfied Why, as it were, unlicensed of your loves He would depart, I’ll give some light unto you. Being at Antioch— 

THALIARD ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> What from Antioch?	 

HELICANUS Royal Antiochus, on what cause I know not, Took some displeasure at him—at least he judged so; And doubting lest he had erred or sinned, To show his sorrow, he’d correct himself; So puts himself unto the shipman’s toil,	 With whom each minute threatens life or death. 

THALIARD , <ACTION> aside </ACTION> Well, I perceive I shall not be hanged now, although I would; but since he’s gone, the King’s ears it must please. He ’scaped the land to perish at the sea. I’ll present myself.—Peace to the	 lords of Tyre! 

HELICANUS Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome. 

THALIARD From him I come with message unto princely Pericles, but since my landing I have understood your lord has betook himself to unknown travels.	 Now message must return from whence it came. 

HELICANUS  We have no reason to desire it, Commended to our master, not to us. Yet ere you shall depart, this we desire: As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
