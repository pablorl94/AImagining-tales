<ACTION>Enter Fluellen and Gower.</ACTION> 

FLUELLEN  Kill the poys and the luggage! ’Tis expressly against the law of arms. ’Tis as arrant a piece of knavery, mark you now, as can be offert, in your conscience now, is it not? 

GOWER ’Tis certain there’s not a boy left alive, and	 the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha’ done this slaughter. Besides, they have burned and carried away all that was in the King’s tent, wherefore the King, most worthily, hath caused every soldier to cut his prisoner’s throat. O, ’tis a	 gallant king! 

FLUELLEN  Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain Gower. What call you the town’s name where Alexander the Pig was born? 

GOWER Alexander the Great.	 

FLUELLEN   Why, I pray you, is not “pig” great? The pig, or the great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the magnanimous, are all one reckonings, save the phrase is a little variations. 

GOWER I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon.	 His father was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it. 

FLUELLEN I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn. I tell you, captain, if you look in the maps of the ’orld, I warrant you sall find, in the comparisons between Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations, look you, is both alike. There is a river in Macedon, and there is also, moreover, a river at Monmouth. It is called Wye at Monmouth, but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other river.	 But ’tis all one; ’tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers, and there is salmons in both. If you mark Alexander’s life well, Harry of Monmouth’s life is come after it indifferent well, for there is figures in all things. Alexander, God knows and you know, in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his cholers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations, and also being a little intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales and his angers, look you, kill his best friend, Cleitus.	 

GOWER   Our king is not like him in that. He never killed any of his friends. 

FLUELLEN  It is not well done, mark you now, to take the tales out of my mouth ere it is made and finished. I speak but in the figures and comparisons	 of it. As Alexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in his ales and his cups, so also Harry Monmouth, being in his right wits and his good judgments, turned away the fat knight with the great-belly doublet; he was full of jests and gipes and knaveries	 and mocks—I have forgot his name. 

GOWER Sir John Falstaff. 

FLUELLEN   That is he. I’ll tell you, there is good men porn at Monmouth. 

GOWER Here comes his Majesty.	 

<ACTION>Alarum. Enter King Harry, Exeter, Warwick, Gloucester,Heralds and Bourbon with other prisoners. Flourish.</ACTION> 

KING HENRY I was not angry since I came to France Until this instant. Take a trumpet, herald. Ride thou unto the horsemen on yond hill. If they will fight with us, bid them come down, Or void the field. They do offend our sight.	 If they’ll do neither, we will come to them And make them skirr away as swift as stones Enforcèd from the old Assyrian slings. Besides, we’ll cut the throats of those we have, And not a man of them that we shall take	 Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so. 

<ACTION>Enter Montjoy.</ACTION> 

EXETER Here comes the herald of the French, my liege. 

GLOUCESTER His eyes are humbler than they used to be. 

KING HENRY How now, what means this, herald? Know’st thou not		 That I have fined these bones of mine for ransom? Com’st thou again for ransom? 

MONTJOY   No, great king. I come to thee for charitable license, That we may wander o’er this bloody field	 To book our dead and then to bury them, To sort our nobles from our common men, For many of our princes—woe the while!— Lie drowned and soaked in mercenary blood. So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs	 In blood of princes, and the wounded steeds Fret fetlock deep in gore, and with wild rage Yerk out their armèd heels at their dead masters, Killing them twice. O, give us leave, great king, To view the field in safety and dispose	 Of their dead bodies. 

KING HENRY I tell thee truly, herald, I know not if the day be ours or no, For yet a many of your horsemen peer And gallop o’er the field.	 

MONTJOY The day is yours. 

KING HENRY Praised be God, and not our strength, for it! What is this castle called that stands hard by? 

MONTJOY   They call it Agincourt. 

KING HENRY Then call we this the field of Agincourt, Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus. 

FLUELLEN Your grandfather of famous memory, an ’t please your Majesty, and your great-uncle Edward the Plack Prince of Wales, as I have read in the chronicles, fought a most prave pattle here in	 France. 

KING HENRY They did, Fluellen. 

FLUELLEN  Your Majesty says very true. If your Majesties is remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a garden where leeks did grow, wearing	 leeks in their Monmouth caps, which, your Majesty know, to this hour is an honorable badge of the service. And I do believe your Majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek upon Saint Tavy’s day. 

KING HENRY I wear it for a memorable honor,	 For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman. 

FLUELLEN All the water in Wye cannot wash your Majesty’s Welsh plood out of your pody, I can tell you that. God pless it and preserve it as long as it pleases his Grace and his Majesty too.	 

KING HENRY Thanks, good my countryman. 

FLUELLEN By Jeshu, I am your Majesty’s countryman, I care not who know it. I will confess it to all the ’orld. I need not to be ashamed of your Majesty, praised be God, so long as your Majesty is an	 honest man. 

KING HENRY God keep me so.—Our heralds, go with him. Bring me just notice of the numbers dead On both our parts. 

<ACTION>Montjoy, English Heralds, and Gower exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Williams.</ACTION> 

Call yonder fellow hither.	 

EXETER Soldier, you must come to the King. 

KING HENRY   Soldier, why wear’st thou that glove in thy cap? 

WILLIAMS An ’t please your Majesty, ’tis the gage of one that I should fight withal, if he be alive. 

KING HENRY An Englishman? 

WILLIAMS An ’t please your Majesty, a rascal that swaggered with me last night, who, if alive and ever dare to challenge this glove, I have sworn to take him a box o’ th’ ear, or if I can see my glove in his	 cap, which he swore, as he was a soldier, he would wear if alive, I will strike it out soundly. 

KING HENRY What think you, Captain Fluellen, is it fit this soldier keep his oath? 

FLUELLEN He is a craven and a villain else, an ’t	 please your Majesty, in my conscience. 

KING HENRY It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort, quite from the answer of his degree. 

FLUELLEN Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is, as Lucifer and Beelzebub himself, it is	 necessary, look your Grace, that he keep his vow and his oath. If he be perjured, see you now, his reputation is as arrant a villain and a Jack Sauce as ever his black shoe trod upon God’s ground and His earth, in my conscience, la.	 

KING HENRY Then keep thy vow, sirrah, when thou meet’st the fellow. 

WILLIAMS So I will, my liege, as I live. 

KING HENRY Who serv’st thou under? 

WILLIAMS Under Captain Gower, my liege.	 

FLUELLEN  Gower is a good captain, and is good knowledge and literatured in the wars. 

KING HENRY  Call him hither to me, soldier. 

WILLIAMS I will, my liege.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

KING HENRY, <ACTION>giving Fluellen Williams’s glove</ACTION> Here,  Fluellen, wear thou this favor for me, and stick it in thy cap. When Alençon and myself were down together, I plucked this glove from his helm. If any man challenge this, he is a friend to Alençon and an enemy to our person. If thou encounter any such,	 apprehend him, an thou dost me love. 

FLUELLEN ,  <ACTION>putting the glove in his cap</ACTION> Your Grace does me as great honors as can be desired in the hearts of his subjects. I would fain see the man that has but two legs that shall find himself aggriefed at	 this glove, that is all; but I would fain see it once, an please God of His grace that I might see. 

KING HENRY Know’st thou Gower? 

FLUELLEN He is my dear friend, an please you. 

KING HENRY Pray thee, go seek him, and bring him to	 my tent. 

FLUELLEN I will fetch him.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

KING HENRY My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester, Follow Fluellen closely at the heels. The glove which I have given him for a favor	 May haply purchase him a box o’ th’ ear. It is the soldier’s. I by bargain should Wear it myself. Follow, good cousin Warwick. If that the soldier strike him, as I judge By his blunt bearing he will keep his word,	 Some sudden mischief may arise of it, For I do know Fluellen valiant And, touched with choler, hot as gunpowder, And quickly will return an injury. Follow, and see there be no harm between them.—	 Go you with me, uncle of Exeter. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
