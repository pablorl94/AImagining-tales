<ACTION>Sound a flourish. Enter Charles the Dauphin,Alanson, and Reignier, marching with Drumand Soldiers.</ACTION> 

CHARLES Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens So in the Earth, to this day is not known. Late did he shine upon the English side; Now we are victors; upon us he smiles. What towns of any moment but we have?	 At pleasure here we lie, near Orleance. Otherwhiles, the famished English, like pale ghosts, Faintly besiege us one hour in a month. 

ALANSON They want their porridge and their fat bull beeves. Either they must be dieted like mules	 And have their provender tied to their mouths, Or piteous they will look, like drownèd mice. 

REIGNIER Let’s raise the siege. Why live we idly here? Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear. Remaineth none but mad-brained Salisbury,	 And he may well in fretting spend his gall; Nor men nor money hath he to make war. 

CHARLES Sound, sound alarum! We will rush on them. Now for the honor of the forlorn French! Him I forgive my death that killeth me	 When he sees me go back one foot, or fly. 

<ACTION>They exit. Here alarum. They are beatenback by the English, with great loss.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Charles, Alanson, and Reignier.</ACTION> 

CHARLES Whoever saw the like? What men have I! Dogs, cowards, dastards! I would ne’er have fled But that they left me ’midst my enemies. 

REIGNIER Salisbury is a desperate homicide.	 He fighteth as one weary of his life. The other lords, like lions wanting food, Do rush upon us as their hungry prey. 

ALANSON Froissart, a countryman of ours, records England all Olivers and Rolands bred	 During the time Edward the Third did reign. More truly now may this be verified, For none but Samsons and Goliases It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten! Lean rawboned rascals! Who would e’er suppose	 They had such courage and audacity? 

CHARLES Let’s leave this town, for they are hare-brained slaves, And hunger will enforce them to be more eager. Of old I know them; rather with their teeth The walls they’ll tear down than forsake the siege.	 

REIGNIER I think by some odd gimmers or device Their arms are set, like clocks, still to strike on; Else ne’er could they hold out so as they do. By my consent, we’ll even let them alone. 

ALANSON  Be it so.	 

<ACTION>Enter the Bastard of Orleance.</ACTION> 

BASTARD Where’s the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him. 

CHARLES Bastard of Orleance, thrice welcome to us. 

BASTARD Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appalled. Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence? Be not dismayed, for succor is at hand.	 A holy maid hither with me I bring, Which, by a vision sent to her from heaven, Ordainèd is to raise this tedious siege And drive the English forth the bounds of France. The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,	 Exceeding the nine Sibyls of old Rome. What’s past and what’s to come she can descry. Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words, For they are certain and unfallible. 

CHARLES Go call her in.	 <ACTION>Bastard exits.</ACTION> But first, to try her skill, Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place; Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern. By this means shall we sound what skill she hath. 

<ACTION>Enter Bastard, with Joan la Pucelle.</ACTION> 

REIGNIER, <ACTION>as Charles</ACTION> Fair maid, is ’t thou wilt do these wondrous feats?	 

PUCELLE Reignier, is ’t thou that thinkest to beguile me? Where is the Dauphin?—Come, come from behind. I know thee well, though never seen before. Be not amazed; there’s nothing hid from me. In private will I talk with thee apart.—	 Stand back, you lords, and give us leave a while. 

REIGNIER She takes upon her bravely at first dash. 

<ACTION>Alanson, Reignier, and Bastard exit.</ACTION> 

PUCELLE Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd’s daughter, My wit untrained in any kind of art. Heaven and Our Lady gracious hath it pleased	 To shine on my contemptible estate. Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs, And to sun’s parching heat displayed my cheeks, God’s Mother deignèd to appear to me, And in a vision full of majesty	 Willed me to leave my base vocation And free my country from calamity. Her aid she promised and assured success. In complete glory she revealed herself; And whereas I was black and swart before,	 With those clear rays which she infused on me That beauty am I blest with, which you may see. Ask me what question thou canst possible, And I will answer unpremeditated. My courage try by combat, if thou dar’st,	 And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex. Resolve on this: thou shalt be fortunate If thou receive me for thy warlike mate. 

CHARLES Thou hast astonished me with thy high terms. Only this proof I’ll of thy valor make:	 In single combat thou shalt buckle with me, And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true; Otherwise I renounce all confidence. 

PUCELLE I am prepared. Here is my keen-edged sword, Decked with fine flower-de-luces on each side—	 <ACTION>Aside.</ACTION> The which at Touraine, in Saint Katherine’s churchyard, Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth. 

CHARLES Then come, a’ God’s name! I fear no woman. 

PUCELLE And while I live, I’ll ne’er fly from a man.	 

<ACTION>Here they fight, andJoan la Pucelle overcomes.</ACTION> 

CHARLES Stay, stay thy hands! Thou art an Amazon, And fightest with the sword of Deborah. 

PUCELLE Christ’s mother helps me; else I were too weak. 

CHARLES Whoe’er helps thee, ’tis thou that must help me. Impatiently I burn with thy desire.	 My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued. Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so, Let me thy servant and not sovereign be. ’Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus. 

PUCELLE I must not yield to any rights of love, For my profession’s sacred from above. When I have chasèd all thy foes from hence, Then will I think upon a recompense. 

CHARLES Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall. 

<ACTION>Enter Reignier and Alanson.</ACTION> 

REIGNIER ,  <ACTION>aside to Alanson</ACTION> My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.	 

ALANSON ,  <ACTION>aside to Reignier</ACTION> Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock, Else ne’er could he so long protract his speech. 

REIGNIER ,  <ACTION>aside to Alanson</ACTION> Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean? 

ALANSON ,  <ACTION>aside to Reignier</ACTION> He may mean more than we poor men do know. These women are shrewd tempters with their	 tongues. 

REIGNIER , <ACTION> to Charles</ACTION> My lord, where are you? What devise you on? Shall we give o’er Orleance, or no? 

PUCELLE Why, no, I say. Distrustful recreants, Fight till the last gasp. I’ll be your guard.	 

CHARLES What she says I’ll confirm: we’ll fight it out. 

PUCELLE Assigned am I to be the English scourge. This night the siege assuredly I’ll raise. Expect Saint Martin’s summer, halcyons’ days, Since I have enterèd into these wars.	 Glory is like a circle in the water, Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself Till by broad spreading it disperse to naught. With Henry’s death, the English circle ends; Dispersèd are the glories it included.	 Now am I like that proud insulting ship Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once. 

CHARLES Was Mahomet inspirèd with a dove? Thou with an eagle art inspirèd then. Helen, the mother of great Constantine,	 Nor yet Saint Philip’s daughters were like thee. Bright star of Venus, fall’n down on the Earth, How may I reverently worship thee enough? 

ALANSON Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege. 

REIGNIER Woman, do what thou canst to save our honors.	 Drive them from Orleance and be immortalized. 

CHARLES Presently we’ll try. Come, let’s away about it. No prophet will I trust if she prove false. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
