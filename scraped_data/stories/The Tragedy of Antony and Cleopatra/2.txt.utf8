<ACTION>Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Alexas, and Iras.</ACTION> 

CLEOPATRA Where is he? 

CHARMIAN I did not see him since. 

CLEOPATRA ,  <ACTION>to Alexas</ACTION> See where he is, who’s with him, what he does. I did not send you. If you find him sad, Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report	 That I am sudden sick. Quick, and return. 

<ACTION>Alexas exits.</ACTION> 

CHARMIAN Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly, You do not hold the method to enforce The like from him. 

CLEOPATRA What should I do I do not?	 

CHARMIAN In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing. 

CLEOPATRA Thou teachest like a fool: the way to lose him. 

CHARMIAN Tempt him not so too far. I wish, forbear. In time we hate that which we often fear. 

<ACTION>Enter Antony.</ACTION> 

But here comes Antony.	 

CLEOPATRA I am sick and sullen. 

ANTONY I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose— 

CLEOPATRA Help me away, dear Charmian! I shall fall. It cannot be thus long; the sides of nature Will not sustain it.	 

ANTONY Now, my dearest queen— 

CLEOPATRA Pray you stand farther from me. 

ANTONY What’s the matter? 

CLEOPATRA I know by that same eye there’s some good news. What, says the married woman you may go?	 Would she had never given you leave to come. Let her not say ’tis I that keep you here. I have no power upon you. Hers you are. 

ANTONY The gods best know— 

CLEOPATRA O, never was there queen	 So mightily betrayed! Yet at the first I saw the treasons planted. 

ANTONY Cleopatra— 

CLEOPATRA Why should I think you can be mine, and true— Though you in swearing shake the thronèd gods—	 Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness, To be entangled with those mouth-made vows Which break themselves in swearing! 

ANTONY Most sweet queen—	 

CLEOPATRA Nay, pray you seek no color for your going, But bid farewell and go. When you sued staying, Then was the time for words. No going then! Eternity was in our lips and eyes, Bliss in our brows’ bent; none our parts so poor	 But was a race of heaven. They are so still, Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world, Art turned the greatest liar. 

ANTONY  How now, lady? 

CLEOPATRA I would I had thy inches. Thou shouldst know	 There were a heart in Egypt. 

ANTONY Hear me, queen: The strong necessity of time commands Our services awhile, but my full heart Remains in use with you. Our Italy	 Shines o’er with civil swords; Sextus Pompeius Makes his approaches to the port of Rome; Equality of two domestic powers Breed scrupulous faction; the hated grown to strength	 Are newly grown to love; the condemned Pompey, Rich in his father’s honor, creeps apace Into the hearts of such as have not thrived Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten; And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge	 By any desperate change. My more particular, And that which most with you should safe my going, Is Fulvia’s death. 

CLEOPATRA Though age from folly could not give me freedom, It does from childishness. Can Fulvia die?	 

ANTONY She’s dead, my queen.	 <ACTION>He shows her papers.</ACTION> Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read The garboils she awaked; at the last, best, See when and where she died. 

CLEOPATRA O, most false love!	 Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see, In Fulvia’s death, how mine received shall be. 

ANTONY Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know The purposes I bear, which are or cease	 As you shall give th’ advice. By the fire That quickens Nilus’ slime, I go from hence Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war As thou affects. 

CLEOPATRA Cut my lace, Charmian, come!	 But let it be; I am quickly ill and well; So Antony loves. 

ANTONY My precious queen, forbear, And give true evidence to his love, which stands An honorable trial.	 

CLEOPATRA So Fulvia told me. I prithee turn aside and weep for her, Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears Belong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene Of excellent dissembling, and let it look	 Like perfect honor. 

ANTONY You’ll heat my blood. No more! 

CLEOPATRA You can do better yet, but this is meetly. 

ANTONY Now by my sword— 

CLEOPATRA And target. Still he mends.	 But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian, How this Herculean Roman does become The carriage of his chafe. 

ANTONY I’ll leave you, lady. 

CLEOPATRA  Courteous lord, one word.	 Sir, you and I must part, but that’s not it; Sir, you and I have loved, but there’s not it; That you know well. Something it is I would— O, my oblivion is a very Antony, And I am all forgotten.	 

ANTONY But that your Royalty Holds idleness your subject, I should take you For idleness itself. 

CLEOPATRA ’Tis sweating labor To bear such idleness so near the heart	 As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me, Since my becomings kill me when they do not Eye well to you. Your honor calls you hence; Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly, And all the gods go with you. Upon your sword	 Sit laurel victory, and smooth success Be strewed before your feet. 

ANTONY Let us go. Come. Our separation so abides and flies That thou, residing here, goes yet with me,	 And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away! 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
