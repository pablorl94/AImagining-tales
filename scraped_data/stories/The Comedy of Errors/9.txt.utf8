<ACTION>Enter Antipholus of Ephesus with a Jailer, the Officer.</ACTION> 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Fear me not, man. I will not break away. I’ll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money, To warrant thee, as I am ’rested for. My wife is in a wayward mood today And will not lightly trust the messenger That I should be attached in Ephesus. I tell you, ’twill sound harshly in her ears. 

<ACTION>Enter Dromio of Ephesus with a rope’s end.</ACTION> 

Here comes my man. I think he brings the money. How now, sir? Have you that I sent you for?	 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS , <ACTION> handing over the rope’s end</ACTION> Here’s that, I warrant you, will pay them all. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS But where’s the money? 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope? 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS I’ll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.	 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS To what end did I bid thee hie thee home? 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS To a rope’s end, sir, and to that end am I returned. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS ,  <ACTION>beating Dromio</ACTION> And to that end, sir, I will welcome you. 

OFFICER Good sir, be patient.	 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS Nay, ’tis for me to be patient. I am in adversity. 

OFFICER Good now, hold thy tongue. 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.	 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Thou whoreson, senseless villain. 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel your blows. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Thou art sensible in nothing	 but blows, and so is an ass. 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long ears.—I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows.	 When I am cold, he heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me with beating. I am waked with it when I sleep, raised with it when I sit, driven out of doors with it when I go from home, welcomed home with it when I return. Nay, I bear it	 on my shoulders as a beggar wont her brat, and I think when he hath lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door. 

<ACTION>Enter Adriana, Luciana, Courtesan, and a Schoolmastercalled Pinch.</ACTION> 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Come, go along. My wife is coming yonder. 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS Mistress, respice finem, respect	 your end, or rather, the prophecy like the parrot, “Beware the rope’s end.” 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Wilt thou still talk? 

<ACTION>Beats Dromio.</ACTION> 

COURTESAN , <ACTION> to Adriana</ACTION> How say you now? Is not your husband mad? 

ADRIANA His incivility confirms no less.—	 Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer; Establish him in his true sense again, And I will please you what you will demand. 

LUCIANA Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks! 

COURTESAN Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy.	 

PINCH ,  <ACTION>to Antipholus of Ephesus</ACTION> Give me your hand, and let me feel your pulse. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS , <ACTION> striking Pinch</ACTION> There is my hand, and let it feel your ear. 

PINCH I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man, To yield possession to my holy prayers, And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight.	 I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Peace, doting wizard, peace. I am not mad. 

ADRIANA O, that thou wert not, poor distressèd soul! 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS You minion, you, are these your customers? Did this companion with the saffron face	 Revel and feast it at my house today Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut And I denied to enter in my house? 

ADRIANA O husband, God doth know you dined at home, Where would you had remained until this time,	 Free from these slanders and this open shame. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS “Dined at home”? To Dromio. Thou villain, what sayest thou? 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Were not my doors locked up and I shut out?	 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS Perdie, your doors were locked, and you shut out. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS And did not she herself revile me there? 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS Sans fable, she herself reviled you there. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Did not her kitchen maid rail, taunt, and scorn me? 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS Certes, she did; the kitchen vestal scorned you.	 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS And did not I in rage depart from thence? 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS In verity you did.—My bones bears witness, That since have felt the vigor of his rage. 

ADRIANA , <ACTION> to Pinch</ACTION> Is ’t good to soothe him in these contraries? 

PINCH It is no shame. The fellow finds his vein	 And, yielding to him, humors well his frenzy. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS , <ACTION> to Adriana</ACTION> Thou hast suborned the goldsmith to arrest me. 

ADRIANA Alas, I sent you money to redeem you By Dromio here, who came in haste for it. 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS Money by me? Heart and goodwill you might,	 But surely, master, not a rag of money. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Went’st not thou to her for a purse of ducats? 

ADRIANA He came to me, and I delivered it. 

LUCIANA And I am witness with her that she did. 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS God and the rope-maker bear me witness	 That I was sent for nothing but a rope. 

PINCH Mistress, both man and master is possessed. I know it by their pale and deadly looks. They must be bound and laid in some dark room. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS , <ACTION> to Adriana</ACTION> Say wherefore didst thou lock me forth today.	 To Dromio of Ephesus. And why dost thou deny the bag of gold? 

ADRIANA I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth. 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS And, gentle master, I received no gold. But I confess, sir, that we were locked out.	 

ADRIANA Dissembling villain, thou speak’st false in both. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all, And art confederate with a damnèd pack To make a loathsome abject scorn of me. But with these nails I’ll pluck out these false eyes	 That would behold in me this shameful sport. 

ADRIANA O bind him, bind him! Let him not come near me. 

<ACTION>Enter three or four, and offer to bind him. He strives.</ACTION> 

PINCH More company! The fiend is strong within him. 

LUCIANA Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks! 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS What, will you murder me?—Thou jailer, thou,	 I am thy prisoner. Wilt thou suffer them To make a rescue? 

OFFICER Masters, let him go. He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him. 

PINCH Go, bind this man, for he is frantic too.	 

<ACTION>Dromio is bound.</ACTION> 

ADRIANA ,  <ACTION>to Officer</ACTION> What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer? Hast thou delight to see a wretched man Do outrage and displeasure to himself? 

OFFICER He is my prisoner. If I let him go, The debt he owes will be required of me.	 

ADRIANA I will discharge thee ere I go from thee. Bear me forthwith unto his creditor, And knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.— Good Master Doctor, see him safe conveyed Home to my house. O most unhappy day!	 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS O most unhappy strumpet! 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS Master, I am here entered in bond for you. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Out on thee, villain! Wherefore dost thou mad me? 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS Will you be bound for nothing? Be mad, good master.	 Cry “The devil!” 

LUCIANA God help poor souls! How idly do they talk! 

ADRIANA ,  <ACTION>to Pinch</ACTION> Go bear him hence. 

<ACTION>Pinch and his men exit with Antipholusand Dromio of Ephesus.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Officer, Adriana, Luciana, Courtesan remain.</ACTION> 

Sister, go you with me. <ACTION>To Officer.</ACTION> Say now whose suit is he arrested at.	 

OFFICER One Angelo, a goldsmith. Do you know him? 

ADRIANA I know the man. What is the sum he owes? 

OFFICER Two hundred ducats. 

ADRIANA Say, how grows it due? 

OFFICER Due for a chain your husband had of him.	 

ADRIANA He did bespeak a chain for me but had it not. 

COURTESAN Whenas your husband all in rage today Came to my house and took away my ring, The ring I saw upon his finger now, Straight after did I meet him with a chain.	 

ADRIANA It may be so, but I did never see it.— Come, jailer, bring me where the goldsmith is. I long to know the truth hereof at large. 

<ACTION>Enter Antipholus of Syracuse with his rapier drawn,and Dromio of Syracuse.</ACTION> 

LUCIANA God for Thy mercy, they are loose again! 

ADRIANA And come with naked swords. Let’s call more help	 To have them bound again. 

OFFICER  Away! They’ll kill us. 

<ACTION>Run all out as fast as may be, frighted.Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse remain.</ACTION> 

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I see these witches are afraid of swords. 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE She that would be your wife now ran from you. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Come to the Centaur. Fetch our stuff from thence.	 I long that we were safe and sound aboard. 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Faith, stay here this night. They will surely do us no harm. You saw they speak us fair, give us gold. Methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for the mountain of mad flesh that	 claims marriage of me, I could find in my heart to stay here still, and turn witch. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I will not stay tonight for all the town. Therefore, away, to get our stuff aboard. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
