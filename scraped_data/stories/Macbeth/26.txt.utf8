<ACTION>Enter Macbeth.</ACTION> 

MACBETH They have tied me to a stake. I cannot fly, But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What’s he That was not born of woman? Such a one Am I to fear, or none. 

<ACTION>Enter young Siward.</ACTION> 

YOUNG SIWARD What is thy name?	 

MACBETH Thou ’lt be afraid to hear it. 

YOUNG SIWARD No, though thou call’st thyself a hotter name Than any is in hell. 

MACBETH My name’s Macbeth. 

YOUNG SIWARD The devil himself could not pronounce a title	 More hateful to mine ear. 

MACBETH No, nor more fearful. 

YOUNG SIWARD Thou liest, abhorrèd tyrant. With my sword I’ll prove the lie thou speak’st. 

<ACTION>They fight, and young Siward is slain.</ACTION> 

MACBETH Thou wast born of	 woman. But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn, Brandished by man that’s of a woman born. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Alarums. Enter Macduff.</ACTION> 

MACDUFF That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face! If thou beest slain, and with no stroke of mine,	 My wife and children’s ghosts will haunt me still. I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms Are hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth, Or else my sword with an unbattered edge I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;	 By this great clatter, one of greatest note Seems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune, And more I beg not.	 

<ACTION>He exits. Alarums.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Malcolm and Siward.</ACTION> 

SIWARD This way, my lord. The castle’s gently rendered. The tyrant’s people on both sides do fight,	30 The noble thanes do bravely in the war, The day almost itself professes yours, And little is to do. 

MALCOLM We have met with foes That strike beside us.	 

SIWARD  Enter, sir, the castle. 

<ACTION>They exit. Alarum.</ACTION>
