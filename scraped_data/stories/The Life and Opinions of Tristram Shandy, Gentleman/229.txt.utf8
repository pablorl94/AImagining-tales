Chapter 4.X. 

I am glad of it, said I, settling the account with myself, as I walk'd into Lyons--my chaise being all laid higgledy-piggledy with my baggage in a cart, which was moving slowly before me--I am heartily glad, said I, that 'tis all broke to pieces; for now I can go directly by water to Avignon, which will carry me on a hundred and twenty miles of my journey, and not cost me seven livres--and from thence, continued I, bringing forwards the account, I can hire a couple of mules--or asses, if I like, (for nobody knows me,) and cross the plains of Languedoc for almost nothing--I shall gain four hundred livres by the misfortune clear into my purse: and pleasure! worth--worth double the money by it. With what velocity, continued I, clapping my two hands together, shall I fly down the rapid Rhone, with the Vivares on my right hand, and Dauphiny on my left, scarce seeing the ancient cities of Vienne, Valence, and Vivieres. What a flame will it rekindle in the lamp, to snatch a blushing grape from the Hermitage and Cote roti, as I shoot by the foot of them! and what a fresh spring in the blood! 

to behold upon the banks advancing and retiring, the castles of romance, whence courteous knights have whilome rescued the distress'd--and see vertiginous, the rocks, the mountains, the cataracts, and all the hurry which Nature is in with all her great works about her.

As I went on thus, methought my chaise, the wreck of which look'd stately enough at the first, insensibly grew less and less in its size; the freshness of the painting was no more--the gilding lost its lustre--and the whole affair appeared so poor in my eyes--so sorry!--so contemptible! and, in a word, so much worse than the abbess of Andouillets' itself--that I was just opening my mouth to give it to the devil--when a pert vamping chaise-undertaker, stepping nimbly across the street, demanded if Monsieur would have his chaise refitted--No, no, said I, shaking my head sideways--Would Monsieur choose to sell it? rejoined the undertaker--With all my soul, said I--the iron work is worth forty livres--and the glasses worth forty more--and the leather you may take to live on. 

What a mine of wealth, quoth I, as he counted me the money, has this post-chaise brought me in? And this is my usual method of book-keeping, at least with the disasters of life--making a penny of every one of 'em as they happen to me-- 

--Do, my dear Jenny, tell the world for me, how I behaved under one, the most oppressive of its kind, which could befal me as a man, proud as he ought to be of his manhood-- 

'Tis enough, saidst thou, coming close up to me, as I stood with my garters in my hand, reflecting upon what had not pass'd--'Tis enough, Tristram, and I am satisfied, saidst thou, whispering these words in my ear,.......... .........;--.........--any other man would have sunk down to the centre-- 

--Every thing is good for something, quoth I. 

--I'll go into Wales for six weeks, and drink goat's whey--and I'll gain seven years longer life for the accident. For which reason I think myself inexcusable, for blaming Fortune so often as I have done, for pelting me all my life long, like an ungracious duchess, as I call'd her, with so many small evils: surely, if I have any cause to be angry with her, 'tis that she has not sent me great ones--a score of good cursed, bouncing losses, would have been as good as a pension to me. 

--One of a hundred a year, or so, is all I wish--I would not be at the plague of paying land-tax for a larger.
