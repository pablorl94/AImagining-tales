GOWER Marina thus the brothel ’scapes, and chances Into an honest house, our story says. She sings like one immortal, and she dances As goddesslike to her admirèd lays. Deep clerks she dumbs, and with her neele composes	 Nature’s own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry, That even her art sisters the natural roses. Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry, That pupils lacks she none of noble race, Who pour their bounty on her, and her gain	 She gives the cursèd bawd. Here we her place, And to her father turn our thoughts again, Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost, Where, driven before the winds, he is arrived Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast	 Suppose him now at anchor. The city strived God Neptune’s annual feast to keep, from whence Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies, His banners sable, trimmed with rich expense, And to him in his barge with fervor hies.	 In your supposing once more put your sight Of heavy Pericles. Think this his bark, Where what is done in action—more, if might— Shall be discovered. Please you sit and hark.
