SCENE X.--HARPAGON, VALÈRE. 

VAL. I will follow her, Sir, if you will allow me, and will continue the lecture I was giving her. 

HAR. Yes, do so; you will oblige me greatly. 

VAL. She ought to be kept in with a tight hand. 

HAR. Quite true, you must.... 

VAL. Do not be afraid; I believe I shall end by convincing her. 

HAR. Do so, do so. I am going to take a short stroll in the town, and I will come back again presently. 

VAL. (_going towards the door through which_ ÉLISE _left, and speaking as if it were to her_). Yes, money is more precious than anything else in the world, and you should thank heaven that you have so worthy a man for a father. He knows what life is. When a man offers to marry a girl without a dowry, we ought to look no farther. Everything is comprised in that, and "without dowry" compensates for want of beauty, youth, birth, honour, wisdom, and probity. 

HAR. Ah! the honest fellow! he speaks like an oracle. Happy is he who can secure such a servant!
