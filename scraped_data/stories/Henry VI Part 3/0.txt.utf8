<ACTION>Alarum. Enter Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York;Edward; Richard; Norfolk; Montague; Warwick; andSoldiers, all wearing the white rose.</ACTION> 

WARWICK I wonder how the King escaped our hands. 

YORK While we pursued the horsemen of the north, He slyly stole away and left his men; Whereat the great lord of Northumberland, Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,	 Cheered up the drooping army; and himself, Lord Clifford, and Lord Stafford, all abreast, Charged our main battle’s front and, breaking in, Were by the swords of common soldiers slain. 

EDWARD Lord Stafford’s father, Duke of Buckingham,	 Is either slain or wounded dangerous. I cleft his beaver with a downright blow. That this is true, father, behold his blood. 

<ACTION>He shows his bloody sword.</ACTION> 

MONTAGUE ,  <ACTION>to York,</ACTION> showing his sword And, brother, here’s the Earl of Wiltshire’s blood, Whom I encountered as the battles joined.	 

RICHARD ,  <ACTION>holding up a severed head</ACTION> Speak thou for me, and tell them what I did. 

YORK Richard hath best deserved of all my sons. But is your Grace dead, my lord of Somerset? 

NORFOLK Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt! 

RICHARD Thus do I hope to shake King Henry’s head.	 

WARWICK And so do I, victorious prince of York. Before I see thee seated in that throne Which now the house of Lancaster usurps, I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close. This is the palace of the fearful king,	 And this the regal seat. Possess it, York, For this is thine and not King Henry’s heirs’. 

YORK Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will, For hither we have broken in by force. 

NORFOLK We’ll all assist you. He that flies shall die.	 

YORK Thanks, gentle Norfolk. Stay by me, my lords.— And soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night. <ACTION>They go up onto a dais or platform.</ACTION> 

WARWICK And when the King comes, offer him no violence Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce. 

<ACTION>Soldiers exit or retire out of sight.</ACTION> 

YORK The Queen this day here holds her parliament,	 But little thinks we shall be of her council. By words or blows, here let us win our right. 

RICHARD Armed as we are, let’s stay within this house. 

WARWICK “The Bloody Parliament” shall this be called Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice Hath made us bywords to our enemies. 

YORK Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute. I mean to take possession of my right. 

WARWICK Neither the King nor he that loves him best,	 The proudest he that holds up Lancaster, Dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells. I’ll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares. Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown. 

<ACTION>York sits in the chair of state.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Flourish. Enter King Henry, Clifford, Northumberland,Westmorland, Exeter, and the rest, all wearingthe red rose.</ACTION> 

KING HENRY My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,	 Even in the chair of state! Belike he means, Backed by the power of Warwick, that false peer, To aspire unto the crown and reign as king. Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father, And thine, Lord Clifford, and you both have vowed	 revenge On him, his sons, his favorites, and his friends. 

NORTHUMBERLAND If I be not, heavens be revenged on me! 

CLIFFORD The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel. 

WESTMORLAND What, shall we suffer this? Let’s pluck him down.	 My heart for anger burns. I cannot brook it. 

KING HENRY Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmorland. 

CLIFFORD Patience is for poltroons such as he. He durst not sit there had your father lived. My gracious lord, here in the Parliament Let us assail the family of York. 

NORTHUMBERLAND Well hast thou spoken, cousin. Be it so. 

KING HENRY Ah, know you not the city favors them, And they have troops of soldiers at their beck? 

EXETER But when the Duke is slain, they’ll quickly fly. 

KING HENRY Far be the thought of this from Henry’s heart, To make a shambles of the Parliament House! Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words, and threats Shall be the war that Henry means to use.— Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne	 And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet. I am thy sovereign. 

YORK I am thine. 

EXETER For shame, come down. He made thee Duke of York.	 

YORK It was my inheritance, as the earldom was. 

EXETER Thy father was a traitor to the crown. 

WARWICK Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown In following this usurping Henry. 

CLIFFORD Whom should he follow but his natural king?	 

WARWICK True, Clifford, that’s Richard, Duke of York. 

KING HENRY , <ACTION> to York</ACTION> And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne? 

YORK It must and shall be so. Content thyself. 

WARWICK ,  <ACTION>to King Henry</ACTION> Be Duke of Lancaster. Let him be king. 

WESTMORLAND He is both king and Duke of Lancaster,	 And that the lord of Westmorland shall maintain. 

WARWICK And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget That we are those which chased you from the field And slew your fathers and, with colors spread, Marched through the city to the palace gates.	 

NORTHUMBERLAND Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief; And by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it. 

WESTMORLAND Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons, Thy kinsmen, and thy friends, I’ll have more lives Than drops of blood were in my father’s veins.	 

CLIFFORD Urge it no more, lest that, instead of words, I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger As shall revenge his death before I stir. 

WARWICK Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats! 

YORK Will you we show our title to the crown?	 If not, our swords shall plead it in the field. 

KING HENRY What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown? Thy father was as thou art, Duke of York; Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March. I am the son of Henry the Fifth,	 Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop And seized upon their towns and provinces. 

WARWICK Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all. 

KING HENRY The Lord Protector lost it and not I. When I was crowned, I was but nine months old.	 

RICHARD You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose.— Father, tear the crown from the usurper’s head. 

EDWARD Sweet father, do so. Set it on your head. 

MONTAGUE , <ACTION> to York</ACTION> Good brother, as thou lov’st and honorest arms,	 Let’s fight it out and not stand caviling thus. 

RICHARD Sound drums and trumpets, and the King will fly. 

YORK Sons, peace! 

KING HENRY Peace thou, and give King Henry leave to speak! 

WARWICK Plantagenet shall speak first. Hear him, lords,	 And be you silent and attentive too, For he that interrupts him shall not live. 

KING HENRY Think’st thou that I will leave my kingly throne, Wherein my grandsire and my father sat? No. First shall war unpeople this my realm;	 Ay, and their colors, often borne in France, And now in England to our heart’s great sorrow, Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords? My title’s good, and better far than his. 

WARWICK Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.	 

KING HENRY Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown. 

YORK ’Twas by rebellion against his king. 

KING HENRY ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> I know not what to say; my title’s weak.— Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir? 

YORK What then? 

KING HENRY An if he may, then am I lawful king; For Richard, in the view of many lords, Resigned the crown to Henry the Fourth, Whose heir my father was, and I am his. 

YORK He rose against him, being his sovereign,	 And made him to resign his crown perforce. 

WARWICK Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrained, Think you ’twere prejudicial to his crown? 

EXETER No, for he could not so resign his crown But that the next heir should succeed and reign.	 

KING HENRY Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter? 

EXETER His is the right, and therefore pardon me. 

YORK Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not? 

EXETER My conscience tells me he is lawful king. 

KING HENRY ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> All will revolt from me and turn to him. 

NORTHUMBERLAND ,  <ACTION>to York</ACTION> Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay’st, Think not that Henry shall be so deposed. 

WARWICK Deposed he shall be, in despite of all. 

NORTHUMBERLAND Thou art deceived. ’Tis not thy southern power Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,	 Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud, Can set the Duke up in despite of me. 

CLIFFORD King Henry, be thy title right or wrong, Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defense. May that ground gape and swallow me alive	 Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father. 

KING HENRY O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart! 

YORK Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.— What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords? 

WARWICK ,  <ACTION>to King Henry</ACTION> Do right unto this princely Duke of York, Or I will fill the house with armèd men, And over the chair of state, where now he sits, Write up his title with usurping blood. 

<ACTION>He stamps with his foot,and the Soldiers show themselves.</ACTION> 

KING HENRY My lord of Warwick, hear but one word: Let me for this my lifetime reign as king. 

YORK Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs, And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou liv’st. 

KING HENRY I am content. Richard Plantagenet, Enjoy the kingdom after my decease. 

CLIFFORD What wrong is this unto the Prince your son!	 

WARWICK What good is this to England and himself! 

WESTMORLAND Base, fearful, and despairing Henry! 

CLIFFORD How hast thou injured both thyself and us! 

WESTMORLAND I cannot stay to hear these articles. 

NORTHUMBERLAND Nor I.	 

CLIFFORD Come, cousin, let us tell the Queen these news. 

WESTMORLAND Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king, In whose cold blood no spark of honor bides. 

NORTHUMBERLAND Be thou a prey unto the house of York, And die in bands for this unmanly deed.	 

CLIFFORD In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome, Or live in peace abandoned and despised! 

<ACTION>Westmorland, Northumberland, Clifford,and their Soldiers exit.</ACTION> 

WARWICK Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not. 

EXETER They seek revenge and therefore will not yield. 

KING HENRY Ah, Exeter!	 

WARWICK  Why should you sigh, my lord? 

KING HENRY Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son, Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit. But be it as it may.  <ACTION>(To York.)</ACTION> I here entail The crown to thee and to thine heirs forever,	 Conditionally, that here thou take an oath To cease this civil war and, whilst I live, To honor me as thy king and sovereign, And neither by treason nor hostility To seek to put me down and reign thyself.	 

YORK This oath I willingly take and will perform. 

WARWICK Long live King Henry! Plantagenet, embrace him. 

<ACTION>York stands, and King Henry ascends the dais.</ACTION> 

KING HENRY , <ACTION> to York</ACTION> And long live thou and these thy forward sons! 

<ACTION>They embrace.</ACTION> 

YORK Now York and Lancaster are reconciled. 

EXETER Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes.	 

<ACTION>Sennet. Here they come down.</ACTION> 

YORK ,  <ACTION>to King Henry</ACTION> Farewell, my gracious lord. I’ll to my castle. 

WARWICK And I’ll keep London with my soldiers. 

NORFOLK And I to Norfolk with my followers. 

MONTAGUE And I unto the sea, from whence I came. 

<ACTION>York, Edward, Richard, Warwick, Norfolk,Montague, and their Soldiers exit.</ACTION> 

KING HENRY And I with grief and sorrow to the court.	 

<ACTION>Enter Queen Margaret, with Prince Edward.</ACTION> 

EXETER Here comes the Queen, whose looks bewray her anger. I’ll steal away. 

KING HENRY Exeter, so will I. 

<ACTION>They begin to exit.</ACTION> 

QUEEN MARGARET Nay, go not from me. I will follow thee.	 

KING HENRY Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay. 

QUEEN MARGARET Who can be patient in such extremes? Ah, wretched man, would I had died a maid And never seen thee, never borne thee son, Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father.	 Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus? Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I, Or felt that pain which I did for him once, Or nourished him as I did with my blood, Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there, Rather than have made that savage duke thine heir And disinherited thine only son. 

PRINCE EDWARD Father, you cannot disinherit me. If you be king, why should not I succeed?	 

KING HENRY Pardon me, Margaret.—Pardon me, sweet son. The Earl of Warwick and the Duke enforced me. 

QUEEN MARGARET Enforced thee? Art thou king and wilt be forced? I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch, Thou hast undone thyself, thy son, and me,	 And giv’n unto the house of York such head As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance! To entail him and his heirs unto the crown, What is it but to make thy sepulcher And creep into it far before thy time? Warwick is Chancellor and the lord of Callice; Stern Falconbridge commands the Narrow Seas; The Duke is made Protector of the realm; And yet shalt thou be safe? Such safety finds The trembling lamb environèd with wolves. Had I been there, which am a silly woman, The soldiers should have tossed me on their pikes Before I would have granted to that act. But thou preferr’st thy life before thine honor. And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself	 Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed, Until that act of Parliament be repealed Whereby my son is disinherited. The northern lords that have forsworn thy colors Will follow mine if once they see them spread; And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace And utter ruin of the house of York. Thus do I leave thee.—Come, son, let’s away. 

Our army is ready.Come, we’ll after them. 

KING HENRY Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.	 

QUEEN MARGARET Thou hast spoke too much already. Get thee gone. 

KING HENRY Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me? 

QUEEN MARGARET Ay, to be murdered by his enemies! 

PRINCE EDWARD When I return with victory from the field, I’ll see your Grace. Till then, I’ll follow her.	2 

QUEEN MARGARET Come, son, away. We may not linger thus. 

<ACTION>Queen Margaret and Prince Edward exit.</ACTION> 

KING HENRY Poor queen! How love to me and to her son Hath made her break out into terms of rage! Revenged may she be on that hateful duke, Whose haughty spirit, wingèd with desire,	 Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle Tire on the flesh of me and of my son. The loss of those three lords torments my heart. I’ll write unto them and entreat them fair. Come, cousin, you shall be the messenger.	 

EXETER And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all. 

<ACTION>Flourish. They exit.</ACTION>
