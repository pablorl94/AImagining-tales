While Harpagon is running from the room, a servant comes in and knocks into him, saying that two of Harpagon's horses have lost their shoes and can't walk. Harpagon orders to have the horses taken to the blacksmith to be re-shod.

Cl√©ante, meanwhile, says he'll take over the duties of the house and show Mariane a good time in the garden. Uh, right. A "good time" in the garden.
