<ACTION>Alarum. Offstage fight at sea. Ordnance goes off.Enter Lieutenant, Suffolk, captive and in disguise,and Others, including a Master, a Master’s Mate,Walter Whitmore, and Prisoners.</ACTION> 

LIEUTENANT The gaudy, blabbing, and remorseful day Is crept into the bosom of the sea, And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades That drag the tragic melancholy night, Who, with their drowsy, slow, and flagging wings	 Clip dead men’s graves, and from their misty jaws Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air. Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize; For, whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs, Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,	 Or with their blood stain this discolored shore.— Master, this prisoner freely give I thee.— And, thou that art his mate, make boot of this.— The other, Walter Whitmore, is thy share. 

<ACTION>Three gentlemen prisoners, including Suffolk,are handed over.</ACTION> 

FIRST GENTLEMAN What is my ransom, master? Let me know.	 

MASTER A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head. 

MATE ,  <ACTION>to the Second Gentleman</ACTION> And so much shall you give, or off goes yours. 

LIEUTENANT What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns, And bear the name and port of gentlemen?— Cut both the villains’ throats—for die you shall;	 The lives of those which we have lost in fight Be counterpoised with such a petty sum! 

FIRST GENTLEMAN I’ll give it, sir, and therefore spare my life. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN And so will I, and write home for it straight. 

WHITMORE , <ACTION> to Suffolk</ACTION> I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,	 And therefore to revenge it shalt thou die; And so should these, if I might have my will. 

LIEUTENANT Be not so rash. Take ransom; let him live. 

SUFFOLK Look on my George; I am a gentleman. Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.	 

WHITMORE And so am I. My name is Walter Whitmore. 

<ACTION>Suffolk starts.</ACTION> 

How now, why starts thou? What, doth death affright? 

SUFFOLK Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death. A cunning man did calculate my birth	 And told me that by water I should die. Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded; Thy name is Gualtier, being rightly sounded. 

WHITMORE Gualtier or Walter, which it is, I care not. Never yet did base dishonor blur our name But with our sword we wiped away the blot. Therefore, when merchantlike I sell revenge, Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defaced, And I proclaimed a coward through the world! 

SUFFOLK Stay, Whitmore, for thy prisoner is a prince,	 The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole. 

WHITMORE The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags? 

SUFFOLK Ay, but these rags are no part of the Duke. Jove sometimes went disguised, and why not I? 

LIEUTENANT But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.	 

SUFFOLK Obscure and lousy swain, King Henry’s blood, The honorable blood of Lancaster, Must not be shed by such a jaded groom. Hast thou not kissed thy hand and held my stirrup? Bareheaded plodded by my footcloth mule,	 And thought thee happy when I shook my head? How often hast thou waited at my cup, Fed from my trencher, kneeled down at the board, When I have feasted with Queen Margaret? Remember it, and let it make thee crestfall’n,	 Ay, and allay this thy abortive pride. How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood And duly waited for my coming forth? This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf, And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.	 

WHITMORE Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain? 

LIEUTENANT First let my words stab him as he hath me. 

SUFFOLK Base slave, thy words are blunt, and so art thou. 

LIEUTENANT Convey him hence, and on our longboat’s side, Strike off his head.	 

SUFFOLK Thou dar’st not for thy own. 

LIEUTENANT Yes, Pole. 

SUFFOLK Pole! 

LIEUTENANT Pole! Sir Pole! Lord! Ay, kennel, puddle, sink, whose filth and dirt	 Troubles the silver spring where England drinks! Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth For swallowing the treasure of the realm. Thy lips that kissed the Queen shall sweep the ground,	 And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphrey’s death Against the senseless winds shall grin in vain, Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again. And wedded be thou to the hags of hell For daring to affy a mighty lord Unto the daughter of a worthless king, Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem. By devilish policy art thou grown great, And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorged	 With gobbets of thy mother’s bleeding heart. By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France. The false revolting Normans thorough thee Disdain to call us lord, and Picardy Hath slain their governors, surprised our forts,	 And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home. The princely Warwick, and the Nevilles all, Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain, As hating thee, are rising up in arms. 

And now the house of York, thrust from the crown By shameful murder of a guiltless king And lofty, proud, encroaching tyranny, Burns with revenging fire, whose hopeful colors Advance our half-faced sun, striving to shine, Under the which is writ “Invitis nubibus.”	 The commons here in Kent are up in arms, And, to conclude, reproach and beggary Is crept into the palace of our king, And all by thee.—Away!Convey him hence. 

SUFFOLK O, that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder	 Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges! Small things make base men proud. This villain here, Being captain of a pinnace, threatens more Than Bargulus, the strong Illyrian pirate.	 Drones suck not eagles’ blood, but rob beehives. It is impossible that I should die By such a lowly vassal as thyself. Thy words move rage and not remorse in me. I go of message from the Queen to France.	 I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel. 

LIEUTENANT Walter. 

WHITMORE Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death. 

SUFFOLK Paene gelidus timor occupat artus. It is thee I fear.	 

WHITMORE Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee. What, are you daunted now? Now will you stoop? 

FIRST GENTLEMAN My gracious lord, entreat him; speak him fair. 

SUFFOLK Suffolk’s imperial tongue is stern and rough, Used to command, untaught to plead for favor.	 Far be it we should honor such as these With humble suit. No, rather let my head Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any Save to the God of heaven and to my king; And sooner dance upon a bloody pole	 Than stand uncovered to the vulgar groom. True nobility is exempt from fear.— More can I bear than you dare execute. 

LIEUTENANT Hale him away, and let him talk no more. 

SUFFOLK Come, soldiers, show what cruelty you can,	 That this my death may never be forgot! Great men oft die by vile bezonians: A Roman sworder and banditto slave Murdered sweet Tully; Brutus’ bastard hand Stabbed Julius Caesar; savage islanders	 Pompey the Great, and Suffolk dies by pirates. 

<ACTION>Walter Whitmore exits withSuffolk and Others.</ACTION> 

LIEUTENANT And as for these whose ransom we have set, It is our pleasure one of them depart. To Second Gentleman. Therefore come you with us, and let him go.	Lieutenant and the rest exit.   

<ACTION>The First Gentleman remains.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Walter Whitmore with the bodyand severed head of Suffolk.</ACTION> 

WHITMORE There let his head and lifeless body lie, Until the Queen his mistress bury it. 

<ACTION>Walter Whitmore exits.</ACTION> 

FIRST GENTLEMAN O, barbarous and bloody spectacle! His body will I bear unto the King. If he revenge it not, yet will his friends.	 So will the Queen, that living held him dear. 

<ACTION>He exits with the head and body.</ACTION>
