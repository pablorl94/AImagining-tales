<ACTION>Enter at one door Aeneas with a Torchbearer, atanother Paris, Deiphobus, Antenor, Diomedes andGrecians with torches.</ACTION> 

PARIS See, ho! Who is that there? 

DEIPHOBUS It is the Lord Aeneas. 

AENEAS Is the Prince there in person?— Had I so good occasion to lie long As you, Prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business Should rob my bedmate of my company. 

DIOMEDES That’s my mind too.—Good morrow, Lord Aeneas. 

PARIS A valiant Greek, Aeneas; take his hand. Witness the process of your speech, wherein You told how Diomed a whole week by days	 Did haunt you in the field. 

AENEAS Health to you, valiant sir, During all question of the gentle truce; But when I meet you armed, as black defiance As heart can think or courage execute.	 

DIOMEDES The one and other Diomed embraces. Our bloods are now in calm, and, so long, health; But when contention and occasion meet, By Jove, I’ll play the hunter for thy life With all my force, pursuit, and policy.	 

AENEAS And thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly With his face backward. In human gentleness, Welcome to Troy. Now, by Anchises’ life, Welcome indeed. By Venus’ hand I swear No man alive can love in such a sort	 The thing he means to kill more excellently. 

DIOMEDES We sympathize. Jove, let Aeneas live, If to my sword his fate be not the glory, A thousand complete courses of the sun! But in mine emulous honor let him die	 With every joint a wound and that tomorrow. 

AENEAS We know each other well. 

DIOMEDES We do, and long to know each other worse. 

PARIS This is the most despiteful gentle greeting, The noblest hateful love, that e’er I heard of.	 <ACTION>To Aeneas.</ACTION> What business, lord, so early? 

AENEAS I was sent for to the King, but why I know not. 

PARIS His purpose meets you. ’Twas to bring this Greek To Calchas’ house, and there to render him, For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid.	 Let’s have your company, or, if you please, Haste there before us.  <ACTION>(Aside to Aeneas.)</ACTION> I constantly believe— Or, rather, call my thought a certain knowledge— My brother Troilus lodges there tonight.	 Rouse him, and give him note of our approach, With the whole quality whereof. I fear We shall be much unwelcome. 

AENEAS ,  <ACTION>aside to Paris</ACTION> That I assure you. Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece	 Than Cressid borne from Troy. 

PARIS ,  <ACTION>aside to Aeneas</ACTION> There is no help. The bitter disposition of the time Will have it so.—On, lord, we’ll follow you. 

AENEAS Good morrow, all.	 

<ACTION>Aeneas exits with the Torchbearer.</ACTION> 

PARIS And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true, Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship, Who, in your thoughts, deserves fair Helen best, Myself or Menelaus? 

DIOMEDES Both alike.	 He merits well to have her that doth seek her, Not making any scruple of her soilure, With such a hell of pain and world of charge; And you as well to keep her that defend her, Not palating the taste of her dishonor,	 With such a costly loss of wealth and friends. He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up The lees and dregs of a flat tamèd piece; You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins Are pleased to breed out your inheritors.	 Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more; But he as he, the heavier for a whore. 

PARIS You are too bitter to your countrywoman. 

DIOMEDES She’s bitter to her country. Hear me, Paris: For every false drop in her bawdy veins	 A Grecian’s life hath sunk; for every scruple Of her contaminated carrion weight A Trojan hath been slain. Since she could speak, She hath not given so many good words breath As for her Greeks and Trojans suffered death.	 

PARIS Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do, Dispraise the thing that they desire to buy. But we in silence hold this virtue well: We’ll not commend that not intend to sell. Here lies our way.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
