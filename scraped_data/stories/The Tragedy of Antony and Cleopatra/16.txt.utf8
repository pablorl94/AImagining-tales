<ACTION>Enter Enobarbus and Eros.</ACTION> 

ENOBARBUS  How now, friend Eros? 

EROS There’s strange news come, sir. 

ENOBARBUS What, man? 

EROS Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.	 

ENOBARBUS This is old. What is the success? 

EROS Caesar, having made use of him in the wars ’gainst Pompey, presently denied him rivality, would not let him partake in the glory of the action; and, not resting here, accuses him of letters he had	 formerly wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal seizes him. So the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine. 

ENOBARBUS Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more, And throw between them all the food thou hast,	 They’ll grind the one the other. Where’s Antony? 

EROS He’s walking in the garden, thus, and spurns The rush that lies before him; cries “Fool Lepidus!” And threats the throat of that his officer That murdered Pompey.	 

ENOBARBUS Our great navy’s rigged. 

EROS For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius: My lord desires you presently. My news I might have told hereafter. 

ENOBARBUS ’Twill be naught,	 But let it be. Bring me to Antony. 

EROS Come, sir. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
