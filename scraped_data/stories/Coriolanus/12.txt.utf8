<ACTION>Enter seven or eight Citizens.</ACTION> 

FIRST CITIZEN Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him. 

SECOND CITIZEN We may, sir, if we will. 

THIRD CITIZEN We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a power that we have no power to do; for, if	 he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them. So, if he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is monstrous, and for the multitude to	 be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude, of the which, we being members, should bring ourselves to be monstrous members. 

FIRST CITIZEN And to make us no better thought of, a little help will serve; for once we stood up about	 the corn, he himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude. 

THIRD CITIZEN  We have been called so of many; not that our heads are some brown, some black, some abram, some bald, but that our wits are so diversely	 colored; and truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south, and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o’ th’ compass. 

SECOND CITIZEN Think you so? Which way do you	 judge my wit would fly? 

THIRD CITIZEN  Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man’s will; ’tis strongly wedged up in a blockhead. But if it were at liberty, ’twould sure southward.	 

SECOND CITIZEN  Why that way? 

THIRD CITIZEN To lose itself in a fog, where, being three parts melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return for conscience’ sake, to help to get thee a wife.	 

SECOND CITIZEN You are never without your tricks. You may, you may. 

THIRD CITIZEN Are you all resolved to give your voices? But that’s no matter; the greater part carries it. I say, if he would incline to the people, there was	 never a worthier man. 

<ACTION>Enter Coriolanus in a gown of humility, with Menenius.</ACTION> 

Here he comes, and in the gown of humility. Mark his behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and by threes. He’s to make his requests by particulars,	 wherein every one of us has a single honor in giving him our own voices with our own tongues. Therefore follow me, and I’ll direct you how you shall go by him. 

ALL Content, content.	 <ACTION>Citizens exit.</ACTION> 

MENENIUS O sir, you are not right. Have you not known The worthiest men have done ’t? 

CORIOLANUS What must I say? “I pray, sir?”—plague upon ’t! I cannot bring My tongue to such a pace. “Look, sir, my wounds!	 I got them in my country’s service when Some certain of your brethren roared and ran From th’ noise of our own drums.” 

MENENIUS O me, the gods! You must not speak of that. You must desire them	 To think upon you. 

CORIOLANUS Think upon me? Hang ’em! I would they would forget me, like the virtues Which our divines lose by ’em. 

MENENIUS You’ll mar all.	 I’ll leave you. Pray you, speak to ’em, I pray you, In wholesome manner.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

CORIOLANUS Bid them wash their faces And keep their teeth clean. 

<ACTION>Enter three of the Citizens.</ACTION> 

So, here comes a brace.—	 You know the cause, sir, of my standing here. 

THIRD CITIZEN We do, sir. Tell us what hath brought you to ’t. 

CORIOLANUS Mine own desert. 

SECOND CITIZEN Your own desert? 

CORIOLANUS Ay, but not mine own desire.	 

THIRD CITIZEN How, not your own desire? 

CORIOLANUS No, sir, ’twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging. 

THIRD CITIZEN  You must think if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you.	 

CORIOLANUS Well then, I pray, your price o’ th’ consulship? 

FIRST CITIZEN The price is to ask it kindly. 

CORIOLANUS Kindly, sir, I pray, let me ha ’t. I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in	 private.—Your good voice, sir. What say you? 

SECOND CITIZEN You shall ha ’t, worthy sir. 

CORIOLANUS A match, sir. There’s in all two worthy voices begged. I have your alms. Adieu. 

THIRD CITIZEN , <ACTION> to the other Citizens</ACTION> But this is something	 odd. 

SECOND CITIZEN  An ’twere to give again—but ’tis no matter.	 <ACTION>These citizens exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter two other Citizens.</ACTION> 

CORIOLANUS Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be consul, I have	 here the customary gown. 

FOURTH CITIZEN You have deserved nobly of your country, and you have not deserved nobly. 

CORIOLANUS Your enigma? 

FOURTH CITIZEN  You have been a scourge to her enemies;	 you have been a rod to her friends. You have not indeed loved the common people. 

CORIOLANUS You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my sworn brother, the people, to earn a	 dearer estimation of them; ’tis a condition they account gentle. And since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practice the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly. That is, sir, I will counterfeit the bewitchment	 of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you, I may be consul. 

FIFTH CITIZEN  We hope to find you our friend, and therefore give you our voices heartily.	 

FOURTH CITIZEN You have received many wounds for your country. 

CORIOLANUS I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I will make much of your voices and so trouble you no farther.	 

BOTH The gods give you joy, sir, heartily. 

<ACTION>Citizens exit.</ACTION> 

CORIOLANUS Most sweet voices! Better it is to die, better to starve, Than crave the hire which first we do deserve. Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here	 To beg of Hob and Dick that does appear Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to ’t. What custom wills, in all things should we do ’t? The dust on antique time would lie unswept And mountainous error be too highly heaped	 For truth to o’erpeer. Rather than fool it so, Let the high office and the honor go To one that would do thus. I am half through; The one part suffered, the other will I do. 

<ACTION>Enter three Citizens more.</ACTION> 

Here come more voices.—	 Your voices! For your voices I have fought; Watched for your voices; for your voices bear Of wounds two dozen odd. Battles thrice six I have seen and heard of; for your voices have Done many things, some less, some more. Your	 voices! Indeed, I would be consul. 

SIXTH CITIZEN He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man’s voice. 

SEVENTH CITIZEN Therefore let him be consul. The	 gods give him joy, and make him good friend to the people! 

ALL Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul. 

<ACTION>Citizens exit.</ACTION> 

CORIOLANUS Worthy voices! 

<ACTION>Enter Menenius, with Brutus and Sicinius.</ACTION> 

MENENIUS You have stood your limitation, and the Tribunes	 Endue you with the people’s voice. Remains That in th’ official marks invested, you Anon do meet the Senate. 

CORIOLANUS Is this done? 

SICINIUS The custom of request you have discharged.	 The people do admit you, and are summoned To meet anon upon your approbation. 

CORIOLANUS Where? At the Senate House? 

SICINIUS There, Coriolanus. 

CORIOLANUS May I change these garments?	 

SICINIUS You may, sir. 

CORIOLANUS That I’ll straight do and, knowing myself again, Repair to th’ Senate House. 

MENENIUS I’ll keep you company.—Will you along? 

BRUTUS We stay here for the people.	 

SICINIUS Fare you well. 

<ACTION>Coriolanus and Menenius exit.</ACTION> 

He has it now; and by his looks, methinks, ’Tis warm at ’s heart. 

BRUTUS With a proud heart he wore His humble weeds. Will you dismiss the people?	 

<ACTION>Enter the Plebeians.</ACTION> 

SICINIUS How now, my masters, have you chose this man? 

FIRST CITIZEN  He has our voices, sir. 

BRUTUS We pray the gods he may deserve your loves. 

SECOND CITIZEN Amen, sir. To my poor unworthy notice, He mocked us when he begged our voices.	 

THIRD CITIZEN Certainly, he flouted us downright. 

FIRST CITIZEN No, ’tis his kind of speech. He did not mock us. 

SECOND CITIZEN Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says He used us scornfully. He should have showed us His marks of merit, wounds received for ’s country.	 

SICINIUS Why, so he did, I am sure. 

ALL No, no. No man saw ’em. 

THIRD CITIZEN He said he had wounds, which he could show in private, And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,	 “I would be consul,” says he. “Agèd custom, But by your voices, will not so permit me; Your voices therefore.” When we granted that, Here was “I thank you for your voices. Thank you. Your most sweet voices! Now you have left your	 voices, I have no further with you.” Was not this mockery? 

SICINIUS Why either were you ignorant to see ’t Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness To yield your voices?	 

BRUTUS Could you not have told him As you were lessoned? When he had no power, But was a petty servant to the state, He was your enemy, ever spake against Your liberties and the charters that you bear	 I’ th’ body of the weal; and, now arriving A place of potency and sway o’ th’ state, If he should still malignantly remain Fast foe to th’ plebeii, your voices might Be curses to yourselves. You should have said	 That as his worthy deeds did claim no less Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature Would think upon you for your voices, and Translate his malice towards you into love, Standing your friendly lord.	 

SICINIUS Thus to have said, As you were fore-advised, had touched his spirit And tried his inclination; from him plucked Either his gracious promise, which you might, As cause had called you up, have held him to;	 Or else it would have galled his surly nature, Which easily endures not article Tying him to aught. So putting him to rage, You should have ta’en th’ advantage of his choler And passed him unelected.	 

BRUTUS Did you perceive He did solicit you in free contempt When he did need your loves, and do you think That his contempt shall not be bruising to you When he hath power to crush? Why, had your	 bodies No heart among you? Or had you tongues to cry Against the rectorship of judgment? 

SICINIUS Have you ere now denied the asker? And now Again, of him that did not ask but mock,	 Bestow your sued-for tongues? 

THIRD CITIZEN He’s not confirmed. We may deny him yet. 

SECOND CITIZEN  And will deny him. I’ll have five hundred voices of that sound.	 

FIRST CITIZEN I twice five hundred, and their friends to piece ’em. 

BRUTUS Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends They have chose a consul that will from them take Their liberties, make them of no more voice Than dogs that are as often beat for barking	 As therefor kept to do so. 

SICINIUS Let them assemble And, on a safer judgment, all revoke Your ignorant election. Enforce his pride And his old hate unto you. Besides, forget not	 With what contempt he wore the humble weed, How in his suit he scorned you; but your loves, Thinking upon his services, took from you Th’ apprehension of his present portance, Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion	 After the inveterate hate he bears you. 

BRUTUS Lay A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labored, No impediment between, but that you must Cast your election on him.	 

SICINIUS Say you chose him More after our commandment than as guided By your own true affections, and that your minds, Preoccupied with what you rather must do Than what you should, made you against the grain	 To voice him consul. Lay the fault on us. 

BRUTUS Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you, How youngly he began to serve his country, How long continued, and what stock he springs of, The noble house o’ th’ Martians, from whence came	 That Ancus Martius, Numa’s daughter’s son, Who after great Hostilius here was king, Of the same house Publius and Quintus were, That our best water brought by conduits hither; And Censorinus, that was so surnamed,	 And nobly namèd so, twice being censor, Was his great ancestor. 

SICINIUS One thus descended, That hath besides well in his person wrought To be set high in place, we did commend	 To your remembrances; but you have found, Scaling his present bearing with his past, That he’s your fixèd enemy, and revoke Your sudden approbation. 

BRUTUS Say you ne’er had done ’t—	 Harp on that still—but by our putting on. And presently, when you have drawn your number, Repair to th’ Capitol. 

ALL We will so. Almost all Repent in their election.	 <ACTION>Plebeians exit.  </ACTION> 

BRUTUS Let them go on. This mutiny were better put in hazard Than stay, past doubt, for greater. If, as his nature is, he fall in rage With their refusal, both observe and answer	 The vantage of his anger. 

SICINIUS To th’ Capitol, come. We will be there before the stream o’ th’ people, And this shall seem, as partly ’tis, their own, Which we have goaded onward.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
