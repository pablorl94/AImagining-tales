<ACTION>Alarum, and retreat. Enter again Cade andall his rabblement.</ACTION> 

CADE Up Fish Street! Down Saint Magnus’ Corner! Kill and knock down! Throw them into Thames! Sound a parley. What noise is this I hear? Dare any be so bold to sound retreat or parley when I command them kill?		 

<ACTION>Enter Buckingham and old Clifford with Attendants.</ACTION> 

BUCKINGHAM Ay, here they be that dare and will disturb thee. Know, Cade, we come ambassadors from the King Unto the Commons, whom thou hast misled, And here pronounce free pardon to them all That will forsake thee and go home in peace.	 

CLIFFORD What say you, countrymen? Will you relent And yield to mercy whil’st ’tis offered you, Or let a rabble lead you to your deaths? Who loves the King and will embrace his pardon, Fling up his cap and say “God save his Majesty!”	 Who hateth him and honors not his father, Henry the Fifth, that made all France to quake, Shake he his weapon at us and pass by. 

ALL God save the King! God save the King! 

<ACTION>They fling their caps in the air.</ACTION> 

CADE   What, Buckingham and Clifford, are you so brave?—And, you base peasants, do you believe him? Will you needs be hanged with your pardons about your necks? Hath my sword therefore broke through London gates, that you should leave me at the White Hart in Southwark? I thought you would never have given out these arms till you had recovered your ancient freedom. But you are all recreants and dastards, and delight to live in slavery to the nobility. Let them break your backs with burdens, take your houses over your heads, ravish	 your wives and daughters before your faces. For me, I will make shift for one, and so God’s curse light upon you all! 

ALL We’ll follow Cade! We’ll follow Cade! 

CLIFFORD Is Cade the son of Henry the Fifth,	 That thus you do exclaim you’ll go with him? Will he conduct you through the heart of France And make the meanest of you earls and dukes? Alas, he hath no home, no place to fly to, Nor knows he how to live but by the spoil,	 Unless by robbing of your friends and us. Were ’t not a shame that, whilst you live at jar, The fearful French, whom you late vanquishèd, Should make a start o’er seas and vanquish you? Methinks already in this civil broil	 I see them lording it in London streets, Crying “Villiago!” unto all they meet. Better ten thousand baseborn Cades miscarry Than you should stoop unto a Frenchman’s mercy. To France, to France, and get what you have lost!	 Spare England, for it is your native coast. Henry hath money; you are strong and manly. God on our side, doubt not of victory. 

ALL À Clifford! À Clifford! We’ll follow the King and Clifford!	 

CADE ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this multitude? The name of Henry the Fifth hales them to an hundred mischiefs and makes them leave me desolate. I see them lay their heads together to surprise me. My sword make way for	 me, for here is no staying!—In despite of the devils and hell, have through the very middest of you! And heavens and honor be witness that no want of resolution in me, but only my followers’ base and ignominious treasons, makes me betake me to my	 heels.  

<ACTION>He exits, running.</ACTION> 

BUCKINGHAM What, is he fled? Go, some, and follow him; And he that brings his head unto the King Shall have a thousand crowns for his reward. Some of them exit. Follow me, soldiers. We’ll devise a means	 To reconcile you all unto the King. <ACTION>All exit.</ACTION>
