<ACTION>Enter Adriana and Luciana.</ACTION> 

ADRIANA Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so? Might’st thou perceive austerely in his eye That he did plead in earnest, yea or no? Looked he or red or pale, or sad or merrily? What observation mad’st thou in this case	 Of his heart’s meteors tilting in his face? 

LUCIANA First he denied you had in him no right. 

ADRIANA He meant he did me none; the more my spite. 

LUCIANA Then swore he that he was a stranger here. 

ADRIANA And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.	 

LUCIANA Then pleaded I for you. 

ADRIANA And what said he? 

LUCIANA That love I begged for you he begged of me. 

ADRIANA With what persuasion did he tempt thy love? 

LUCIANA With words that in an honest suit might move.	 First he did praise my beauty, then my speech. 

ADRIANA Did’st speak him fair? 

LUCIANA Have patience, I beseech. 

ADRIANA I cannot, nor I will not hold me still. My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.	 He is deformèd, crooked, old, and sere, Ill-faced, worse-bodied, shapeless everywhere, Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind, Stigmatical in making, worse in mind. 

LUCIANA Who would be jealous, then, of such a one?	 No evil lost is wailed when it is gone. 

ADRIANA Ah, but I think him better than I say, And yet would herein others’ eyes were worse. Far from her nest the lapwing cries away. My heart prays for him, though my tongue do	 curse. 

<ACTION>Enter Dromio of Syracuse with the key.</ACTION> 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Here, go—the desk, the purse! Sweet, now make haste. 

LUCIANA How hast thou lost thy breath? 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE By running fast.	 

ADRIANA Where is thy master, Dromio? Is he well? 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE No, he’s in Tartar limbo, worse than hell. A devil in an everlasting garment hath him, One whose hard heart is buttoned up with steel; A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;	 A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff; A backfriend, a shoulder clapper, one that countermands The passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow lands; A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot	 well, One that before the judgment carries poor souls to hell. 

ADRIANA Why, man, what is the matter? 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I do not know the matter. He is ’rested on the case.	 

ADRIANA What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit. 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I know not at whose suit he is arrested well, But is in a suit of buff which ’rested him; that can I tell. Will you send him, mistress, redemption—the	 money in his desk? 

ADRIANA Go fetch it, sister.  <ACTION>Luciana exits.</ACTION> This I wonder at, That he, unknown to me, should be in debt. Tell me, was he arrested on a band? 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Not on a band, but on a stronger thing:	 A chain, a chain. Do you not hear it ring? 

ADRIANA  What, the chain? 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE No, no, the bell. ’Tis time that I were gone. It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one.		 

ADRIANA The hours come back. That did I never hear. 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE O yes, if any hour meet a sergeant, he turns back for very fear. 

ADRIANA As if time were in debt. How fondly dost thou reason!	 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Time is a very bankrout and owes more than he’s worth to season. Nay, he’s a thief too. Have you not heard men say That time comes stealing on by night and day? If he be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the	 way, Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day? 

<ACTION>Enter Luciana, with the purse.</ACTION> 

ADRIANA Go, Dromio. There’s the money. Bear it straight, And bring thy master home immediately. 

<ACTION>Dromio exits.</ACTION> 

Come, sister, I am pressed down with conceit:	 Conceit, my comfort and my injury. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
