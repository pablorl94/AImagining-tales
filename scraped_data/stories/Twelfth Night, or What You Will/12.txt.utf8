<ACTION>Enter Sebastian and Antonio.</ACTION> 

SEBASTIAN I would not by my will have troubled you, But, since you make your pleasure of your pains, I will no further chide you. 

ANTONIO I could not stay behind you. My desire, More sharp than filèd steel, did spur me forth;	 And not all love to see you, though so much As might have drawn one to a longer voyage, But jealousy what might befall your travel, Being skill-less in these parts, which to a stranger, Unguided and unfriended, often prove	 Rough and unhospitable. My willing love, The rather by these arguments of fear, Set forth in your pursuit. 

SEBASTIAN My kind Antonio, I can no other answer make but thanks,	 And thanks, and ever thanks; and oft good turns Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay. But were my worth, as is my conscience, firm, You should find better dealing. What’s to do? Shall we go see the relics of this town?	 

ANTONIO Tomorrow, sir. Best first go see your lodging. 

SEBASTIAN I am not weary, and ’tis long to night. I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes With the memorials and the things of fame That do renown this city.	25 

ANTONIO Would you’d pardon me. I do not without danger walk these streets. Once in a sea fight ’gainst the Count his galleys I did some service, of such note indeed That were I ta’en here it would scarce be answered.	 

SEBASTIAN Belike you slew great number of his people? 

ANTONIO Th’ offense is not of such a bloody nature, Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel Might well have given us bloody argument. It might have since been answered in repaying	 What we took from them, which, for traffic’s sake, Most of our city did. Only myself stood out, For which, if I be lapsèd in this place, I shall pay dear. 

SEBASTIAN Do not then walk too open.	 

ANTONIO It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here’s my purse. <ACTION>Giving him money.</ACTION> In the south suburbs, at the Elephant, Is best to lodge. I will bespeak our diet Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge	 With viewing of the town. There shall you have me. 

SEBASTIAN  Why I your purse? 

ANTONIO Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase, and your store, I think, is not for idle markets, sir.	 

SEBASTIAN I’ll be your purse-bearer and leave you For an hour. 

ANTONIO To th’ Elephant. 

SEBASTIAN I do remember. 

<ACTION>They exit in different directions.</ACTION>
