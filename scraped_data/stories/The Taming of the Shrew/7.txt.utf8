<ACTION>Enter Grumio.</ACTION> 

GRUMIO Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? Was ever man so ’rayed? Was ever man so weary? I am sent before to make a fire, and they are coming after to warm them. Now were not I a little pot and	 soon hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me. But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself. For, considering the weather, a taller man than I will take	 cold.—Holla, ho, Curtis! 

<ACTION>Enter Curtis.</ACTION> 

CURTIS Who is that calls so coldly? 

GRUMIO A piece of ice. If thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck. A fire, good Curtis!	 

CURTIS  Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio? 

GRUMIO Oh, ay, Curtis, ay, and therefore fire, fire! Cast on no water. 

CURTIS Is she so hot a shrew as she’s reported? 

GRUMIO She was, good Curtis, before this frost. But	 thou know’st winter tames man, woman, and beast, for it hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and myself, fellow Curtis. 

CURTIS  Away, you three-inch fool, I am no beast! 

GRUMIO Am I but three inches? Why, thy horn is a	 foot, and so long am I, at the least. But wilt thou make a fire? Or shall I complain on thee to our mistress, whose hand (she being now at hand) thou shalt soon feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?	 

CURTIS I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world? 

GRUMIO A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine, and therefore fire! Do thy duty, and have thy duty, for my master and mistress are almost frozen to	 death. 

CURTIS  There’s fire ready. And therefore, good Grumio, the news! 

GRUMIO  Why, “Jack boy, ho boy!” and as much news as wilt thou.	 

CURTIS Come, you are so full of cony-catching. 

GRUMIO Why, therefore fire, for I have caught extreme cold. Where’s the cook? Is supper ready, the house trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept, the servingmen in their new fustian, their white stockings,	 and every officer his wedding garment on? Be the Jacks fair within, the Jills fair without, the carpets laid, and everything in order? 

CURTIS  All ready. And therefore, I pray thee, news. 

GRUMIO First, know my horse is tired, my master and	 mistress fallen out. 

CURTIS How? 

GRUMIO  Out of their saddles into the dirt, and thereby hangs a tale. 

CURTIS Let’s ha’ t, good Grumio.	 

GRUMIO Lend thine ear. 

CURTIS Here. 

GRUMIO There!	 <ACTION>He slaps Curtis on the ear.</ACTION> 

CURTIS  This ’tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale. 

GRUMIO  And therefore ’tis called a sensible tale. And	 this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech list’ning. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress— 

CURTIS Both of one horse? 

GRUMIO  What’s that to thee?	 

CURTIS Why, a horse. 

GRUMIO Tell thou the tale! But hadst thou not crossed me, thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell, and she under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he	 left her with the horse upon her, how he beat me because her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed that never prayed before, how I cried, how the horses ran away, how her bridle was	 burst, how I lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory which now shall die in oblivion, and thou return unexperienced to thy grave. 

CURTIS By this reck’ning, he is more shrew than she. 

GRUMIO Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all	 shall find when he comes home. But what talk I of this? Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Phillip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest. Let their heads be slickly combed, their blue coats brushed, and their garters of an indifferent knit. Let them curtsy	 with their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair of my master’s horse-tail till they kiss their hands. Are they all ready? 

CURTIS They are. 

GRUMIO  Call them forth.	 

CURTIS , <ACTION> calling out</ACTION> Do you hear, ho? You must meet my master to countenance my mistress. 

GRUMIO Why, she hath a face of her own. 

CURTIS Who knows not that? 

GRUMIO Thou, it seems, that calls for company to	 countenance her. 

CURTIS I call them forth to credit her. 

GRUMIO  Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them. 

<ACTION>Enter four or five Servingmen.</ACTION> 

NATHANIEL Welcome home, Grumio. 

PHILLIP  How now, Grumio?	 

JOSEPH What, Grumio! 

NICHOLAS  Fellow Grumio! 

NATHANIEL How now, old lad? 

GRUMIO  Welcome, you!—How now, you?—What, you!—Fellow, you!—And thus much for greeting.	 Now, my spruce companions, is all ready and all things neat? 

NATHANIEL All things is ready. How near is our master? 

GRUMIO  E’en at hand, alighted by this. And therefore	 be not—Cock’s passion, silence! I hear my master. 

<ACTION>Enter Petruchio and Katherine.</ACTION> 

PETRUCHIO Where be these knaves? What, no man at door To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse? Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Phillip? 

ALL THE SERVANTS  Here! Here, sir, here, sir!	 

PETRUCHIO “Here, sir! Here, sir! Here, sir! Here, sir!” You loggerheaded and unpolished grooms. What? No attendance? No regard? No duty? Where is the foolish knave I sent before? 

GRUMIO Here, sir, as foolish as I was before.	 

PETRUCHIO You peasant swain, you whoreson malt-horse drudge! Did I not bid thee meet me in the park And bring along these rascal knaves with thee? 

GRUMIO Nathaniel’s coat, sir, was not fully made,	 And Gabriel’s pumps were all unpinked i’ th’ heel. There was no link to color Peter’s hat, And Walter’s dagger was not come from sheathing. There were none fine but Adam, Rafe, and Gregory. The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly.	 Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you. 

PETRUCHIO Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in! 

<ACTION>The Servants exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Sings.</ACTION> Where is the life that late I led? Where are those— Sit down, Kate, and welcome.	 

<ACTION>They sit at a table.</ACTION> 

Soud, soud, soud, soud! 

<ACTION>Enter Servants with supper.</ACTION> 

Why, when, I say?—Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.— Off with my boots, you rogues, you villains! When? <ACTION>Sings.	</ACTION> It was the friar of orders gray,	 As he forth walkèd on his way— 

<ACTION>Servant begins to remove Petruchio’s boots.</ACTION> 

Out, you rogue! You pluck my foot awry. Take that!	 

<ACTION>He hits the Servant.</ACTION> 

And mend the plucking of the other.— Be merry, Kate.—Some water here! What ho!	 

<ACTION>Enter one with water.</ACTION> 

Where’s my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither. 

<ACTION>A Servant exits.</ACTION> 

One, Kate, that you must kiss and be acquainted with.— Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?—	 Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.— You whoreson villain, will you let it fall? 

<ACTION>He hits the Servant.</ACTION> 

KATHERINE Patience, I pray you, ’twas a fault unwilling. 

PETRUCHIO A whoreson beetle-headed flap-eared knave!— Come, Kate, sit down. I know you have a stomach.	 Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I?— What’s this? Mutton? 

FIRST SERVANT Ay. 

PETRUCHIO  Who brought it? 

PETER I.	 

PETRUCHIO ’Tis burnt, and so is all the meat. What dogs are these? Where is the rascal cook? How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser And serve it thus to me that love it not? There, take it to you, trenchers, cups, and all!	 

<ACTION>He throws the food and dishes at them.</ACTION> 

You heedless joltheads and unmannered slaves! What, do you grumble? I’ll be with you straight. 

<ACTION>The Servants exit.</ACTION> 

KATHERINE I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet. The meat was well, if you were so contented. 

PETRUCHIO I tell thee, Kate, ’twas burnt and dried away,	 And I expressly am forbid to touch it, For it engenders choler, planteth anger, And better ’twere that both of us did fast (Since of ourselves, ourselves are choleric) Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.	 Be patient. Tomorrow ’t shall be mended, And for this night we’ll fast for company. Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Servants severally.</ACTION> 

NATHANIEL  Peter, didst ever see the like? 

PETER He kills her in her own humor.	 

<ACTION>Enter Curtis.</ACTION> 

GRUMIO Where is he? 

CURTIS  In her chamber, Making a sermon of continency to her, And rails and swears and rates, that she (poor soul) Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,	 And sits as one new-risen from a dream. Away, away, for he is coming hither! 

<ACTION>The Servants exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Petruchio.</ACTION> 

PETRUCHIO Thus have I politicly begun my reign, And ’tis my hope to end successfully. My falcon now is sharp and passing empty,	 And, till she stoop, she must not be full-gorged, For then she never looks upon her lure. Another way I have to man my haggard, To make her come and know her keeper’s call. That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites	 That bate and beat and will not be obedient. She ate no meat today, nor none shall eat. Last night she slept not, nor tonight she shall not. As with the meat, some undeservèd fault I’ll find about the making of the bed,	 And here I’ll fling the pillow, there the bolster, This way the coverlet, another way the sheets. Ay, and amid this hurly I intend That all is done in reverend care of her. And, in conclusion, she shall watch all night,	 And, if she chance to nod, I’ll rail and brawl, And with the clamor keep her still awake. This is a way to kill a wife with kindness. And thus I’ll curb her mad and headstrong humor. 

He that knows better how to tame a shrew,	 Now let him speak; ’tis charity to shew.

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
