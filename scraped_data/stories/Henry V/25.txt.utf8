CHORUS Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story That I may prompt them; and of such as have, I humbly pray them to admit th’ excuse Of time, of numbers, and due course of things, Which cannot in their huge and proper life	 Be here presented. Now we bear the King Toward Calais. Grant him there. There seen, Heave him away upon your wingèd thoughts Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach Pales in the flood with men, wives, and boys,	 Whose shouts and claps outvoice the deep-mouthed sea, Which, like a mighty whiffler ’fore the King Seems to prepare his way. So let him land, And solemnly see him set on to London. So swift a pace hath thought that even now You may imagine him upon Blackheath, Where that his lords desire him to have borne His bruisèd helmet and his bended sword Before him through the city. He forbids it, Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride, Giving full trophy, signal, and ostent Quite from himself, to God. But now behold, In the quick forge and workinghouse of thought, How London doth pour out her citizens. 

The Mayor and all his brethren in best sort, Like to the senators of th’ antique Rome, With the plebeians swarming at their heels, Go forth and fetch their conqu’ring Caesar in— As, by a lower but by loving likelihood	 Were now the general of our gracious empress, As in good time he may, from Ireland coming, Bringing rebellion broachèd on his sword, How many would the peaceful city quit To welcome him!Much more, and much more	 cause, Did they this Harry. Now in London place him (As yet the lamentation of the French Invites the King of England’s stay at home; The Emperor’s coming in behalf of France	 To order peace between them) and omit All the occurrences, whatever chanced, Till Harry’s back return again to France. There must we bring him, and myself have played The interim, by remembering you ’tis past. Then brook abridgment, and your eyes advance After your thoughts, straight back again to France.
