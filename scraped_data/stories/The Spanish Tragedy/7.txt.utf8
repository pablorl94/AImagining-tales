[The Spanish court.] 

Enter the KING OF SPAINE, PORTINGALE EMBASSADOUR, DON CIPRIAN, &c. 

KING.  Brother of Castille, to the princes loue What saies your daughter Bel-imperia? 

CIP.  Although she coy it, as becomes her kinde, And yet dissemble that she loues the prince, I doubt not, I, but she will stoope in time; And, were she froward,--which she will not be,-- Yet heerin shall she follow my aduice, Which is to loue him or forgoe my loue. 

KING.  Then, lord embassadour of Portingale, Aduise thy king to make this marriage vp For strengthening of our late-confirmed league; I know no better meanes to make vs freends. Her dowry shall be large and liberall; Besides that she is daughter and halfe heire Vnto our brother heere, Don Ciprian, And shall enioy the moitie of his land, Ile grace her marriage with an vnckles gift, And this is it:  in case the match goe forward, The tribute which you pay shalbe releast; And, if by Balthazar she haue a sonne, He shall enioy the kingdome after vs. 

EMBAS.  Ile make the motion to my soueraigne liege, And worke it if my counsaile may preuaile. 

KING.  Doe so, my lord; and, if he giue consent, I hope his presence heere will honour vs In celebration of the nuptiall day,-- And let himselfe determine of the time. 

EM.  Wilt please your Grace command me ought besid? 

KING.  Commend me to the king; and so, farewell! But wheres Prince Balthazar, to take his leaue? 

EM.  That is perfourmd alreadie, my good lord. 

KING.  Amongst the rest of what you haue in charge, The princes raunsome must not be forgot: Thats none of mine, but his that tooke him prisoner,-- And well his forwardnes deserues reward: It was Horatio, our knight-marshalls sonne. 

EM.  Betweene vs theres a price already pitcht, And shall be send with all conuenient speed. 

KING.  Then once againe farewell, my lord! 

EM.  Farwell, my lord of Castile, and the rest! 

Exit. 

KING.  Now, brother, you must make some little paines To winne faire Bel-imperia from her will; Young virgins must be ruled by their freends. The prince is amiable, and loues her well; If she neglect him and forgoe his loue, She both will wrong her owne estate and ours. Therefore, whiles I doe entertaine the prince With greatest pleasure that our court affoords, Endeauor you to winne your daughters thought. If she giue back, all this will come to naught. 

Exeunt.
