<ACTION>Enter Martius, and Titus Lartius with a Trumpet.</ACTION> 

MARTIUS See here these movers that do prize their hours At a cracked drachma. Cushions, leaden spoons,	 Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves, Ere yet the fight be done, pack up. Down with them! 

<ACTION>The Romans with spoils exit.Alarum continues still afar off.</ACTION> 

And hark, what noise the General makes! To him! There is the man of my soul’s hate, Aufidius,	 Piercing our Romans. Then, valiant Titus, take Convenient numbers to make good the city, Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste To help Cominius. 

LARTIUS Worthy sir, thou bleed’st.	 Thy exercise hath been too violent For a second course of fight. 

MARTIUS Sir, praise me not. My work hath yet not warmed me. Fare you well. The blood I drop is rather physical	20 Than dangerous to me. To Aufidius thus I will appear and fight. 

LARTIUS Now the fair goddess Fortune Fall deep in love with thee, and her great charms Misguide thy opposers’ swords! Bold gentleman,	 Prosperity be thy page! 

MARTIUS Thy friend no less Than those she placeth highest! So farewell. 

LARTIUS Thou worthiest Martius!	 <ACTION>Martius exits.</ACTION> Go sound thy trumpet in the marketplace.	 Call thither all the officers o’ th’ town, Where they shall know our mind. Away! 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
