<ACTION>Enter Prince and Poins.</ACTION> 

PRINCE Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room and lend me thy hand to laugh a little. 

POINS Where hast been, Hal? 

PRINCE  With three or four loggerheads amongst three or fourscore hogsheads. I have sounded the very	 bass string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers, and can call them all by their Christian names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. They take it already upon their salvation that though I be but Prince of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy,	 and tell me flatly I am no proud jack, like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy—by the Lord, so they call me—and when I am king of England, I shall command all the good lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep “dyeing scarlet,”	 and when you breathe in your watering, they cry “Hem!” and bid you “Play it off!” To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour that I can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life. 

I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost much	 honor that thou wert not with me in this action; but, sweet Ned—to sweeten which name of Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped even now into my hand by an underskinker, one that never spake other English in his life than “Eight shillings	 and sixpence,” and “You are welcome,” with this shrill addition, “Anon, anon, sir.—Score a pint of bastard in the Half-moon,” or so.But, Ned, to drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee, do thou stand in some by-room while I question my	 puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar, and do thou never leave calling “Francis,” that his tale to me may be nothing but “Anon.” Step aside, and I’ll show thee a precedent. 

<ACTION>Poins exits.</ACTION> 

POINS ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> Francis!	 

PRINCE  Thou art perfect. 

POINS ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> Francis! 

<ACTION>Enter Francis, the Drawer.</ACTION> 

FRANCIS  Anon, anon, sir.—Look down into the Pomgarnet, Ralph. 

PRINCE Come hither, Francis.	 

FRANCIS My lord? 

PRINCE  How long hast thou to serve, Francis? 

FRANCIS  Forsooth, five years, and as much as to— 

POINS ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> Francis! 

FRANCIS Anon, anon, sir.	 

PRINCE Five year! By ’r Lady, a long lease for the clinking of pewter! But, Francis, darest thou be so valiant as to play the coward with thy indenture, and show it a fair pair of heels, and run from it?	 

FRANCIS O Lord, sir, I’ll be sworn upon all the books in England, I could find in my heart— 

POINS ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> Francis! 

FRANCIS Anon, sir. 

PRINCE How old art thou, Francis?	 

FRANCIS Let me see. About Michaelmas next, I shall be— 

POINS ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> Francis! 

FRANCIS  Anon, sir.—Pray, stay a little, my lord. 

PRINCE Nay, but hark you, Francis, for the sugar thou	 gavest me—’twas a pennyworth, was ’t not? 

FRANCIS O Lord, I would it had been two! 

PRINCE I will give thee for it a thousand pound. Ask me when thou wilt, and thou shalt have it. 

POINS ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> Francis!	 

FRANCIS  Anon, anon. 

PRINCE Anon, Francis? No, Francis. But tomorrow, Francis; or, Francis, o’ Thursday; or indeed, Francis, when thou wilt. But, Francis— 

FRANCIS My lord?	 

PRINCE Wilt thou rob this leathern-jerkin, crystal-button, not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch— 

FRANCIS O Lord, sir, who do you mean? 

PRINCE  Why then, your brown bastard is your only	 drink, for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet will sully. In Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much. 

FRANCIS  What, sir? 

POINS ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> Francis!	 

PRINCE Away, you rogue! Dost thou not hear them call? 

<ACTION>Here they both call him. The Drawer stands amazed,not knowing which way to go.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Vintner.</ACTION> 

VINTNER What, stand’st thou still and hear’st such a calling? Look to the guests within.  <ACTION>Francis exits.</ACTION> My lord, old Sir John with half a dozen more are at	 the door. Shall I let them in? 

PRINCE  Let them alone awhile, and then open the door.  <ACTION>Vintner exits</ACTION> . Poins! 

<ACTION>Enter Poins.</ACTION> 

POINS Anon, anon, sir. 

PRINCE   Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are	 at the door. Shall we be merry? 

POINS   As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark you, what cunning match have you made with this jest of the drawer. Come, what’s the issue? 

PRINCE I am now of all humors that have showed	 themselves humors since the old days of Goodman Adam to the pupil age of this present twelve o’clock at midnight. 

<ACTION>Enter Francis, in haste.</ACTION> 

What’s o’clock, Francis? 

FRANCIS Anon, anon, sir.	 <ACTION>Francis exits.  </ACTION> 

PRINCE   That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is upstairs and downstairs, his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy’s mind, the Hotspur of the north, he that kills me	 some six or seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his hands, and says to his wife “Fie upon this quiet life! I want work.” “O my sweet Harry,” says she, “how many hast thou killed today?” “Give my roan horse a drench,” says he, and answers	 “Some fourteen,” an hour after. “A trifle, a trifle.” I prithee, call in Falstaff. I’ll play Percy, and that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his wife. “Rivo!” says the drunkard. Call in Ribs, call in Tallow.	 

<ACTION>Enter Falstaff, Gadshill, Peto, Bardolph;and Francis, with wine.</ACTION> 

POINS   Welcome, Jack. Where hast thou been? 

FALSTAFF  A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too! Marry and amen!—Give me a cup of sack, boy.—Ere I lead this life long, I’ll sew netherstocks and mend them, and foot them too. A plague	 of all cowards!—Give me a cup of sack, rogue!—Is there no virtue extant?	 <ACTION>He drinketh.</ACTION> 

PRINCE Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter—pitiful-hearted Titan!—that melted at the sweet tale of the sun’s? If thou didst, then behold	 that compound. 

FALSTAFF ,  <ACTION>to Francis</ACTION> You rogue, here’s lime in this sack too.—There is nothing but roguery to be found in villainous man, yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in it. A villainous coward! Go	 thy ways, old Jack. Die when thou wilt. If manhood, good manhood, be not forgot upon the face of the Earth, then am I a shotten herring. There lives not three good men unhanged in England, and one of them is fat and grows old, God help the while. A bad	 world, I say. I would I were a weaver. I could sing psalms, or anything. A plague of all cowards, I say still. 

PRINCE How now, woolsack, what mutter you? 

FALSTAFF A king’s son! If I do not beat thee out of thy	 kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock of wild geese, I’ll never wear hair on my face more. You, Prince of Wales! 

PRINCE Why, you whoreson round man, what’s the	 matter? 

FALSTAFF Are not you a coward? Answer me to that— and Poins there? 

POINS Zounds, you fat paunch, an you call me coward, by the Lord, I’ll stab thee.	 

FALSTAFF  I call thee coward? I’ll see thee damned ere I call thee coward, but I would give a thousand pound I could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight enough in the shoulders you care not who sees your back. Call you that backing of your	 friends? A plague upon such backing! Give me them that will face me.—Give me a cup of sack.—I am a rogue if I drunk today. 

PRINCE  O villain, thy lips are scarce wiped since thou drunk’st last.	 

FALSTAFF All is one for that.  <ACTION>(He drinketh.) </ACTION> A plague of all cowards, still say I. 

PRINCE What’s the matter? 

FALSTAFF   What’s the matter? There be four of us here have ta’en a thousand pound this day morning. 

PRINCE  Where is it, Jack, where is it? 

FALSTAFF   Where is it? Taken from us it is. A hundred upon poor four of us. 

PRINCE   What, a hundred, man? 

FALSTAFF I am a rogue if I were not at half-sword	 with a dozen of them two hours together. I have ’scaped by miracle. I am eight times thrust through the doublet, four through the hose, my buckler cut through and through, my sword hacked like a handsaw.  <ACTION>Ecce signum!</ACTION> I never dealt better since	 I was a man. All would not do. A plague of all cowards! Let them speak.  <ACTION>Pointing to Gadshill,Bardolph, and Peto.</ACTION> If they speak more or less than truth, they are villains, and the sons of darkness.	 

PRINCE Speak, sirs, how was it? 

BARDOLPH   We four set upon some dozen. 

FALSTAFF  Sixteen at least, my lord. 

BARDOLPH And bound them. 

PETO   No, no, they were not bound.	185 

FALSTAFF  You rogue, they were bound, every man of them, or I am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew. 

BARDOLPH As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us. 

FALSTAFF  And unbound the rest, and then come in the	 other. 

PRINCE  What, fought you with them all? 

FALSTAFF All? I know not what you call all, but if I fought not with fifty of them I am a bunch of radish. If there were not two- or three-and-fifty	 upon poor old Jack, then am I no two-legged creature. 

PRINCE Pray God you have not murdered some of them. 

FALSTAFF Nay, that’s past praying for. I have peppered	 two of them. Two I am sure I have paid, two rogues in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou knowest my old ward. Here I lay, and thus I bore my point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me.	 

PRINCE What, four? Thou said’st but two even now. 

FALSTAFF Four, Hal, I told thee four. 

POINS Ay, ay, he said four. 

FALSTAFF  These four came all afront, and mainly thrust at me. I made me no more ado, but took all	 their seven points in my target, thus. 

PRINCE Seven? Why there were but four even now. 

FALSTAFF  In buckram? 

POINS Ay, four in buckram suits. 

FALSTAFF Seven by these hilts, or I am a villain else.	 

PRINCE ,  <ACTION>to Poins </ACTION> Prithee, let him alone. We shall have more anon. 

FALSTAFF  Dost thou hear me, Hal? 

PRINCE Ay, and mark thee too, Jack. 

FALSTAFF Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These	 nine in buckram that I told thee of— 

PRINCE So, two more already. 

FALSTAFF Their points being broken— 

POINS   Down fell their hose. 

FALSTAFF  Began to give me ground, but I followed me close, came in foot and hand, and, with a thought, seven of the eleven I paid. 

PRINCE O monstrous! Eleven buckram men grown out of two! 

FALSTAFF But as the devil would have it, three misbegotten	 knaves in Kendal green came at my back, and let drive at me, for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst not see thy hand. 

PRINCE These lies are like their father that begets them, gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why,	 thou claybrained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou whoreson, obscene, greasy tallow-catch— 

FALSTAFF  What, art thou mad? Art thou mad? Is not the truth the truth? 

PRINCE   Why, how couldst thou know these men in	 Kendal green when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy hand? Come, tell us your reason. What sayest thou to this? 

POINS Come, your reason, Jack, your reason. 

FALSTAFF   What, upon compulsion? Zounds, an I were	 at the strappado or all the racks in the world, I would not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on compulsion? If reasons were as plentiful as blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon compulsion, I.	 

PRINCE I’ll be no longer guilty of this sin. This sanguine coward, this bed-presser, this horse-backbreaker, this huge hill of flesh— 

FALSTAFF ’Sblood, you starveling, you elfskin, you dried neat’s tongue, you bull’s pizzle, you stockfish!	255 O, for breath to utter what is like thee! You tailor’s yard, you sheath, you bowcase, you vile standing tuck— 

PRINCE Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again, and when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,	 hear me speak but this. 

POINS Mark, Jack. 

PRINCE We two saw you four set on four, and bound them and were masters of their wealth. Mark now how a plain tale shall put you down. Then did we	 two set on you four and, with a word, outfaced you from your prize, and have it, yea, and can show it you here in the house. And, Falstaff, you carried your guts away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared for mercy, and still run and roared, as	 ever I heard bull-calf. What a slave art thou to hack thy sword as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight! What trick, what device, what starting-hole canst thou now find out to hide thee from this open and apparent shame?	 

POINS Come, let’s hear, Jack. What trick hast thou now? 

FALSTAFF  By the Lord, I knew you as well as he that made you. Why, hear you, my masters, was it for me to kill the heir apparent? Should I turn upon the true prince? Why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules, but beware instinct. The lion will not touch the true prince. Instinct is a great matter. I was now a coward on instinct. I shall think the better of myself, and thee, during my life—	 I for a valiant lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord, lads, I am glad you have the money.—Hostess, clap to the doors.—Watch tonight, pray tomorrow. Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles of good fellowship come to	 you. What, shall we be merry? Shall we have a play extempore? 

PRINCE Content, and the argument shall be thy running away. 

FALSTAFF Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me.	 

<ACTION>Enter Hostess.</ACTION> 

HOSTESS O Jesu, my lord the Prince— 

PRINCE How now, my lady the hostess, what sayst thou to me? 

HOSTESS   Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at door would speak with you. He says he	 comes from your father. 

PRINCE Give him as much as will make him a royal man and send him back again to my mother. 

FALSTAFF   What manner of man is he? 

HOSTESS  An old man.	305 

FALSTAFF  What doth Gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall I give him his answer? 

PRINCE   Prithee do, Jack. 

FALSTAFF  Faith, and I’ll send him packing.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

PRINCE  Now, sirs. To Gadshill. By ’r Lady, you fought	 fair.—So did you, Peto.—So did you, Bardolph.— You are lions too. You ran away upon instinct. You will not touch the true prince. No, fie! 

BARDOLPH Faith, I ran when I saw others run. 

PRINCE Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff’s	 sword so hacked? 

PETO  Why, he hacked it with his dagger and said he would swear truth out of England but he would make you believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like.	 

BARDOLPH Yea, and to tickle our noses with speargrass to make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments with it, and swear it was the blood of true men. I did that I did not this seven year before: I blushed to hear his monstrous devices.	 

PRINCE  O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and sword on thy side, and yet thou ran’st away. What instinct hadst thou for it?	 

BARDOLPH  My lord, do you see these meteors? Do you behold these exhalations? 

PRINCE I do. 

BARDOLPH What think you they portend? 

PRINCE Hot livers and cold purses.	 

BARDOLPH Choler, my lord, if rightly taken. 

PRINCE No. If rightly taken, halter. 

<ACTION>Enter Falstaff.</ACTION> 

Here comes lean Jack. Here comes bare-bone.— How now, my sweet creature of bombast? How long is ’t ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?	 

FALSTAFF   My own knee? When I was about thy years, Hal, I was not an eagle’s talon in the waist. I could have crept into any alderman’s thumb-ring. A plague of sighing and grief! It blows a man up like a bladder. There’s villainous news abroad. Here was	 Sir John Bracy from your father. You must to the court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the north, Percy, and he of Wales that gave Amamon the bastinado, and made Lucifer cuckold, and swore the devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a	 Welsh hook—what a plague call you him? 

POINS Owen Glendower. 

FALSTAFF  Owen, Owen, the same, and his son-in-law Mortimer, and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of Scots, Douglas, that runs a-horseback	 up a hill perpendicular— 

PRINCE   He that rides at high speed, and with his pistol kills a sparrow flying. 

FALSTAFF You have hit it. 

PRINCE So did he never the sparrow.	 

FALSTAFF   Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him. He will not run. 

PRINCE  Why, what a rascal art thou then to praise him so for running? 

FALSTAFF  A-horseback, you cuckoo, but afoot he will	 not budge a foot. 

PRINCE Yes, Jack, upon instinct. 

FALSTAFF I grant you, upon instinct. Well, he is there too, and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more. Worcester is stolen away tonight. Thy father’s	 beard is turned white with the news. You may buy land now as cheap as stinking mackerel. 

PRINCE Why then, it is like if there come a hot June, and this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads as they buy hobnails, by the hundreds.	 

FALSTAFF  By the Mass, thou sayest true. It is like we shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal, art not thou horrible afeard? Thou being heir apparent, could the world pick thee out three such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that spirit	 Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou not horribly afraid? Doth not thy blood thrill at it? 

PRINCE Not a whit, i’ faith. I lack some of thy instinct. 

FALSTAFF   Well, thou wilt be horribly chid tomorrow when thou comest to thy father. If thou love me,	 practice an answer. 

PRINCE  Do thou stand for my father and examine me upon the particulars of my life. 

FALSTAFF  Shall I? Content.  <ACTION>He sits down.</ACTION> This chair shall be my state, this dagger my scepter, and this	 cushion my crown. 

PRINCE   Thy state is taken for a joined stool, thy golden scepter for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich crown for a pitiful bald crown. 

FALSTAFF Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of	 thee, now shalt thou be moved.—Give me a cup of sack to make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have wept, for I must speak in passion, and I will do it in King Cambyses’ vein. 

PRINCE ,  <ACTION>bowing</ACTION> Well, here is my leg.  	 

FALSTAFF  And here is my speech.  <ACTION>As King.</ACTION> Stand aside, nobility. 

HOSTESS O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i’ faith! 

FALSTAFF ,  <ACTION>as King</ACTION> Weep not, sweet queen, for trickling tears are vain. 

HOSTESS O the Father, how he holds his countenance!	 

FALSTAFF , <ACTION> as King</ACTION> For God’s sake, lords, convey my tristful queen, For tears do stop the floodgates of her eyes. 

HOSTESS O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry players as ever I see. 

FALSTAFF Peace, good pint-pot. Peace, good tickle-brain.—	 <ACTION>As King.</ACTION> Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time, but also how thou art accompanied. For though the camomile, the more it is trodden on, the faster it grows, so youth, the more it is wasted, the sooner it wears. That	 thou art my son I have partly thy mother’s word, partly my own opinion, but chiefly a villainous trick of thine eye and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip that doth warrant me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point: why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries? A question not to be asked. Shall the son of England prove a thief and take purses? A question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast	 often heard of, and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch. This pitch, as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth the company thou keepest. 

For, Harry, now I do not speak to thee in drink, but in tears; not in pleasure, but in passion;	 not in words only, but in woes also.And yet there is a virtuous man whom I have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name. 

PRINCE  What manner of man, an it like your Majesty? 

FALSTAFF, <ACTION>as King</ACTION> A goodly portly man, i’ faith, and a	 corpulent; of a cheerful look, a pleasing eye, and a most noble carriage, and, as I think, his age some fifty, or, by ’r Lady, inclining to threescore; and now I remember me, his name is Falstaff. If that man should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me, for, Harry,	 I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then peremptorily I speak it: there is virtue in that Falstaff; him keep with, the rest banish. And tell me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me where hast thou	 been this month? 

PRINCE   Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me, and I’ll play my father. 

FALSTAFF, <ACTION>rising </ACTION> Depose me? If thou dost it half so gravely, so majestically, both in word and matter,	 hang me up by the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter’s hare. 

PRINCE, <ACTION>sitting down</ACTION> Well, here I am set. 

FALSTAFF And here I stand.—Judge, my masters. 

PRINCE ,  <ACTION>as King</ACTION> Now, Harry, whence come you?	 

FALSTAFF ,  <ACTION>as Prince</ACTION> My noble lord, from Eastcheap. 

PRINCE ,  <ACTION>as King</ACTION> The complaints I hear of thee are grievous. 

FALSTAFF, <ACTION>as Prince </ACTION> ’Sblood, my lord, they are false. —Nay, I’ll tickle you for a young prince, i’ faith.	 

PRINCE ,  <ACTION>as King</ACTION> Swearest thou? Ungracious boy, henceforth ne’er look on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace. There is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an old fat man. A tun of man is thy companion. Why dost thou converse with that	 trunk of humors, that bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed cloakbag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly, that reverend Vice, that gray iniquity, that father ruffian,	 that vanity in years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and drink it? Wherein neat and cleanly but to carve a capon and eat it? Wherein cunning but in craft? Wherein crafty but in villainy? Wherein villainous but in all things? Wherein worthy but in	 nothing? 

FALSTAFF ,  <ACTION>as Prince</ACTION> I would your Grace would take me with you. Whom means your Grace? 

PRINCE, <ACTION>as King </ACTION> That villainous abominable misleader of youth, Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.	 

FALSTAFF ,  <ACTION>as Prince</ACTION> My lord, the man I know. 

PRINCE ,  <ACTION>as King</ACTION> I know thou dost. 

FALSTAFF, <ACTION>as Prince</ACTION> But to say I know more harm in him than in myself were to say more than I know. That he is old, the more the pity; his white hairs do	 witness it. But that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster, that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault, God help the wicked. If to be old and merry be a sin, then many an old host that I know is damned. If to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh’s	 lean kine are to be loved. No, my good lord, banish Peto, banish Bardolph, banish Poins, but for sweet Jack Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff, valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant being as he is old Jack Falstaff, banish not	 him thy Harry’s company, banish not him thy Harry’s company. Banish plump Jack, and banish all the world. 

PRINCE I do, I will. 

<ACTION>A loud knocking, and Bardolph, Hostess, andFrancis exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Bardolph running.</ACTION> 

BARDOLPH O my lord, my lord, the Sheriff with a most	 monstrous watch is at the door. 

FALSTAFF  Out, you rogue.—Play out the play. I have much to say in the behalf of that Falstaff. 

<ACTION>Enter the Hostess.</ACTION> 

HOSTESS O Jesu, my lord, my lord— 

PRINCE  Heigh, heigh, the devil rides upon a fiddlestick.	 What’s the matter? 

HOSTESS   The Sheriff and all the watch are at the door. They are come to search the house. Shall I let them in? 

FALSTAFF Dost thou hear, Hal? Never call a true piece	 of gold a counterfeit. Thou art essentially made without seeming so. 

PRINCE  And thou a natural coward without instinct. 

FALSTAFF I deny your major. If you will deny the Sheriff, so; if not, let him enter. If I become not a	 cart as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up. I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another. 

PRINCE ,  <ACTION>standing</ACTION> Go hide thee behind the arras. The rest walk up above.—Now, my masters, for a true	 face and good conscience. 

FALSTAFF  Both which I have had, but their date is out; and therefore I’ll hide me.	 <ACTION>He hides.</ACTION> 

PRINCE Call in the Sheriff. 

<ACTION>All but the Prince and Peto exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Sheriff and the Carrier.</ACTION> 

PRINCE Now, Master Sheriff, what is your will with me? 

SHERIFF First pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry Hath followed certain men unto this house. 

PRINCE What men? 

SHERIFF One of them is well known, my gracious lord. A gross fat man.	 

CARRIER  As fat as butter. 

PRINCE The man I do assure you is not here, For I myself at this time have employed him. And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee That I will by tomorrow dinner time Send him to answer thee or any man For anything he shall be charged withal. And so let me entreat you leave the house. 

SHERIFF I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.	 

PRINCE It may be so. If he have robbed these men, He shall be answerable; and so farewell. 

SHERIFF Good night, my noble lord. 

PRINCE I think it is good morrow, is it not? 

SHERIFF Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o’clock.	 

<ACTION>He exits with the Carrier.</ACTION> 

PRINCE This oily rascal is known as well as Paul’s. Go call him forth. 

PETO  Falstaff!—Fast asleep behind the arras, and snorting like a horse. 

PRINCE  Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his	 pockets.  <ACTION>(He searcheth his pocket, and findeth certainpapers.)</ACTION> What hast thou found? 

PETO Nothing but papers, my lord. 

PRINCE   Let’s see what they be. Read them. 

PETO <ACTION>reads</ACTION> Item, a capon,…2s. 2d.	 Item, sauce,…4d. Item, sack, two gallons,…5s. 8d. Item, anchovies and sack after supper,…2s. 6d. Item, bread,…ob. 

PRINCE O monstrous! But one halfpennyworth of	 bread to this intolerable deal of sack? What there is else, keep close. We’ll read it at more advantage. There let him sleep till day. I’ll to the court in the morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place shall be honorable. I’ll procure this fat rogue a	 charge of foot, and I know his death will be a march of twelve score. The money shall be paid back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in the morning, and so good morrow, Peto. 

PETO  Good morrow, good my lord.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
