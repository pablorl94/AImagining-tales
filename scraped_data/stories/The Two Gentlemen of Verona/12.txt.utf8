<ACTION>Enter certain Outlaws.</ACTION> 

FIRST OUTLAW Fellows, stand fast. I see a passenger. 

SECOND OUTLAW If there be ten, shrink not, but down with ’em. 

<ACTION>Enter Valentine and Speed.</ACTION> 

THIRD OUTLAW Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about you. If not, we’ll make you sit, and rifle you. 

SPEED , <ACTION> to Valentine</ACTION> Sir, we are undone; these are the villains	 That all the travelers do fear so much. 

VALENTINE My friends— 

FIRST OUTLAW That’s not so, sir. We are your enemies. 

SECOND OUTLAW Peace. We’ll hear him. 

THIRD OUTLAW Ay, by my beard, will we, for he is a proper man.	 

VALENTINE Then know that I have little wealth to lose. A man I am crossed with adversity; My riches are these poor habiliments, Of which, if you should here disfurnish me, You take the sum and substance that I have.	 

SECOND OUTLAW  Whither travel you? 

VALENTINE To Verona. 

FIRST OUTLAW Whence came you? 

VALENTINE  From Milan. 

THIRD OUTLAW Have you long sojourned there?	 

VALENTINE Some sixteen months, and longer might have stayed If crooked fortune had not thwarted me. 

FIRST OUTLAW What, were you banished thence? 

VALENTINE I was. 

SECOND OUTLAW For what offense?	 

VALENTINE For that which now torments me to rehearse; I killed a man, whose death I much repent, But yet I slew him manfully in fight Without false vantage or base treachery. 

FIRST OUTLAW Why, ne’er repent it if it were done so;	 But were you banished for so small a fault? 

VALENTINE I was, and held me glad of such a doom. 

SECOND OUTLAW Have you the tongues? 

VALENTINE My youthful travel therein made me happy, Or else I often had been miserable.	 

THIRD OUTLAW By the bare scalp of Robin Hood’s fat friar, This fellow were a king for our wild faction. 

FIRST OUTLAW We’ll have him.—Sirs, a word. 

<ACTION>The Outlaws step aside to talk.</ACTION> 

SPEED  Master, be one of them. It’s an honorable kind of thievery.	 

VALENTINE Peace, villain. 

SECOND OUTLAW ,  <ACTION>advancing</ACTION> Tell us this: have you anything to take to? 

VALENTINE Nothing but my fortune. 

THIRD OUTLAW Know then that some of us are gentlemen, Such as the fury of ungoverned youth Thrust from the company of awful men. Myself was from Verona banishèd For practicing to steal away a lady, An heir and near allied unto the Duke. 

SECOND OUTLAW And I from Mantua, for a gentleman	 Who, in my mood, I stabbed unto the heart. 

FIRST OUTLAW And I for such like petty crimes as these. But to the purpose: for we cite our faults That they may hold excused our lawless lives, And partly seeing you are beautified	5 With goodly shape, and by your own report A linguist, and a man of such perfection As we do in our quality much want— 

SECOND OUTLAW Indeed because you are a banished man, Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you.	 Are you content to be our general, To make a virtue of necessity And live as we do in this wilderness? 

THIRD OUTLAW What sayst thou? Wilt thou be of our consort? Say ay, and be the captain of us all;	 We’ll do thee homage and be ruled by thee, Love thee as our commander and our king. 

FIRST OUTLAW But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest. 

SECOND OUTLAW Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offered. 

VALENTINE I take your offer and will live with you,	 Provided that you do no outrages On silly women or poor passengers. 

THIRD OUTLAW No, we detest such vile base practices. Come, go with us; we’ll bring thee to our crews And show thee all the treasure we have got,	 Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
