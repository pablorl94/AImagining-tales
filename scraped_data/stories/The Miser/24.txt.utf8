SCENE IX.--HARPAGON, MARIANNE, FROSINE. 

HAR. (_to_ MARIANNE). Do not be offended, fair one, if I come to you with my glasses on. I know that your beauty is great enough to be seen with the naked eye; but, still, it is with glasses that we look at the stars, and I maintain and uphold that you are a star, the most beautiful and in the land of stars. Frosine, she does not answer, star, it seems to me, shows no joy at the sight of me. 

FRO. It is because she is still quite awe-struck, and young girls are always shy at first, and afraid of showing what they feel. 

HAR. (_to_ FROSINE). You are right. (_To_ MARIANNE) My pretty darling, there is my daughter coming to welcome you.
