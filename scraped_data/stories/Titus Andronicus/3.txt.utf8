<ACTION>Enter Aaron, alone, carrying a bag of gold.</ACTION> 

AARON He that had wit would think that I had none, To bury so much gold under a tree And never after to inherit it. Let him that thinks of me so abjectly Know that this gold must coin a stratagem	 Which, cunningly effected, will beget A very excellent piece of villainy.	 <ACTION>He hides the bag.</ACTION> And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest That have their alms out of the Empress’ chest. 

<ACTION>Enter Tamora alone to Aaron the Moor.</ACTION> 

TAMORA My lovely Aaron, wherefore look’st thou sad,	 When everything doth make a gleeful boast? The birds chant melody on every bush, The snakes lies rollèd in the cheerful sun, The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind And make a checkered shadow on the ground.	 Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit, And whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds, Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns, As if a double hunt were heard at once, Let us sit down and mark their yellowing noise.	 And after conflict such as was supposed The wand’ring prince and Dido once enjoyed When with a happy storm they were surprised, And curtained with a counsel-keeping cave, We may, each wreathèd in the other’s arms,	 Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber, Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds Be unto us as is a nurse’s song Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep. 

AARON Madam, though Venus govern your desires,	 Saturn is dominator over mine. What signifies my deadly standing eye, My silence, and my cloudy melancholy, My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls Even as an adder when she doth unroll	 To do some fatal execution? No, madam, these are no venereal signs. Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand, Blood and revenge are hammering in my head. Hark, Tamora, the empress of my soul,	 Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee, This is the day of doom for Bassianus. His Philomel must lose her tongue today, Thy sons make pillage of her chastity And wash their hands in Bassianus’ blood.	 

<ACTION>He takes out a paper.</ACTION> Seest thou this letter? Take it up, I pray thee, And give the King this fatal-plotted scroll. <ACTION>He hands her the paper.</ACTION> 

Now, question me no more. We are espied. Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty, Which dreads not yet their lives’ destruction. 

<ACTION>Enter Bassianus and Lavinia.</ACTION> 

TAMORA Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life! 

AARON No more, great empress. Bassianus comes. Be cross with him, and I’ll go fetch thy sons To back thy quarrels, whatsoe’er they be. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

BASSIANUS Who have we here? Rome’s royal empress,	 Unfurnished of her well-beseeming troop? Or is it Dian, habited like her, Who hath abandonèd her holy groves To see the general hunting in this forest? 

TAMORA Saucy controller of my private steps,	 Had I the power that some say Dian had, Thy temples should be planted presently With horns, as was Acteon’s, and the hounds Should drive upon thy new-transformèd limbs, Unmannerly intruder as thou art.	 

LAVINIA Under your patience, gentle empress, ’Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning, And to be doubted that your Moor and you Are singled forth to try experiments. Jove shield your husband from his hounds today! ’Tis pity they should take him for a stag. 

BASSIANUS Believe me, queen, your swarthy Cimmerian Doth make your honor of his body’s hue, Spotted, detested, and abominable. Why are you sequestered from all your train,	 Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed, And wandered hither to an obscure plot, Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor, If foul desire had not conducted you? 

LAVINIA And being intercepted in your sport,	 Great reason that my noble lord be rated For sauciness.—I pray you, let us hence, And let her joy her raven-colored love. This valley fits the purpose passing well. 

BASSIANUS The King my brother shall have notice of this.	85 

LAVINIA Ay, for these slips have made him noted long. Good king to be so mightily abused! 

TAMORA Why, I have patience to endure all this. 

<ACTION>Enter Chiron and Demetrius.</ACTION> 

DEMETRIUS How now, dear sovereign and our gracious mother, Why doth your Highness look so pale and wan? 

TAMORA Have I not reason, think you, to look pale? These two have ticed me hither to this place, A barren, detested vale you see it is; The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean, Overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe.	 Here never shines the sun, here nothing breeds, Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven. And when they showed me this abhorrèd pit, They told me, here at dead time of the night A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,	 Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins, Would make such fearful and confusèd cries As any mortal body hearing it Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly. No sooner had they told this hellish tale	 But straight they told me they would bind me here Unto the body of a dismal yew And leave me to this miserable death. And then they called me foul adulteress, Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms	 That ever ear did hear to such effect. And had you not by wondrous fortune come, This vengeance on me had they executed. Revenge it as you love your mother’s life, Or be you not henceforth called my children.	 

DEMETRIUS ,  <ACTION>drawing his dagger</ACTION> This is a witness that I am thy son. 

CHIRON ,  <ACTION>drawing his dagger</ACTION> And this for me, struck home to show my strength. 

<ACTION>They stab Bassianus.</ACTION> 

LAVINIA Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora, For no name fits thy nature but thy own! 

TAMORA Give me the poniard! You shall know, my boys,	 Your mother’s hand shall right your mother’s wrong. 

DEMETRIUS Stay, madam, here is more belongs to her. First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw. This minion stood upon her chastity, Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,	 And with that painted hope braves your mightiness; And shall she carry this unto her grave? 

CHIRON And if she do, I would I were an eunuch! Drag hence her husband to some secret hole, And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.	 

TAMORA But when you have the honey you desire, Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting. 

CHIRON I warrant you, madam, we will make that sure.— Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy That nice-preservèd honesty of yours.	 

LAVINIA O Tamora, thou bearest a woman’s face— 

TAMORA I will not hear her speak. Away with her. 

LAVINIA Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word. 

DEMETRIUS ,  <ACTION>to Tamora</ACTION> Listen, fair madam. Let it be your glory To see her tears, but be your heart to them	 As unrelenting flint to drops of rain. 

LAVINIA When did the tiger’s young ones teach the dam? O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee. The milk thou suck’st from her did turn to marble. Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.	 Yet every mother breeds not sons alike. <ACTION>To Chiron. </ACTION> Do thou entreat her show a woman’s pity. 

CHIRON What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard? 

LAVINIA ’Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a lark. Yet have I heard—O, could I find it now!—	 The lion, moved with pity, did endure To have his princely paws pared all away. Some say that ravens foster forlorn children, The whilst their own birds famish in their nests. O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,	 Nothing so kind, but something pitiful. 

TAMORA I know not what it means.—Away with her. 

LAVINIA O, let me teach thee! For my father’s sake, That gave thee life when well he might have slain thee, Be not obdurate; open thy deaf ears.	 

TAMORA Hadst thou in person ne’er offended me, Even for his sake am I pitiless.— Remember, boys, I poured forth tears in vain To save your brother from the sacrifice, But fierce Andronicus would not relent.	 Therefore away with her, and use her as you will; The worse to her, the better loved of me. 

LAVINIA O Tamora, be called a gentle queen, And with thine own hands kill me in this place! For ’tis not life that I have begged so long;	170 Poor I was slain when Bassianus died. 

TAMORA What begg’st thou, then? Fond woman, let me go! 

LAVINIA ’Tis present death I beg, and one thing more That womanhood denies my tongue to tell. O, keep me from their worse-than-killing lust,	175 And tumble me into some loathsome pit Where never man’s eye may behold my body. Do this, and be a charitable murderer. 

TAMORA So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee. No, let them satisfy their lust on thee.	 

DEMETRIUS , <ACTION> to Lavinia</ACTION> Away, for thou hast stayed us here too long! 

LAVINIA ,  <ACTION>to Tamora</ACTION> No grace, no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature, The blot and enemy to our general name, Confusion fall— 

CHIRON Nay, then, I’ll stop your mouth.—Bring thou her	 husband. This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him. 

<ACTION>They put Bassianus’ body in the pit andexit, carrying off Lavinia.</ACTION> 

TAMORA Farewell, my sons. See that you make her sure. Ne’er let my heart know merry cheer indeed Till all the Andronici be made away.	 Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor, And let my spleenful sons this trull deflower. 

<ACTION>She exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Aaron with two of Titus’ sons,Quintus and Martius.</ACTION> 

AARON Come on, my lords, the better foot before. Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit Where I espied the panther fast asleep.	 

QUINTUS My sight is very dull, whate’er it bodes. 

MARTIUS And mine, I promise you. Were it not for shame, Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile. 

<ACTION>He falls into the pit.</ACTION> 

QUINTUS What, art thou fallen? What subtle hole is this, Whose mouth is covered with rude-growing briers	 Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood As fresh as morning dew distilled on flowers? A very fatal place it seems to me. Speak, brother! Hast thou hurt thee with the fall? 

MARTIUS O, brother, with the dismal’st object hurt	 That ever eye with sight made heart lament! 

AARON ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Now will I fetch the King to find them here, That he thereby may have a likely guess How these were they that made away his brother. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

MARTIUS Why dost not comfort me and help me out	 From this unhallowed and bloodstainèd hole? 

QUINTUS I am surprisèd with an uncouth fear. A chilling sweat o’erruns my trembling joints. My heart suspects more than mine eye can see. 

MARTIUS To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,	 Aaron and thou look down into this den And see a fearful sight of blood and death. 

QUINTUS Aaron is gone, and my compassionate heart Will not permit mine eyes once to behold The thing whereat it trembles by surmise.	 O, tell me who it is, for ne’er till now Was I a child to fear I know not what. 

MARTIUS Lord Bassianus lies berayed in blood, All on a heap, like to a slaughtered lamb, In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.	 

QUINTUS If it be dark, how dost thou know ’tis he? 

MARTIUS Upon his bloody finger he doth wear A precious ring that lightens all this hole, Which like a taper in some monument Doth shine upon the dead man’s earthy cheeks	 And shows the ragged entrails of this pit. So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood. O, brother, help me with thy fainting hand— If fear hath made thee faint as me it hath—	 Out of this fell devouring receptacle, As hateful as Cocytus’ misty mouth. 

QUINTUS ,  <ACTION>reaching into the pit</ACTION> Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out, Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good, I may be plucked into the swallowing womb	 Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus’ grave. He pulls Martius’ hand. I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink. 

MARTIUS Nor I no strength to climb without thy help. 

QUINTUS Thy hand once more. I will not loose again Till thou art here aloft or I below.	 Thou canst not come to me. I come to thee. 

<ACTION>He falls in.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter the Emperor Saturninus, with Attendants,and Aaron the Moor.</ACTION> 

SATURNINUS Along with me! I’ll see what hole is here And what he is that now is leapt into it.— Say, who art thou that lately didst descend Into this gaping hollow of the earth?	 

MARTIUS The unhappy sons of old Andronicus, Brought hither in a most unlucky hour To find thy brother Bassianus dead. 

SATURNINUS My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest. He and his lady both are at the lodge	 Upon the north side of this pleasant chase. ’Tis not an hour since I left them there. 

MARTIUS We know not where you left them all alive, But, out alas, here have we found him dead. 

<ACTION>Enter Tamora, Titus Andronicus, and Lucius.</ACTION> 

TAMORA Where is my lord the King?	 

SATURNINUS Here, Tamora, though grieved with killing grief. 

TAMORA Where is thy brother Bassianus? 

SATURNINUS Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound. Poor Bassianus here lies murderèd. 

TAMORA Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,	 The complot of this timeless tragedy, And wonder greatly that man’s face can fold In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny. 

<ACTION>She giveth Saturnine a letter.</ACTION> 

SATURNINUS <ACTION>(reads the letter):</ACTION> <ACTION>An if we miss to meet him handsomely,Sweet huntsman—Bassianus ’tis we mean—	Do thou so much as dig the grave for him;Thou know’st our meaning. Look for thy rewardAmong the nettles at the elder treeWhich overshades the mouth of that same pitWhere we decreed to bury Bassianus.	Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.</ACTION> O Tamora, was ever heard the like? This is the pit, and this the elder tree.— Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out That should have murdered Bassianus here.	 

AARON My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold. 

SATURNINUS ,  <ACTION>to Titus</ACTION> Two of thy whelps, fell curs of bloody kind, Have here bereft my brother of his life.— Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison. There let them bide until we have devised	 Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them. 

TAMORA What, are they in this pit? O wondrous thing! How easily murder is discoverèd. 

<ACTION>Attendants pull Quintus, Martius, andthe body of Bassianus from the pit.</ACTION> 

TITUS ,  <ACTION>kneeling</ACTION> High Emperor, upon my feeble knee I beg this boon with tears not lightly shed,	 That this fell fault of my accursèd sons— Accursèd if the faults be proved in them— 

SATURNINUS If it be proved! You see it is apparent. Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you? 

TAMORA Andronicus himself did take it up.	 

TITUS I did, my lord, yet let me be their bail, For by my father’s reverend tomb I vow They shall be ready at your Highness’ will To answer their suspicion with their lives. 

SATURNINUS Thou shalt not bail them. See thou follow me.—	 Some bring the murdered body, some the murderers. Let them not speak a word. The guilt is plain. For, by my soul, were there worse end than death, That end upon them should be executed. 

TAMORA Andronicus, I will entreat the King.	 Fear not thy sons; they shall do well enough. 

TITUS ,  <ACTION>rising</ACTION> Come, Lucius, come. Stay not to talk with them. 

<ACTION>They exit, with Attendants leading Martius andQuintus and bearing the body of Bassianus.</ACTION>
