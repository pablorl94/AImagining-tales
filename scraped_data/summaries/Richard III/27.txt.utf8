Richard and Richmond are onstage together in a fierce battle.

Richmond slays Richard.

Now it's time for speeches, and the counting of the dead. George Stanley still lives, and they go over notable soldiers who have died on each side.

Stanley plucks the crown from Richard's bleeding corpse and puts it on Richmond's head.

Richmond asks that everyone be buried according to his stature, and that repentant soldiers on Richard's side be forgiven.

Finally he turns to talk of his impending marriage with Elizabeth, daughter of Queen Elizabeth and the deceased King Edward IV. As Richmond comes from the Lancastrian line, and Elizabeth is a York, their union will finally bring the red and white roses together, ending the very long Wars of the Roses.

Richmond happily declares that the time of division in England is over. He hopes they'll rule a unified and happy England under a lasting and unchallenged peace.
