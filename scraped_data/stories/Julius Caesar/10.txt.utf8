<ACTION>Enter Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus.</ACTION> 

ANTONY These many, then, shall die; their names are pricked. 

OCTAVIUS Your brother too must die. Consent you, Lepidus? 

LEPIDUS I do consent. 

OCTAVIUS Prick him down, Antony.	 

LEPIDUS Upon condition Publius shall not live, Who is your sister’s son, Mark Antony. 

ANTONY He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him. But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar’s house; Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine	 How to cut off some charge in legacies. 

LEPIDUS  What, shall I find you here? 

OCTAVIUS Or here, or at the Capitol.	 

<ACTION>Lepidus exits.</ACTION> 

ANTONY This is a slight, unmeritable man, Meet to be sent on errands. Is it fit,	 The threefold world divided, he should stand One of the three to share it? 

OCTAVIUS  So you thought him And took his voice who should be pricked to die In our black sentence and proscription.	 

ANTONY Octavius, I have seen more days than you, And, though we lay these honors on this man To ease ourselves of diverse sland’rous loads, He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold, To groan and sweat under the business,	 Either led or driven, as we point the way; And having brought our treasure where we will, Then take we down his load and turn him off (Like to the empty ass) to shake his ears And graze in commons.	 

OCTAVIUS You may do your will, But he’s a tried and valiant soldier. 

ANTONY So is my horse, Octavius, and for that I do appoint him store of provender. It is a creature that I teach to fight,	 To wind, to stop, to run directly on, His corporal motion governed by my spirit; And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so. He must be taught and trained and bid go forth— A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds	 On objects, arts, and imitations Which, out of use and staled by other men, Begin his fashion. Do not talk of him But as a property. And now, Octavius, Listen great things. Brutus and Cassius	 Are levying powers. We must straight make head. Therefore let our alliance be combined, Our best friends made, our means stretched; And let us presently go sit in council How covert matters may be best disclosed	 And open perils surest answerèd. 

OCTAVIUS Let us do so, for we are at the stake And bayed about with many enemies, And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear, Millions of mischiefs.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
