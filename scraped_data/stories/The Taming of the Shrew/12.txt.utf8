BIONDELLO Softly and swiftly, sir, for the priest is ready. 

LUCENTIO I fly, Biondello. But they may chance to need thee at home. Therefore leave us. 

<ACTION>Lucentio exits with Bianca.</ACTION> 

BIONDELLO  Nay, faith, I’ll see the church a’ your back,	 and then come back to my master’s as soon as I can.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

GREMIO I marvel Cambio comes not all this while. 

<ACTION>Enter Petruchio, Katherine, Vincentio, Grumio, withAttendants.</ACTION> 

PETRUCHIO Sir, here’s the door. This is Lucentio’s house. My father’s bears more toward the marketplace.	 Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir. 

VINCENTIO You shall not choose but drink before you go. I think I shall command your welcome here, And by all likelihood some cheer is toward. 

<ACTION>He knocks.</ACTION> 

GREMIO , <ACTION> coming forward</ACTION> They’re busy within. You were best knock louder.	 

<ACTION>Merchant looks out of the window.</ACTION> 

MERCHANT ,  <ACTION>as Vincentio</ACTION> What’s he that knocks as he would beat down the gate? 

VINCENTIO  Is Signior Lucentio within, sir? 

MERCHANT ,  <ACTION>as Vincentio</ACTION> He’s within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.	 

VINCENTIO  What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make merry withal? 

MERCHANT, <ACTION>as Vincentio </ACTION> Keep your hundred pounds to yourself. He shall need none so long as I live.	 

PETRUCHIO , <ACTION> to Vincentio</ACTION> Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.—Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances, I pray you tell Signior Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa and is here at the door to speak with him.	 

MERCHANT ,  <ACTION>as Vincentio </ACTION> Thou liest. His father is come from Padua and here looking out at the window. 

VINCENTIO Art thou his father? 

MERCHANT ,  <ACTION>as Vincentio</ACTION> Ay, sir, so his mother says,	 if I may believe her. 

PETRUCHIO ,  <ACTION>to Vincentio</ACTION> Why, how now, gentleman! Why, this is flat knavery, to take upon you another man’s name. 

MERCHANT , <ACTION> as Vincentio</ACTION> Lay hands on the villain. I	 believe he means to cosen somebody in this city under my countenance. 

<ACTION>Enter Biondello.</ACTION> 

BIONDELLO ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> I have seen them in the church together. God send ’em good shipping! But who is here? Mine old master Vincentio! Now we are	 undone and brought to nothing. 

VINCENTIO ,  <ACTION>to Biondello </ACTION> Come hither, crack-hemp. 

BIONDELLO  I hope I may choose, sir. 

VINCENTIO Come hither, you rogue! What, have you forgot me?	 

BIONDELLO  Forgot you? No, sir. I could not forget you, for I never saw you before in all my life. 

VINCENTIO What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see thy master’s father, Vincentio? 

BIONDELLO What, my old worshipful old master? Yes,	 marry, sir. See where he looks out of the window. 

VINCENTIO Is ’t so indeed?	 

<ACTION>He beats Biondello.</ACTION> 

BIONDELLO Help, help, help! Here’s a madman will murder me.	 

<ACTION>Biondello exits.</ACTION> 

MERCHANT ,  <ACTION>as Vincentio</ACTION> Help, son! Help, Signior	 Baptista!	 

<ACTION>He exits from window.</ACTION> 

PETRUCHIO  Prithee, Kate, let’s stand aside and see the end of this controversy.	 

<ACTION>They move aside.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Merchant with Servants, and Baptista andTranio disguised as Lucentio.</ACTION> 

TRANIO ,  <ACTION>as Lucentio</ACTION> Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?	 

VINCENTIO  What am I, sir? Nay, what are you, sir! O immortal gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet, a velvet hose, a scarlet cloak, and a copatain hat! O, I am undone, I am undone! While I play the good husband at home, my son and my servant spend all	 at the university. 

TRANIO ,  <ACTION>as Lucentio </ACTION> How now, what’s the matter? 

BAPTISTA What, is the man lunatic? 

TRANIO , <ACTION> as Lucentio </ACTION> Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit, but your words show you	 a madman. Why, sir, what ’cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I thank my good father, I am able to maintain it. 

VINCENTIO Thy father! O villain, he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.	 

BAPTISTA  You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir! Pray, what do you think is his name? 

VINCENTIO His name? As if I knew not his name! I have brought him up ever since he was three years old, and his name is Tranio.	 

MERCHANT , <ACTION> as Vincentio</ACTION> Away, away, mad ass! His name is Lucentio and he is mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio. 

VINCENTIO Lucentio? O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold on him, I charge you in the Duke’s name.	 O, my son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio? 

TRANIO , <ACTION> as Lucentio</ACTION> Call forth an officer. 

<ACTION>Enter an Officer.</ACTION> 

Carry this mad knave to the jail.—Father Baptista, I charge you see that he be forthcoming.	 

VINCENTIO  Carry me to the jail? 

GREMIO Stay, officer. He shall not go to prison. 

BAPTISTA  Talk not, Signior Gremio. I say he shall go to prison. 

GREMIO Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be cony-catched	 in this business. I dare swear this is the right Vincentio. 

MERCHANT ,  <ACTION>as Vincentio </ACTION> Swear, if thou dar’st. 

GREMIO Nay, I dare not swear it. 

TRANIO ,  <ACTION>as Lucentio</ACTION> Then thou wert best say that I	 am not Lucentio. 

GREMIO  Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio. 

BAPTISTA  Away with the dotard, to the jail with him. 

VINCENTIO Thus strangers may be haled and abused.— O monstrous villain!	 

<ACTION>Enter Biondello, Lucentio and Bianca.</ACTION> 

BIONDELLO O, we are spoiled, and yonder he is! Deny him, forswear him, or else we are all undone. 

<ACTION>Biondello, Tranio, and Merchantexit as fast as may be.</ACTION> 

LUCENTIO Pardon, sweet father.	 

<ACTION>Lucentio and Bianca kneel.</ACTION> 

VINCENTIO  Lives my sweet son? 

BIANCA Pardon, dear father.	 

BAPTISTA  How hast thou offended? Where is Lucentio? 

LUCENTIO Here’s Lucentio, Right son to the right Vincentio, That have by marriage made thy daughter mine	 While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne. 

GREMIO Here’s packing, with a witness, to deceive us all! 

VINCENTIO Where is that damnèd villain, Tranio, That faced and braved me in this matter so? 

BAPTISTA Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?	 

BIANCA Cambio is changed into Lucentio. 

LUCENTIO Love wrought these miracles. Bianca’s love Made me exchange my state with Tranio, While he did bear my countenance in the town, And happily I have arrivèd at the last	 Unto the wishèd haven of my bliss. What Tranio did, myself enforced him to. Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake. 

VINCENTIO I’ll slit the villain’s nose that would have sent me to the jail!	 

BAPTISTA But do you hear, sir, have you married my daughter without asking my goodwill? 

VINCENTIO  Fear not, Baptista, we will content you. Go to! But I will in to be revenged for this villainy. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

BAPTISTA And I to sound the depth of this knavery.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

LUCENTIO Look not pale, Bianca. Thy father will not frown.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION> 

GREMIO My cake is dough, but I’ll in among the rest, Out of hope of all but my share of the feast. <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

KATHERINE Husband, let’s follow to see the end of	 this ado. 

PETRUCHIO First kiss me, Kate, and we will. 

KATHERINE  What, in the midst of the street? 

PETRUCHIO  What, art thou ashamed of me? 

KATHERINE No, sir, God forbid, but ashamed to kiss.	 

PETRUCHIO Why, then, let’s home again.  <ACTION>To Grumio.</ACTION> Come, sirrah, let’s away. 

KATHERINE Nay, I will give thee a kiss.	 <ACTION>She kisses him.</ACTION> Now pray thee, love, stay. 

PETRUCHIO Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate.	 Better once than never, for never too late. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
