<ACTION>Flourish. Enter King Edward in triumph, with Richard,Clarence, and the rest, all wearing the white rose.</ACTION> 

KING EDWARD Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course, And we are graced with wreaths of victory. But in the midst of this bright-shining day, I spy a black suspicious threat’ning cloud That will encounter with our glorious sun	 Ere he attain his easeful western bed. I mean, my lords, those powers that the Queen Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast And, as we hear, march on to fight with us. 

CLARENCE A little gale will soon disperse that cloud	 And blow it to the source from whence it came; Thy very beams will dry those vapors up, For every cloud engenders not a storm. 

RICHARD The Queen is valued thirty thousand strong, And Somerset, with Oxford, fled to her.	 If she have time to breathe, be well assured Her faction will be full as strong as ours. 

KING EDWARD We are advertised by our loving friends That they do hold their course toward Tewkesbury. We having now the best at Barnet Field	 Will thither straight, for willingness rids way, And, as we march, our strength will be augmented In every county as we go along. Strike up the drum, cry “Courage!” and away. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
