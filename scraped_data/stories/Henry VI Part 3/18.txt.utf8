<ACTION>Flourish. Enter King Henry the Sixth, Clarence,Warwick, Somerset, young Henry Earl of Richmond,Oxford, Montague, all wearing the red rose,and Lieutenant of the Tower.</ACTION> 

KING HENRY Master lieutenant, now that God and friends Have shaken Edward from the regal seat And turned my captive state to liberty, My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys, At our enlargement what are thy due fees?	 

LIEUTENANT Subjects may challenge nothing of their sov’reigns, But, if an humble prayer may prevail, I then crave pardon of your Majesty. 

KING HENRY For what, lieutenant? For well using me? Nay, be thou sure I’ll well requite thy kindness,	 For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure, Ay, such a pleasure as encagèd birds Conceive when, after many moody thoughts, At last by notes of household harmony They quite forget their loss of liberty.—	 But, Warwick, after God thou sett’st me free, And chiefly, therefore, I thank God and thee. He was the author, thou the instrument. Therefore, that I may conquer Fortune’s spite By living low where Fortune cannot hurt me,	 And that the people of this blessèd land May not be punished with my thwarting stars, Warwick, although my head still wear the crown, I here resign my government to thee, For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.	 

WARWICK Your Grace hath still been famed for virtuous And now may seem as wise as virtuous By spying and avoiding Fortune’s malice, For few men rightly temper with the stars. Yet, in this one thing let me blame your Grace:	 For choosing me when Clarence is in place. 

CLARENCE No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway, To whom the heav’ns in thy nativity Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown As likely to be blest in peace and war; And therefore I yield thee my free consent. 

WARWICK And I choose Clarence only for Protector. 

KING HENRY Warwick and Clarence, give me both your hands. Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,	 That no dissension hinder government. 

<ACTION>He joins their hands.</ACTION> 

I make you both Protectors of this land, While I myself will lead a private life And in devotion spend my latter days, To sin’s rebuke and my Creator’s praise.	 

WARWICK What answers Clarence to his sovereign’s will? 

CLARENCE That he consents, if Warwick yield consent, For on thy fortune I repose myself. 

WARWICK Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content. We’ll yoke together like a double shadow To Henry’s body, and supply his place— I mean, in bearing weight of government— While he enjoys the honor and his ease. And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor	 And all his lands and goods be confiscate. 

CLARENCE What else? And that succession be determinèd. 

WARWICK Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part. 

KING HENRY But with the first of all your chief affairs Let me entreat—for I command no more—	 That Margaret your queen and my son Edward Be sent for, to return from France with speed, For till I see them here, by doubtful fear My joy of liberty is half eclipsed. 

CLARENCE It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed. 

KING HENRY My lord of Somerset, what youth is that Of whom you seem to have so tender care? 

SOMERSET My liege, it is young Henry, Earl of Richmond. 

KING HENRY , <ACTION> to Richmond</ACTION> Come hither, England’s hope. 

<ACTION>Lays his hand on Richmond’s head.</ACTION> 

If secret powers	 Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts, This pretty lad will prove our country’s bliss. His looks are full of peaceful majesty, His head by nature framed to wear a crown, His hand to wield a scepter, and himself	 Likely in time to bless a regal throne. Make much of him, my lords, for this is he Must help you more than you are hurt by me. 

<ACTION>Enter a Post.</ACTION> 

WARWICK  What news, my friend? 

POST That Edward is escapèd from your brother	 And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy. 

WARWICK Unsavory news! But how made he escape? 

POST He was conveyed by Richard, Duke of Gloucester, And the Lord Hastings, who attended him In secret ambush on the forest side	 And from the Bishop’s huntsmen rescued him, For hunting was his daily exercise. 

WARWICK My brother was too careless of his charge. But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide A salve for any sore that may betide.	 

<ACTION>All but Somerset, Richmond, and Oxford exit.</ACTION> 

SOMERSET , <ACTION> to Oxford</ACTION> My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward’s, For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help, And we shall have more wars before ’t be long. As Henry’s late presaging prophecy Did glad my heart with hope of this young	 Richmond, So doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts What may befall him, to his harm and ours. Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst, Forthwith we’ll send him hence to Brittany	 Till storms be past of civil enmity. 

OXFORD Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown, ’Tis like that Richmond, with the rest, shall down. 

SOMERSET It shall be so. He shall to Brittany. Come, therefore, let’s about it speedily.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
