<ACTION>Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman.</ACTION> 

DOCTOR I have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report. When was it she last walked? 

GENTLEWOMAN  Since his Majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown	 upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon ’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep. 

DOCTOR A great perturbation in nature, to receive at	 once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching. In this slumb’ry agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what at any time have you heard her say? 

GENTLEWOMAN  That, sir, which I will not report after	 her. 

DOCTOR You may to me, and ’tis most meet you should. 

GENTLEWOMAN  Neither to you nor anyone, having no witness to confirm my speech.	 

<ACTION>Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper.</ACTION> 

Lo you, here she comes. This is her very guise and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close. 

DOCTOR How came she by that light? 

GENTLEWOMAN Why, it stood by her. She has light by her continually. ’Tis her command.	 

DOCTOR You see her eyes are open. 

GENTLEWOMAN Ay, but their sense are shut. 

DOCTOR What is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands. 

GENTLEWOMAN  It is an accustomed action with her to	 seem thus washing her hands. I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour. 

LADY MACBETH Yet here’s a spot. 

DOCTOR Hark, she speaks. I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more	 strongly. 

LADY MACBETH Out, damned spot, out, I say! One. Two. Why then, ’tis time to do ’t. Hell is murky. Fie, my lord, fie, a soldier and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to	 account? Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him? 

DOCTOR Do you mark that? 

LADY MACBETH The Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now? What, will these hands ne’er be clean? No	 more o’ that, my lord, no more o’ that. You mar all with this starting. 

DOCTOR Go to, go to. You have known what you should not. 

GENTLEWOMAN She has spoke what she should not,	 I am sure of that. Heaven knows what she has known. 

LADY MACBETH Here’s the smell of the blood still. All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. O, O, O!	 

DOCTOR  What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged. 

GENTLEWOMAN I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body. 

DOCTOR Well, well, well.	 

GENTLEWOMAN Pray God it be, sir. 

DOCTOR This disease is beyond my practice. Yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep, who have died holily in their beds. 

LADY MACBETH  Wash your hands. Put on your nightgown.	 Look not so pale. I tell you yet again, Banquo’s buried; he cannot come out on ’s grave. 

DOCTOR Even so? 

LADY MACBETH  To bed, to bed. There’s knocking at the gate. Come, come, come, come. Give me your	 hand. What’s done cannot be undone. To bed, to bed, to bed. <ACTION>	Lady Macbeth exits.</ACTION> 

DOCTOR Will she go now to bed? 

GENTLEWOMAN  Directly. 

DOCTOR Foul whisp’rings are abroad. Unnatural deeds	 Do breed unnatural troubles. Infected minds To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets. More needs she the divine than the physician. God, God forgive us all. Look after her. Remove from her the means of all annoyance	 And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night. My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight. I think but dare not speak. 

GENTLEWOMAN Good night, good doctor. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
