<ACTION>Enter Edgar in disguise.</ACTION> 

EDGAR Yet better thus, and known to be contemned, Than still contemned and flattered. To be worst, The lowest and most dejected thing of Fortune, Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear. The lamentable change is from the best;	 The worst returns to laughter. Welcome, then, Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace. The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst Owes nothing to thy blasts. But who comes here? 

<ACTION>Enter Gloucester and an old man.</ACTION> 

My father, poorly led? World, world, O world,	 But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee, Life would not yield to age. 

OLD MAN O my good lord, I have been your tenant And your father’s tenant these fourscore years. 

GLOUCESTER Away, get thee away. Good friend, begone.	 Thy comforts can do me no good at all; Thee they may hurt. 

OLD MAN You cannot see your way. 

GLOUCESTER I have no way and therefore want no eyes. I stumbled when I saw. Full oft ’tis seen	 Our means secure us, and our mere defects Prove our commodities. O dear son Edgar, The food of thy abusèd father’s wrath, Might I but live to see thee in my touch, I’d say I had eyes again.	 

OLD MAN How now? Who’s there? 

EDGAR ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> O gods, who is ’t can say “I am at the worst”? I am worse than e’er I was. 

OLD MAN ’Tis poor mad Tom. 

EDGAR ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> And worse I may be yet. The worst is not	 So long as we can say “This is the worst.” 

OLD MAN Fellow, where goest? 

GLOUCESTER Is it a beggar-man? 

OLD MAN Madman and beggar too. 

GLOUCESTER He has some reason, else he could not beg.	 I’ th’ last night’s storm, I such a fellow saw, Which made me think a man a worm. My son Came then into my mind, and yet my mind Was then scarce friends with him. I have heard more since.	 As flies to wanton boys are we to th’ gods; They kill us for their sport. 

EDGAR ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> How should this be? Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow, Ang’ring itself and others.—Bless thee, master.	 

GLOUCESTER Is that the naked fellow? 

OLD MAN Ay, my lord. 

GLOUCESTER Then, prithee, get thee away. If for my sake Thou wilt o’ertake us hence a mile or twain I’ th’ way toward Dover, do it for ancient love,	 And bring some covering for this naked soul, Which I’ll entreat to lead me. 

OLD MAN Alack, sir, he is mad. 

GLOUCESTER ’Tis the time’s plague when madmen lead the blind. Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure.	 Above the rest, begone. 

OLD MAN I’ll bring him the best ’parel that I have, Come on ’t what will.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

GLOUCESTER Sirrah, naked fellow— 

EDGAR Poor Tom’s a-cold.  <ACTION>Aside.</ACTION> I cannot daub it further.	 

GLOUCESTER Come hither, fellow. 

EDGAR ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> And yet I must.—Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed. 

GLOUCESTER Know’st thou the way to Dover? 

EDGAR Both stile and gate, horseway and footpath. Poor Tom hath been scared out of his good wits.	 Bless thee, good man’s son, from the foul fiend. Five fiends have been in Poor Tom at once: of lust, as Obidicut; Hobbididance, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and mowing, who since possesses	 chambermaids and waiting women. So, bless thee, master. 

GLOUCESTER ,  <ACTION>giving him money</ACTION> Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens’ plagues Have humbled to all strokes. That I am wretched	 Makes thee the happier. Heavens, deal so still: Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man, That slaves your ordinance, that will not see Because he does not feel, feel your power quickly. So distribution should undo excess	 And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover? 

EDGAR Ay, master. 

GLOUCESTER There is a cliff, whose high and bending head Looks fearfully in the confinèd deep. Bring me but to the very brim of it,	 And I’ll repair the misery thou dost bear With something rich about me. From that place I shall no leading need. 

EDGAR Give me thy arm. Poor Tom shall lead thee.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
