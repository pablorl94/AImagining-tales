SCENE I.--HARPAGON, A POLICE OFFICER. 

OFF. Leave that to me. I know my business. Thank Heaven! this is not the first time I have been employed in finding out thieves; and I wish I had as many bags of a thousand francs as I have had people hanged. 

HAR. Every magistrate must take this affair in hand; and if my money is not found, I shall call justice against justice itself. 

OFF. We must take all needful steps. You say there was in that casket...? 

HAR. Ten thousand crowns in cash. 

OFF. Ten thousand crowns! 

HAR. Ten thousand crowns. 

OFF. A considerable theft. 

HAR. There is no punishment great enough for the enormity of the crime; and if it remain unpunished, the most sacred things are no longer secure. 

OFF. In what coins was that sum? 

HAR. In good louis d'or and pistoles of full weight. 

OFF. Whom do you suspect of this robbery? 

HAR. Everybody. I wish you to take into custody the whole town and suburbs. 

OFF. You must not, if you trust me, frighten anybody, but must use gentle means to collect evidence, in order afterwards to proceed with more rigour for the recovery of the sum which has been taken from you.
