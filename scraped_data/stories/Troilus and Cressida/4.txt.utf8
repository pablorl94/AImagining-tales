<ACTION>Enter Ajax and Thersites.</ACTION> 

AJAX Thersites! 

THERSITES Agamemnon—how if he had boils, full, all over, generally? 

AJAX Thersites! 

THERSITES And those boils did run? Say so. Did not the	 general run, then? Were not that a botchy core? 

AJAX Dog! 

THERSITES Then there would come some matter from him. I see none now. 

AJAX Thou bitchwolf’s son, canst thou not hear? Feel,	 then.	 <ACTION>Strikes him.</ACTION> 

THERSITES The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel beef-witted lord! 

AJAX Speak, then, thou unsalted leaven, speak. I will beat thee into handsomeness.	 

THERSITES I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness, but I think thy horse will sooner con an oration than thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst strike, canst thou? A red murrain o’ thy jade’s tricks. 

AJAX Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.	 

THERSITES Dost thou think I have no sense, thou strikest me thus? 

AJAX The proclamation! 

THERSITES Thou art proclaimed a fool, I think. 

AJAX Do not, porpentine, do not. My fingers itch.	 

THERSITES I would thou didst itch from head to foot, and I had the scratching of thee; I would make thee the loathsomest scab in Greece. When thou art forth in the incursions, thou strikest as slow as another.	 

AJAX  I say, the proclamation! 

THERSITES Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles, and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as Cerberus is at Proserpina’s beauty, ay, that thou bark’st at him.	 

AJAX Mistress Thersites! 

THERSITES Thou shouldst strike him— 

AJAX Cobloaf! 

THERSITES He would pound thee into shivers with his fist as a sailor breaks a biscuit.	 

AJAX You whoreson cur!	 <ACTION>Strikes him.</ACTION> 

THERSITES Do, do. 

AJAX Thou stool for a witch! 

THERSITES Ay, do, do, thou sodden-witted lord. Thou hast no more brain than I have in mine elbows; an	 asinego may tutor thee, thou scurvy-valiant ass. Thou art here but to thrash Trojans, and thou art bought and sold among those of any wit, like a barbarian slave. If thou use to beat me, I will begin at thy heel and tell what thou art by inches, thou	 thing of no bowels, thou. 

AJAX You dog! 

THERSITES You scurvy lord! 

AJAX You cur!	 <ACTION>Strikes him.</ACTION> 

THERSITES Mars his idiot! Do, rudeness, do, camel, do,	 do. 

<ACTION>Enter Achilles and Patroclus.</ACTION> 

ACHILLES  Why, how now, Ajax? Wherefore do you thus?—How now, Thersites? What’s the matter, man? 

THERSITES You see him there, do you?	 

ACHILLES Ay, what’s the matter? 

THERSITES Nay, look upon him. 

ACHILLES So I do. What’s the matter? 

THERSITES Nay, but regard him well. 

ACHILLES Well, why, so I do.	 

THERSITES But yet you look not well upon him, for whosomever you take him to be, he is Ajax. 

ACHILLES I know that, fool. 

THERSITES  Ay, but that fool knows not himself. 

AJAX Therefore I beat thee.	 

THERSITES Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters! His evasions have ears thus long. I have bobbed his brain more than he has beat my bones. I will buy nine sparrows for a penny, and his pia mater is not worth the ninth part of a sparrow.	 This lord, Achilles—Ajax, who wears his wit in his belly, and his guts in his head—I’ll tell you what I say of him. 

ACHILLES What? 

THERSITES I say, this Ajax—	 <ACTION>Ajax menaces him.</ACTION> 

ACHILLES  Nay, good Ajax. 

THERSITES Has not so much wit— 

ACHILLES ,  <ACTION>to Ajax</ACTION> Nay, I must hold you. 

THERSITES As will stop the eye of Helen’s needle, for whom he comes to fight.	 

ACHILLES Peace, fool! 

THERSITES I would have peace and quietness, but the fool will not—he there, that he. Look you there. 

AJAX O, thou damned cur, I shall— 

ACHILLES Will you set your wit to a fool’s?	 

THERSITES No, I warrant you. The fool’s will shame it. 

PATROCLUS Good words, Thersites. 

ACHILLES ,  <ACTION>to Ajax</ACTION> What’s the quarrel? 

AJAX I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the proclamation, and he rails upon me.	 

THERSITES I serve thee not. 

AJAX Well, go to, go to. 

THERSITES  I serve here voluntary. 

ACHILLES Your last service was suff’rance; ’twas not voluntary. No man is beaten voluntary. Ajax was	 here the voluntary, and you as under an impress. 

THERSITES E’en so. A great deal of your wit, too, lies in your sinews, or else there be liars. Hector shall have a great catch an he knock out either of your brains; he were as good crack a fusty nut with	 no kernel. 

ACHILLES What, with me too, Thersites? 

THERSITES There’s Ulysses and old Nestor—whose wit was moldy ere your grandsires had nails on their toes—yoke you like draft-oxen and make	 you plow up the wars. 

ACHILLES  What? What? 

THERSITES Yes, good sooth. To, Achilles! To, Ajax! To— 

AJAX I shall cut out your tongue. 

THERSITES ’Tis no matter. I shall speak as much as	 thou afterwards. 

PATROCLUS No more words, Thersites. Peace. 

THERSITES I will hold my peace when Achilles’ brach bids me, shall I? 

ACHILLES There’s for you, Patroclus.	 

THERSITES I will see you hanged like clodpolls ere I come any more to your tents. I will keep where there is wit stirring and leave the faction of fools. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

PATROCLUS A good riddance. 

ACHILLES ,  <ACTION>to Ajax</ACTION> Marry, this, sir, is proclaimed through all our host:	 That Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun, Will with a trumpet ’twixt our tents and Troy Tomorrow morning call some knight to arms That hath a stomach, and such a one that dare Maintain—I know not what; ’tis trash. Farewell.	 

AJAX Farewell. Who shall answer him? 

ACHILLES I know not. ’Tis put to lott’ry. Otherwise, He knew his man.	 

<ACTION>Achilles and Patroclus exit.</ACTION> 

AJAX O, meaning you? I will go learn more of it. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
