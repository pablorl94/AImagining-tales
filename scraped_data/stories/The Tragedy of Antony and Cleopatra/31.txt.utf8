<ACTION>Alarums. Enter Antony, and Scarus wounded.</ACTION> 

SCARUS O my brave emperor, this is fought indeed! Had we done so at first, we had droven them home	 With clouts about their heads. 

ANTONY Thou bleed’st apace. 

SCARUS I had a wound here that was like a T, But now ’tis made an H.	 <ACTION>Sound of retreat far off.</ACTION> 

ANTONY They do retire.	 

SCARUS We’ll beat ’em into bench-holes. I have yet Room for six scotches more. 

<ACTION>Enter Eros.</ACTION> 

EROS They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves For a fair victory. 

SCARUS Let us score their backs	 And snatch ’em up as we take hares, behind. ’Tis sport to maul a runner. 

ANTONY I will reward thee Once for thy sprightly comfort and tenfold For thy good valor. Come thee on.	 

SCARUS I’ll halt after. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
