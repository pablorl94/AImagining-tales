<ACTION>Enter two Gamekeepers,with crossbows in their hands.</ACTION> 

FIRST GAMEKEEPER Under this thick-grown brake we’ll shroud ourselves, For through this laund anon the deer will come; And in this covert will we make our stand, Culling the principal of all the deer. 

SECOND GAMEKEEPER I’ll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.	 

FIRST GAMEKEEPER That cannot be. The noise of thy crossbow Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost. Here stand we both, and aim we at the best. And for the time shall not seem tedious, I’ll tell thee what befell me on a day	 In this self place where now we mean to stand. 

SECOND GAMEKEEPER Here comes a man; let’s stay till he be past. 

<ACTION>Enter King Henry, in disguise, with a prayer book.</ACTION> 

KING HENRY From Scotland am I stol’n, even of pure love, To greet mine own land with my wishful sight. No, Harry, Harry, ’tis no land of thine!	 Thy place is filled, thy scepter wrung from thee, Thy balm washed off wherewith thou wast anointed. No bending knee will call thee Caesar now, No humble suitors press to speak for right, No, not a man comes for redress of thee;	 For how can I help them an not myself? 

FIRST GAMEKEEPER ,  <ACTION>aside to Second Gamekeeper</ACTION> Ay, here’s a deer whose skin’s a keeper’s fee. This is the quondam king. Let’s seize upon him. 

KING HENRY Let me embrace the sour adversaries, For wise men say it is the wisest course.	 

SECOND GAMEKEEPER ,  <ACTION>aside to First Gamekeeper</ACTION> Why linger we? Let us lay hands upon him. 

FIRST GAMEKEEPER ,  <ACTION>aside to Second Gamekeeper</ACTION> Forbear awhile; we’ll hear a little more. 

KING HENRY My queen and son are gone to France for aid, And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick Is thither gone to crave the French king’s sister	 To wife for Edward. If this news be true, Poor queen and son, your labor is but lost, For Warwick is a subtle orator, And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words. By this account, then, Margaret may win him,	 For she’s a woman to be pitied much. Her sighs will make a batt’ry in his breast, Her tears will pierce into a marble heart. The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn, And Nero will be tainted with remorse	 To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears. Ay, but she’s come to beg, Warwick to give; She on his left side craving aid for Henry; He on his right asking a wife for Edward. 

She weeps and says her Henry is deposed;	 He smiles and says his Edward is installed; That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more, Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong, Inferreth arguments of mighty strength, And in conclusion wins the King from her	 With promise of his sister and what else To strengthen and support King Edward’s place.O Margaret, thus ’twill be, and thou, poor soul, Art then forsaken, as thou went’st forlorn. 

SECOND GAMEKEEPER Say, what art thou that talk’st of kings and queens?	 

KING HENRY More than I seem, and less than I was born to: A man at least, for less I should not be; And men may talk of kings, and why not I? 

SECOND GAMEKEEPER Ay, but thou talk’st as if thou wert a king. 

KING HENRY Why, so I am in mind, and that’s enough.	 

SECOND GAMEKEEPER But if thou be a king, where is thy crown? 

KING HENRY My crown is in my heart, not on my head; Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones, Nor to be seen. My crown is called content; A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.	 

SECOND GAMEKEEPER Well, if you be a king crowned with content, Your crown content and you must be contented To go along with us. For, as we think, You are the king King Edward hath deposed; And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance	 Will apprehend you as his enemy. 

KING HENRY But did you never swear and break an oath? 

SECOND GAMEKEEPER No, never such an oath, nor will not now. 

KING HENRY Where did you dwell when I was King of England? 

SECOND GAMEKEEPER Here in this country, where we now remain.	 

KING HENRY I was anointed king at nine months old. My father and my grandfather were kings, And you were sworn true subjects unto me. And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths? 

FIRST GAMEKEEPER No, for we were subjects but while you were king.	 

KING HENRY Why, am I dead? Do I not breathe a man? Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear. Look as I blow this feather from my face And as the air blows it to me again, Obeying with my wind when I do blow	 And yielding to another when it blows, Commanded always by the greater gust, Such is the lightness of you common men. But do not break your oaths, for of that sin My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.	 Go where you will, the King shall be commanded, And be you kings: command, and I’ll obey. 

FIRST GAMEKEEPER We are true subjects to the King, King Edward. 

KING HENRY So would you be again to Henry If he were seated as King Edward is.	 

FIRST GAMEKEEPER We charge you in God’s name and the King’s To go with us unto the officers. 

KING HENRY In God’s name, lead. Your king’s name be obeyed, And what God will, that let your king perform. And what he will, I humbly yield unto.
