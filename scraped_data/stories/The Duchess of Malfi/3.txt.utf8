Scene III[51] 

[Enter BOSOLA, with a dark lantern] 

BOSOLA.  Sure I did hear a woman shriek:  list, ha! And the sound came, if I receiv'd it right, ]From the duchess' lodgings.  There 's some stratagem In the confining all our courtiers To their several wards:  I must have part of it; My intelligence will freeze else.  List, again! It may be 'twas the melancholy bird, Best friend of silence and of solitariness, The owl, that screamed so.--Ha! Antonio! 

[Enter ANTONIO with a candle, his sword drawn] 

ANTONIO.  I heard some noise.--Who 's there?  What art thou?  Speak. 

BOSOLA.  Antonio, put not your face nor body To such a forc'd expression of fear; I am Bosola, your friend. 

ANTONIO.                   Bosola!-- [Aside.] This mole does undermine me.--Heard you not A noise even now? 

BOSOLA.            From whence? 

ANTONIO.                         From the duchess' lodging. 

BOSOLA.  Not I:  did you? 

ANTONIO.                   I did, or else I dream'd. 

BOSOLA.  Let 's walk towards it. 

ANTONIO.                          No:  it may be 'twas But the rising of the wind. 

BOSOLA.                      Very likely. Methinks 'tis very cold, and yet you sweat: You look wildly. 

ANTONIO.          I have been setting a figure[52] For the duchess' jewels. 

BOSOLA.                   Ah, and how falls your question? Do you find it radical?[53] 

ANTONIO.                 What 's that to you? 'Tis rather to be question'd what design, When all men were commanded to their lodgings, Makes you a night-walker. 

BOSOLA.                    In sooth, I 'll tell you: Now all the court 's asleep, I thought the devil Had least to do here; I came to say my prayers; And if it do offend you I do so, You are a fine courtier. 

ANTONIO. [Aside.]         This fellow will undo me.-- You gave the duchess apricocks to-day: Pray heaven they were not poison'd! 

BOSOLA.  Poison'd! a Spanish fig For the imputation! 

ANTONIO.             Traitors are ever confident Till they are discover'd.  There were jewels stol'n too: In my conceit, none are to be suspected More than yourself. 

BOSOLA.              You are a false steward. 

ANTONIO.  Saucy slave, I 'll pull thee up by the roots. 

BOSOLA.  May be the ruin will crush you to pieces. 

ANTONIO.  You are an impudent snake indeed, sir: Are you scarce warm, and do you show your sting? You libel[54] well, sir? 

BOSOLA.                   No, sir:  copy it out, And I will set my hand to 't. 

ANTONIO. [Aside.]              My nose bleeds. One that were superstitious would count This ominous, when it merely comes by chance. Two letters, that are wrought here for my name,[55] Are drown'd in blood! Mere accident.--For you, sir, I 'll take order I' the morn you shall be safe.--[Aside.] 'Tis that must colour Her lying-in.--Sir, this door you pass not: I do not hold it fit that you come near The duchess' lodgings, till you have quit yourself.-- [Aside.] The great are like the base, nay, they are the same, When they seek shameful ways to avoid shame. Exit. 

BOSOLA.  Antonio hereabout did drop a paper:-- Some of your help, false friend.[56]--O, here it is. What 's here? a child's nativity calculated! [Reads.] 'The duchess was deliver'd of a son, 'tween the hours twelve and one in the night, Anno Dom. 1504,'--that 's this year--'decimo nono Decembris,'--that 's this night-- 'taken according to the meridian of Malfi,'--that 's our duchess:  happy discovery!--'The lord of the first house being combust in the ascendant, signifies short life; and Mars being in a human sign, joined to the tail of the Dragon, in the eighth house, doth threaten a violent death. Caetera non scrutantur.'[57] 

Why, now 'tis most apparent; this precise fellow Is the duchess' bawd:--I have it to my wish! This is a parcel of intelligency[58] Our courtiers were cas'd up for:  it needs must follow That I must be committed on pretence Of poisoning her; which I 'll endure, and laugh at. If one could find the father now! but that Time will discover.  Old Castruccio I' th' morning posts to Rome:  by him I 'll send A letter that shall make her brothers' galls O'erflow their livers.  This was a thrifty[59] way! Though lust do mask in ne'er so strange disguise, She 's oft found witty, but is never wise. [Exit.]
