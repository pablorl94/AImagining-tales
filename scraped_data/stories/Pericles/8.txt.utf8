<ACTION>Enter the King Simonides, Thaisa, Marshal, Ladies,Lords, Attendants, and Knights in armor, from tilting.</ACTION> 

SIMONIDES Knights, To say you’re welcome were superfluous. To place upon the volume of your deeds, As in a title page, your worth in arms Were more than you expect or more than ’s fit,	5 Since every worth in show commends itself. Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast. You are princes and my guests. 

THAISA ,  <ACTION>to Pericles  </ACTION> But you my knight and guest, To whom this wreath of victory I give	 And crown you king of this day’s happiness. 

<ACTION>She places a wreath on Pericles’ head.</ACTION> 

PERICLES ’Tis more by fortune, lady, than my merit. 

SIMONIDES Call it by what you will, the day is yours, And here, I hope, is none that envies it. In framing an artist, Art hath thus decreed,	 To make some good but others to exceed, And you are her labored scholar.—Come, queen o’ the feast, For, daughter, so you are; here, take your place.— Marshal, the rest as they deserve their grace.	 

KNIGHTS We are honored much by good Simonides. 

SIMONIDES Your presence glads our days. Honor we love, For who hates honor hates the gods above. 

MARSHAL , <ACTION> to Pericles</ACTION> Sir, yonder is your place. 

PERICLES Some other is more fit.	 

FIRST KNIGHT Contend not, sir, for we are gentlemen Have neither in our hearts nor outward eyes Envies the great, nor shall the low despise. 

PERICLES You are right courteous knights. 

SIMONIDES Sit, sir, sit.	They sit. <ACTION>Aside.</ACTION> By Jove I wonder, that is king of thoughts, These cates resist me, he not thought upon. 

THAISA ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> By Juno, that is queen of marriage, All viands that I eat do seem unsavory, Wishing him my meat.—Sure, he’s a gallant	 gentleman. 

SIMONIDES He’s but a country gentleman; Has done no more than other knights have done; Has broken a staff or so. So let it pass. 

THAISA , <ACTION> aside</ACTION> To me he seems like diamond to glass.	 

PERICLES ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Yon king’s to me like to my father’s picture, Which tells in that glory once he was— Had princes sit like stars about his throne, And he the sun for them to reverence. None that beheld him but like lesser lights	 Did vail their crowns to his supremacy; Where now his son’s like a glowworm in the night, The which hath fire in darkness, none in light; Whereby I see that Time’s the king of men. He’s both their parent, and he is their grave,	 And gives them what he will, not what they crave. 

SIMONIDES What, are you merry, knights? 

KNIGHTS Who can be other in this royal presence? 

SIMONIDES Here, with a cup that’s stored unto the brim, As do you love, fill to your mistress’ lips.	 We drink this health to you.	 <ACTION>He drinks.</ACTION> 

KNIGHTS   We thank your Grace. 

SIMONIDES Yet pause awhile. Yon knight doth sit too melancholy, As if the entertainment in our court Had not a show might countervail his worth.—	 Note it not you, Thaisa? 

THAISA What is ’t to me, my father? 

SIMONIDES O, attend, my daughter. Princes in this Should live like gods above, who freely give To everyone that come to honor them.	 And princes not doing so are like to gnats, Which make a sound but, killed, are wondered at. Therefore, to make his entrance more sweet, Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him. <ACTION>He drinks.</ACTION> 

THAISA Alas, my father, it befits not me	 Unto a stranger knight to be so bold. He may my proffer take for an offense, Since men take women’s gifts for impudence. 

SIMONIDES How? Do as I bid you, or you’ll move me else.	 

THAISA ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Now, by the gods, he could not please me better. 

SIMONIDES And furthermore tell him we desire to know of him Of whence he is, his name and parentage. 

THAISA , <ACTION> going to Pericles</ACTION> The King, my father, sir, has drunk to you. 

PERICLES I thank him.	 

THAISA Wishing it so much blood unto your life. 

PERICLES I thank both him and you, and pledge him freely. <ACTION>He drinks to Simonides.</ACTION> 

THAISA And further, he desires to know of you Of whence you are, your name and parentage. 

PERICLES A gentleman of Tyre, my name Pericles.	 My education been in arts and arms, Who, looking for adventures in the world, Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men, And after shipwrack driven upon this shore. 

THAISA ,  <ACTION>returning to her place</ACTION> He thanks your Grace; names himself Pericles,	 A gentleman of Tyre, Who only by misfortune of the seas, Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore. 

SIMONIDES Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune, And will awake him from his melancholy.— Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles And waste the time which looks for other revels. Even in your armors, as you are addressed, Will well become a soldiers’ dance. I will not have excuse with saying this:	 “Loud music is too harsh for ladies’ heads,” Since they love men in arms as well as beds. <ACTION>They dance.</ACTION> So, this was well asked, ’twas so well performed. Come, sir.	He presents Pericles to Thaisa. Here’s a lady that wants breathing too,	 And I have heard you knights of Tyre Are excellent in making ladies trip, And that their measures are as excellent. 

PERICLES In those that practice them they are, my lord. 

SIMONIDES O, that’s as much as you would be denied Of your fair courtesy.	 <ACTION>They dance.</ACTION> Unclasp, unclasp! Thanks, gentlemen, to all; all have done well; To Pericles. But you the best.—Pages and lights, to conduct	 These knights unto their several lodgings.  <ACTION>ToPericles.</ACTION> Yours, sir, We have given order be next our own. 

PERICLES I am at your Grace’s pleasure. 

SIMONIDES Princes, it is too late to talk of love,	 And that’s the mark I know you level at. Therefore each one betake him to his rest, Tomorrow all for speeding do their best. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
