EGLAMOUR The sun begins to gild the western sky, And now it is about the very hour That Sylvia at Friar Patrick’s cell should meet me. She will not fail, for lovers break not hours, Unless it be to come before their time,	 So much they spur their expedition. 

<ACTION>Enter Sylvia.</ACTION> 

See where she comes.—Lady, a happy evening. 

SYLVIA Amen, amen. Go on, good Eglamour, Out at the postern by the abbey wall. I fear I am attended by some spies.	 

EGLAMOUR Fear not. The forest is not three leagues off; If we recover that, we are sure enough. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
