<ACTION>Enter Thersites; then Menelaus fighting Paris.</ACTION> 

THERSITES  The cuckold and the cuckold-maker are at it. Now, bull! Now, dog! Loo, Paris, loo! Now, my double-horned Spartan! Loo, Paris, loo! The bull has the game. Ware horns, ho! 

<ACTION>Paris and Menelaus exit, fighting.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Bastard.</ACTION> 

BASTARD Turn, slave, and fight.	 

THERSITES What art thou? 

BASTARD A bastard son of Priam’s. 

THERSITES I am a bastard too. I love bastards. I am bastard begot, bastard instructed, bastard in mind, bastard in valor, in everything illegitimate. One	 bear will not bite another, and wherefore should one bastard? Take heed: the quarrel’s most ominous to us. If the son of a whore fight for a whore, he tempts judgment. Farewell, bastard. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

BASTARD The devil take thee, coward!	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
