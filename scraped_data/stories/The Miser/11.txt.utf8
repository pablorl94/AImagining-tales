SCENE II.--HARPAGON, MR. SIMON (CLÉANTE _and_ LA FLÈCHE _at the back of the stage_). 

SIM. Yes, Sir; it is a young man who is greatly in want of money; his affairs force him to find some at any cost, and he will submit to all your conditions. 

HAR. But are you sure, Mr. Simon, that there is no risk to run in this case? and do you know the name, the property, and the family of him for whom you speak? 

SIM. No; I cannot tell you anything for certain, as it was by mere chance that I was made acquainted with him; but he will tell you everything himself, and his servant has assured me that you will be quite satisfied when you know who he is. All I can tell you is that his family is said to be very wealthy, that he has already lost his mother, and that he will pledge you his word, if you insist upon it, that his father will die before eight months are passed. 

HAR. That is something. Charity, Mr. Simon, demands of us to gratify people whenever we have it in our power. 

SIM. Evidently. 

LA FL. (_aside to_ CLÉANTE, _on recognising_ MR. SIMON). What does this mean? Mr. Simon talking with your father! 

CLE. (_aside to_ LA FLÈCHE). Has he been told who I am, and would you be capable of betraying me? 

SIM. (_to_ CLÉANTE _and_ LA FLÈCHE). Ah! you are in good time! But who told you to come here? (_To_ HARPAGON) It was certainly not I who told them your name and address; but I am of opinion that there is no great harm done; they are people who can be trusted, and you can come to some understanding together. 

HAR. What! 

SIM. (_showing_ CLÉANTE). This is the gentleman who wants to borrow the fifteen thousand francs of which I have spoken to you. 

HAR. What! miscreant! is it you who abandon yourself to such excesses? 

CLE. What! father! is it you who stoop to such shameful deeds? 

(MR. SIMON _runs away, and_ LA FLÈCHE _hides himself_.)
