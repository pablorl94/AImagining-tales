<ACTION>Enter Romeo.</ACTION> 

ROMEO If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep, My dreams presage some joyful news at hand. My bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne, And all this day an unaccustomed spirit Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.	 I dreamt my lady came and found me dead (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!) And breathed such life with kisses in my lips That I revived and was an emperor.	 Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed When but love’s shadows are so rich in joy! 

<ACTION>Enter Romeo’s man Balthasar, in riding boots.</ACTION> 

News from Verona!—How now, Balthasar? Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar? How doth my lady? Is my father well?	 How doth my Juliet? That I ask again, For nothing can be ill if she be well. 

BALTHASAR Then she is well and nothing can be ill. Her body sleeps in Capels’ monument, And her immortal part with angels lives.	 I saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault And presently took post to tell it you. O, pardon me for bringing these ill news, Since you did leave it for my office, sir. 

ROMEO Is it e’en so?—Then I deny you, stars!—	 Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper, And hire post-horses. I will hence tonight. 

BALTHASAR I do beseech you, sir, have patience. Your looks are pale and wild and do import Some misadventure.	 

ROMEO Tush, thou art deceived. Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do. Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar? 

BALTHASAR No, my good lord. 

ROMEO No matter. Get thee gone,	 And hire those horses. I’ll be with thee straight. <ACTION>Balthasar exits.</ACTION> Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. Let’s see for means. O mischief, thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men. I do remember an apothecary	 (And hereabouts he dwells) which late I noted In tattered weeds, with overwhelming brows, Culling of simples. Meager were his looks. Sharp misery had worn him to the bones. And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,	 An alligator stuffed, and other skins Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves, A beggarly account of empty boxes, Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds, Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses	 Were thinly scattered to make up a show. Noting this penury, to myself I said “An if a man did need a poison now, Whose sale is present death in Mantua, Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.”	 O, this same thought did but forerun my need, And this same needy man must sell it me. As I remember, this should be the house. Being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.— What ho, Apothecary!	 

Enter Apothecary. 

APOTHECARY Who calls so loud? 

ROMEO Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor. <ACTION>He offers money.</ACTION> Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear As will disperse itself through all the veins,	 That the life-weary taker may fall dead, And that the trunk may be discharged of breath As violently as hasty powder fired Doth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb. 

APOTHECARY Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua’s law	 Is death to any he that utters them. 

ROMEO Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness, And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks, Need and oppression starveth in thy eyes, Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.	 The world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law. The world affords no law to make thee rich. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this. 

APOTHECARY My poverty, but not my will, consents. 

ROMEO I pay thy poverty and not thy will.	 

APOTHECARY , <ACTION> giving him the poison</ACTION> Put this in any liquid thing you will And drink it off, and if you had the strength Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight. 

ROMEO ,  <ACTION>handing him the money</ACTION> There is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls, Doing more murder in this loathsome world	 Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell. I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none. Farewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh. <ACTION>Apothecary exits.</ACTION> Come, cordial and not poison, go with me	 To Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
