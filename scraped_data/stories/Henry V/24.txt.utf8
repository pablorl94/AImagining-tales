Added to these, Of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen, Eight thousand and four hundred, of the which Five hundred were but yesterday dubbed knights. So that in these ten thousand they have lost,	 There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries. The rest are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires, And gentlemen of blood and quality.

When, without stratagem, But in plain shock and even play of battle, Was ever known so great and little loss On one part and on th’ other? Take it, God,	 For it is none but thine. 

EXETER ’Tis wonderful. 

KING HENRY Come, go we in procession to the village, And be it death proclaimèd through our host To boast of this or take that praise from God	 Which is His only.
