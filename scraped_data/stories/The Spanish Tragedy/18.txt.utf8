[ACT III.  SCENE 9.] 

[The DUKE's castle.] 

BEL-IMPERIA at a window. 

BEL.  What meanes this outrage that is offred me? What am I thus sequestred from the court? No notice?  shall I not know the cause Of these my secret and suspitious ils? Accursed brother!  vnkinde murderer! Why bends thou thus thy minde to martir me? Hieronimo, why writ I of they wrongs, Or why art thou so slack in thy reuenge? Andrea!  O Andrea, that thou sawest Me for thy freend Horatio handled thus, And him for me thus causeles murdered! Well, force perforce, I must constraine my-selfe To patience, and apply me to the time, Till Heauen, as I haue hoped, shall set me free. 

Enter [CHRISTOPHEL.] 

CHRIS.  Come, Madame Bel-imperia, this [must] not be! 

Exeunt.
