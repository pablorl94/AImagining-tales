<ACTION>Enter Lord Cerimon with two Suppliants.</ACTION> 

CERIMON Philemon, ho! 

<ACTION>Enter Philemon.</ACTION> 

PHILEMON Doth my lord call? 

CERIMON Get fire and meat for these poor men. ’T has been a turbulent and stormy night. 

<ACTION>Philemon exits.</ACTION> 

FIRST SUPPLIANT I have been in many; but such a night as this,	 Till now, I ne’er endured. 

CERIMON Your master will be dead ere you return. There’s nothing can be ministered to nature That can recover him. To Second Suppliant. Give this to the ’pothecary,	 And tell me how it works.	Suppliants exit. 

<ACTION>Enter two Gentlemen.</ACTION> 

FIRST GENTLEMAN Good morrow. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN  Good morrow to your Lordship. 

CERIMON Gentlemen, why do you stir so early? 

FIRST GENTLEMAN   Sir,	 Our lodgings, standing bleak upon the sea, Shook as the earth did quake. The very principals did seem to rend And all to topple. Pure surprise and fear Made me to quit the house.	 

SECOND GENTLEMAN That is the cause we trouble you so early. ’Tis not our husbandry. 

CERIMON O, you say well. 

FIRST GENTLEMAN But I much marvel that your Lordship, having Rich tire about you, should at these early hours	 Shake off the golden slumber of repose. ’Tis most strange Nature should be so conversant with pain, Being thereto not compelled. 

CERIMON I hold it ever	 Virtue and cunning were endowments greater Than nobleness and riches. Careless heirs May the two latter darken and expend, But immortality attends the former, Making a man a god. ’Tis known I ever	 Have studied physic, through which secret art, By turning o’er authorities, I have, Together with my practice, made familiar To me and to my aid the blessed infusions That dwells in vegetives, in metals, stones;	 And can speak of the disturbances That Nature works, and of her cures; which doth give me A more content in course of true delight Than to be thirsty after tottering honor,	 Or tie my pleasure up in silken bags To please the fool and death. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN Your Honor has through Ephesus poured forth Your charity, and hundreds call themselves Your creatures, who by you have been restored;	 And not your knowledge, your personal pain, but even Your purse, still open, hath built Lord Cerimon Such strong renown, as time shall never— 

<ACTION>Enter two or three Servants with a chest.</ACTION> 

SERVANT So, lift there. 

CERIMON  What’s that?	 

SERVANT   Sir, even now Did the sea toss up upon our shore this chest. ’Tis of some wrack. 

CERIMON Set ’t down. Let’s look upon ’t. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN ’Tis like a coffin, sir.	 

CERIMON What e’er it be, ’Tis wondrous heavy. Wrench it open straight. If the sea’s stomach be o’ercharged with gold, ’Tis a good constraint of Fortune it belches upon us. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN ’Tis so, my lord. 

CERIMON How close ’tis caulked and bitumed! Did the sea cast it up? 

SERVANT I never saw so huge a billow, sir, As tossed it upon shore. 

CERIMON Wrench it open.	 Soft! It smells most sweetly in my sense. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN A delicate odor. 

CERIMON As ever hit my nostril. So, up with it. 

<ACTION>They open the chest.</ACTION> 

O, you most potent gods! What’s here? A corse? 

SECOND GENTLEMAN Most strange!	 

CERIMON Shrouded in cloth of state, balmed and entreasured With full bags of spices. A passport too! Apollo, perfect me in the characters. <ACTION>He reads.</ACTION> Here I give to understand, If e’er this coffin drives aland,	 I, King Pericles, have lost This queen, worth all our mundane cost. Who finds her, give her burying. She was the daughter of a king. Besides this treasure for a fee,	 The gods requite his charity. If thou livest, Pericles, thou hast a heart That ever cracks for woe. This chanced tonight. 

SECOND GENTLEMAN Most likely, sir. 

CERIMON Nay, certainly tonight, For look how fresh she looks. They were too rough That threw her in the sea.—Make a fire within; Fetch hither all my boxes in my closet. <ACTION>A servant exits.</ACTION> Death may usurp on nature many hours, And yet the fire of life kindle again	 The o’erpressed spirits. I heard of an Egyptian That had nine hours lain dead, Who was by good appliance recoverèd. 

<ACTION>Enter one with boxes, napkins, and fire.</ACTION> 

Well said, well said! The fire and cloths. The rough and woeful music that we have,	 Cause it to sound, beseech you. Music sounds. The viol once more! How thou stirr’st, thou block! The music there. <ACTION>Music sounds.</ACTION> I pray you, give her air. Gentlemen, This queen will live. Nature awakes a warm breath	 Out of her. She hath not been entranced Above five hours. See how she gins to blow Into life’s flower again. 

FIRST GENTLEMAN The heavens, through you, Increase our wonder, and sets up your fame	 Forever. 

CERIMON She is alive. Behold her eyelids— Cases to those heavenly jewels which Pericles hath lost— Begin to part their fringes of bright gold.	 The diamonds of a most praised water doth Appear to make the world twice rich.—Live, And make us weep to hear your fate, fair creature, Rare as you seem to be. 

<ACTION>She moves.</ACTION> 

THAISA O dear Diana,	 Where am I? Where’s my lord? What world is this? 

SECOND GENTLEMAN Is not this strange? 

FIRST GENTLEMAN Most rare! 

CERIMON  Hush, my gentle neighbors! Lend me your hands. To the next chamber bear her. Get linen. Now this matter must be looked to, For her relapse is mortal. Come, come; And Aesculapius guide us. 

<ACTION>They carry her away as they all exit.</ACTION>
