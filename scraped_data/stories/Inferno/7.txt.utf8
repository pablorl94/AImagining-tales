CANTO VIII. 

I say, continuing,[312] that long before To its foundations we approachèd nigh Our eyes went travelling to the top of the tower; For, hung out there, two flames[313] we could espy. Then at such distance, scarce our eyesight made It clearly out, another gave reply. And, to the Sea of Knowledge turned, I said: 'What meaneth this? and what reply would yield That other light, and who have it displayed?' 'Thou shouldst upon the impure watery field,'                     10 He said, 'already what approaches know, But that the fen-fog holds it still concealed.' Never was arrow yet from sharp-drawn bow Urged through the air upon a swifter flight Than what I saw a tiny vessel show, Across the water shooting into sight; A single pilot served it for a crew, Who shouted: 'Art thou come, thou guilty sprite? '[314] 'O Phlegyas, Phlegyas,[315] this thy loud halloo! For once,' my Lord said, 'idle is and vain. 20 Thou hast us only till the mud we're through.' And, as one cheated inly smarts with pain When the deceit wrought on him is betrayed, His gathering ire could Phlegyas scarce contain. 

Into the bark my Leader stepped, and made Me take my place beside him; nor a jot, Till I had entered, was it downward weighed.Soon as my Guide and I were in the boat, To cleave the flood began the ancient prow, Deeper[316] than 'tis with others wont to float. 30 Then, as the stagnant ditch we glided through, One smeared with filth in front of me arose And said: 'Thus coming ere thy period,[317] who Art thou?' And I: 'As one who forthwith goes I come; but thou defiled, how name they thee?' 'I am but one who weeps,'[318] he said. 'With woes,' I answered him, 'with tears and misery, Accursèd soul, remain; for thou art known Unto me now, all filthy though thou be.' Then both his hands were on the vessel thrown;                    40 But him my wary Master backward heaved, Saying: 'Do thou 'mong the other dogs be gone!' Then to my neck with both his arms he cleaved, And kissed my face, and, 'Soul disdainful,'[319] said, 'O blessed she in whom thou wast conceived! He in the world great haughtiness displayed. 

No deeds of worth his memory adorn; And therefore rages here his sinful shade.And many are there by whom crowns are worn On earth, shall wallow here like swine in mire,                 50 Leaving behind them names o'erwhelmed[320] in scorn.' And I: 'O Master, I have great desire To see him well soused in this filthy tide, Ere from the lake we finally retire.' And he: 'Or ever shall have been descried The shore by thee, thy longing shall be met; For such a wish were justly gratified.' A little after in such fierce onset The miry people down upon him bore, I praise and bless God for it even yet. 60 'Philip Argenti! [321] at him!' was the roar; And then that furious spirit Florentine Turned with his teeth upon himself and tore. Here was he left, nor wins more words of mine. Now in my ears a lamentation rung, Whence I to search what lies ahead begin. And the good Master told me: 'Son, ere long We to the city called of Dis[322] draw near, Where in great armies cruel burghers[323] throng.' 

And I: 'Already, Master, I appear                                 70 Mosques[324] in the valley to distinguish well, Vermilion, as if they from furnace were Fresh come.'And he: 'Fires everlasting dwell Within them, whence appear they glowing hot, As thou discernest in this lower hell.' We to the moat profound at length were brought, Which girds that city all disconsolate; The walls around it seemed of iron wrought. Not without fetching first a compass great, We came to where with angry cry at last:                        80 'Get out,' the boatman yelled; 'behold the gate! '[325] More than a thousand, who from Heaven[326] were cast, I saw above the gates, who furiously Demanded: 'Who, ere death on him has passed, Holds through the region of the dead his way?' And my wise Master made to them a sign That he had something secretly to say. Then ceased they somewhat from their great disdain, And said: 'Come thou, but let that one be gone Who thus presumptuous enters on this reign. 90 Let him retrace his madcap way alone, If he but can; thou meanwhile lingering here, Through such dark regions who hast led him down.' 

Judge, reader, if I was not filled with fear, Hearing the words of this accursèd threat; For of return my hopes extinguished were.'Beloved Guide, who more than seven times[327] set Me in security, and safely brought Through frightful dangers in my progress met, Leave me not thus undone;' I him besought:                       100 'If further progress be to us denied, Let us retreat together, tarrying not.' The Lord who led me thither then replied: 'Fear not: by One so great has been assigned Our passage, vainly were all hindrance tried. Await me here, and let thy fainting mind Be comforted and with good hope be fed, Not to be left in this low world behind.' Thus goes he, thus am I abandonèd By my sweet Father. I in doubt remain,                         110 With Yes and No[328] contending in my head. I could not hear what speech he did maintain, But no long time conferred he in that place, Till, to be first, all inward raced again. 

And then the gates were closed in my Lord's face By these our enemies; outside stood he; Then backward turned to me with lingering pace, With downcast eyes, and all the bravery Stripped from his brows; and he exclaimed with sighs; 'Who dare[329] deny the doleful seats to me!'120 And then he said: 'Although my wrath arise, Fear not, for I to victory will pursue, Howe'er within they plot, the enterprise. This arrogance of theirs is nothing new; They showed it[330] once at a less secret door Which stands unbolted since. Thou didst it view, And saw the dark-writ legend which it bore. Thence, even now, is one who hastens down Through all the circles, guideless, to this shore, And he shall win us entrance to the town.' 130
