Having no money, Dmitri pawns his silver watch for six roubles and borrows three roubles from his landlords. Then off to Ilyinskoye he goes.

At Ilyinskoye he meets up with the priest Lyagavy is staying with. The priest tells him that Lyagavy – who should be called Gorstkin, since he hates the name Lyagavy – is staying with a forester at Sukhoy Possyolok.

Upon their arrival at the forester's, they discover that Lyagavy is passed out drunk in his room.

Unable to wake him, Dmitri decides to wait outside the drunk's room until he wakes up. The priest heads back to Ilyinskoye.

Dmitri must have fallen asleep, because all of a sudden he wakes up to find the room filled with fumes. The forester helps Dmitri air out the room, but Lyagavy sleeps peacefully on.

Dmitri again falls asleep outside Lyagavy's room, and the next time he wakes it's 9 in the morning. He finds that Lyagavy has already started drinking heavily again. He tries to engage Lyagavy in conversation, but Lyagavy keeps accusing him of being out to cheat him.

Realizing that he's been the victim of Samsonov's malicious trickery, Dmitri returns back home and straight to Grushenka's.
