Harpagon goes running around the house screaming that his money has been stolen. He gives us a ridiculously melodramatic speech about how losing his money will surely kill him. Simmer down there, H.

He plans on accusing everyone in town of robbing him. He'll torture each person until he gets it back. According to the wise Mr. H, he'll then hang everyone, and if he still doesn't get his money back he'll hang himself. Jeepers.
