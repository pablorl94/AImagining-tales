<ACTION>Enter Cade.</ACTION> 

CADE Fie on ambitions! Fie on myself, that have a sword and yet am ready to famish! These five days have I hid me in these woods and durst not peep out, for all the country is laid for me. But now am I so hungry that, if I might have a lease of my life for a thousand years, I could stay no longer. Wherefore, o’er a brick wall have I climbed into this garden, to see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet another while, which is not amiss to cool a man’s stomach this hot weather. And I think this word sallet was born to do me good; for many a time, but for a sallet, my brainpan had been cleft with a brown bill; and many a time, when I have been dry and bravely marching, it hath served me instead of a quart pot to drink in; and now the word sallet	 must serve me to feed on. 

<ACTION>Enter Iden and his Men.</ACTION> 

IDEN Lord, who would live turmoilèd in the court And may enjoy such quiet walks as these? This small inheritance my father left me Contenteth me, and worth a monarchy.	 I seek not to wax great by others’ waning, Or gather wealth, I care not with what envy. Sufficeth that I have maintains my state And sends the poor well pleasèd from my gate. 

CADE ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Here’s the lord of the soil come to seize me for a stray, for entering his fee-simple without leave.—Ah, villain, thou wilt betray me and get a thousand crowns of the King by carrying my head to him; but I’ll make thee eat iron like an ostrich and swallow my sword like a great pin, ere thou	 and I part.	 <ACTION>He draws his sword.</ACTION> 

IDEN Why, rude companion, whatsoe’er thou be, I know thee not. Why, then, should I betray thee? Is ’t not enough to break into my garden And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,	 Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner, But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms? 

CADE  Brave thee? Ay, by the best blood that ever was broached, and beard thee too. Look on me well: I have eat no meat these five days, yet come thou	 and thy five men, and if I do not leave you all as dead as a doornail, I pray God I may never eat grass more. 

IDEN Nay, it shall ne’er be said, while England stands, That Alexander Iden, an esquire of Kent, Took odds to combat a poor famished man. Oppose thy steadfast gazing eyes to mine; See if thou canst outface me with thy looks. Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser; Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,	 Thy leg a stick comparèd with this truncheon. My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast; And if mine arm be heavèd in the air, Thy grave is digged already in the earth. As for words, whose greatness answers words,	 Let this my sword report what speech forbears. <ACTION>He draws his sword.</ACTION> 

CADE   By my valor, the most complete champion that ever I heard! Steel, if thou turn the edge or cut not out the burly-boned clown in chines of beef ere thou sleep in thy sheath, I beseech God on my	 knees thou mayst be turned to hobnails. 

<ACTION>(Here they fight, and Cade falls.)</ACTION> 

O, I am slain! Famine, and no other, hath slain me. Let ten thousand devils come against me, and give me but the ten meals I have lost, and I’d defy them all. Wither, garden, and be henceforth a burying place to all that do dwell in this house, because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled. 

IDEN Is ’t Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor? Sword, I will hallow thee for this thy deed, And hang thee o’er my tomb when I am dead.	 Ne’er shall this blood be wipèd from thy point, But thou shalt wear it as a herald’s coat To emblaze the honor that thy master got. 

CADE  Iden, farewell, and be proud of thy victory. Tell Kent from me she hath lost her best man, and	 exhort all the world to be cowards; for I, that never feared any, am vanquished by famine, not by valor. <ACTION>Dies.</ACTION> 

IDEN How much thou wrong’st me, heaven be my judge! Die, damnèd wretch, the curse of her that bare thee! And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,	 So wish I, I might thrust thy soul to hell. Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels Unto a dunghill, which shall be thy grave, And there cut off thy most ungracious head, Which I will bear in triumph to the King, Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon. 

<ACTION>He exits with his Men, dragging Cade’s body.</ACTION>
