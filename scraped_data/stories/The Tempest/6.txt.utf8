<ACTION>Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Gonzalo, Adrian,Francisco, etc.</ACTION> 

GONZALO By ’r lakin, I can go no further, sir. My old bones aches. Here’s a maze trod indeed Through forthrights and meanders. By your patience, I needs must rest me.	 

ALONSO Old lord, I cannot blame thee. Who am myself attached with weariness To th’ dulling of my spirits. Sit down and rest. Even here I will put off my hope and keep it No longer for my flatterer. He is drowned	 Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go. 

ANTONIO ,  <ACTION>aside to Sebastian</ACTION> I am right glad that he’s so out of hope. Do not, for one repulse, forgo the purpose That you resolved t’ effect.	 

SEBASTIAN ,  <ACTION>aside to Antonio</ACTION> The next advantage Will we take throughly. 

ANTONIO ,  <ACTION>aside to Sebastian</ACTION> Let it be tonight; For now they are oppressed with travel, they Will not nor cannot use such vigilance	 As when they are fresh. 

SEBASTIAN ,  <ACTION>aside to Antonio</ACTION> I say tonight. No more. 

<ACTION>Solemn and strange music, and enter Prospero on thetop invisible.</ACTION> 

ALONSO What harmony is this? My good friends, hark. 

GONZALO Marvelous sweet music! 

<ACTION>Enter several strange shapes, bringing in a banquet, anddance about it with gentle actions of salutations.</ACTION> 

ALONSO Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?	 

SEBASTIAN A living drollery! Now I will believe That there are unicorns, that in Arabia There is one tree, the phoenix’ throne, one phoenix At this hour reigning there. 

ANTONIO  I’ll believe both;	 And what does else want credit, come to me And I’ll be sworn ’tis true. Travelers ne’er did lie, Though fools at home condemn ’em. 

GONZALO If in Naples I should report this now, would they believe me?	 If I should say I saw such islanders— For, certes, these are people of the island— Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet note Their manners are more gentle, kind, than of Our human generation you shall find	 Many, nay, almost any. 

PROSPERO ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Honest lord, Thou hast said well, for some of you there present Are worse than devils. 

ALONSO  I cannot too much muse	 Such shapes, such gesture, and such sound, expressing— Although they want the use of tongue—a kind Of excellent dumb discourse. 

PROSPERO ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> Praise in departing.	 

<ACTION>Inviting the King, etc., to eat, the shapes depart.</ACTION> 

FRANCISCO They vanished strangely. 

SEBASTIAN No matter, since They have left their viands behind, for we have stomachs. Will ’t please you taste of what is here?	 

ALONSO Not I. 

GONZALO Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys, Who would believe that there were mountaineers Dewlapped like bulls, whose throats had hanging at ’em		 Wallets of flesh? Or that there were such men Whose heads stood in their breasts? Which now we find Each putter-out of five for one will bring us Good warrant of.	 

ALONSO  I will stand to and feed. Although my last, no matter, since I feel The best is past. Brother, my lord the Duke, Stand to, and do as we. 

<ACTION>Alonso, Sebastian, and Antoniomove toward the table.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Thunder and lightning. Enter Ariel, like a Harpy, clapshis wings upon the table, and with a quaint device thebanquet vanishes.</ACTION> 

ARIEL <ACTION>as Harpy</ACTION> You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,	 That hath to instrument this lower world And what is in ’t, the never-surfeited sea Hath caused to belch up you, and on this island, Where man doth not inhabit, you ’mongst men Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;	 And even with such-like valor, men hang and drown Their proper selves. 

<ACTION>Alonso, Sebastian, and Antonio draw their swords.</ACTION> 

You fools, I and my fellows Are ministers of Fate. The elements Of whom your swords are tempered may as well	 Wound the loud winds or with bemocked-at stabs Kill the still-closing waters as diminish One dowl that’s in my plume. My fellow ministers Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt, Your swords are now too massy for your strengths	 And will not be uplifted. But remember— For that’s my business to you—that you three From Milan did supplant good Prospero, Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it, Him and his innocent child, for which foul deed,	 The powers—delaying, not forgetting—have Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso, They have bereft; and do pronounce by me Ling’ring perdition, worse than any death	 Can be at once, shall step by step attend You and your ways, whose wraths to guard you from— Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls Upon your heads—is nothing but heart’s sorrow	 And a clear life ensuing.	 

<ACTION>He vanishes in thunder.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Then, to soft music, enter the shapes again, and dance,with mocks and mows, and carrying out the table.</ACTION> 

PROSPERO ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Bravely the figure of this Harpy hast thou Performed, my Ariel. A grace it had, devouring. Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated In what thou hadst to say. So, with good life	 And observation strange, my meaner ministers Their several kinds have done. My high charms work, And these mine enemies are all knit up In their distractions. They now are in my power;	 And in these fits I leave them while I visit Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drowned, And his and mine loved darling.	 

<ACTION>He exits, above.</ACTION> 

GONZALO ,  <ACTION>to Alonso</ACTION> I’ th’ name of something holy, sir, why stand you In this strange stare?	 

ALONSO O, it is monstrous, monstrous! Methought the billows spoke and told me of it; The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder, That deep and dreadful organ pipe, pronounced The name of Prosper. It did bass my trespass.	 Therefor my son i’ th’ ooze is bedded, and I’ll seek him deeper than e’er plummet sounded, And with him there lie mudded.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

SEBASTIAN But one fiend at a time, I’ll fight their legions o’er.	 

ANTONIO I’ll be thy second. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION> 

GONZALO All three of them are desperate. Their great guilt, Like poison given to work a great time after, Now ’gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly	 And hinder them from what this ecstasy May now provoke them to. 

ADRIAN Follow, I pray you. 

<ACTION>They all exit.</ACTION>
