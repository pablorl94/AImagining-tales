<ACTION>Enter Helen and Widow.</ACTION> 

HELEN If you misdoubt me that I am not she, I know not how I shall assure you further But I shall lose the grounds I work upon. 

WIDOW Though my estate be fall’n, I was well born, Nothing acquainted with these businesses,	 And would not put my reputation now In any staining act. 

HELEN Nor would I wish you. First give me trust the Count he is my husband, And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken	 Is so from word to word; and then you cannot, By the good aid that I of you shall borrow, Err in bestowing it. 

WIDOW I should believe you, For you have showed me that which well approves	 You’re great in fortune. 

HELEN Take this purse of gold, And let me buy your friendly help thus far, Which I will overpay and pay again When I have found it. The Count he woos your	 daughter, Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty, Resolved to carry her. Let her in fine consent As we’ll direct her how ’tis best to bear it. Now his important blood will naught deny	 That she’ll demand. A ring the County wears That downward hath succeeded in his house From son to son some four or five descents Since the first father wore it. This ring he holds In most rich choice. Yet, in his idle fire,	 To buy his will it would not seem too dear, Howe’er repented after. 

WIDOW Now I see the bottom of your purpose. 

HELEN You see it lawful, then. It is no more But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,	 Desires this ring, appoints him an encounter, In fine, delivers me to fill the time, Herself most chastely absent. After, To marry her, I’ll add three thousand crowns To what is passed already.	 

WIDOW I have yielded. Instruct my daughter how she shall persever That time and place with this deceit so lawful May prove coherent. Every night he comes With musics of all sorts and songs composed	 To her unworthiness. It nothing steads us To chide him from our eaves, for he persists As if his life lay on ’t. 

HELEN Why then tonight Let us assay our plot, which, if it speed,	 Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed, And lawful meaning in a lawful act, Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact. But let’s about it. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
