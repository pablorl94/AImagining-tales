<ACTION>Enter, with Drum and Colors, Edmund, Regan,Gentlemen, and Soldiers.</ACTION> 

EDMUND , <ACTION> to a Gentleman</ACTION> Know of the Duke if his last purpose hold, Or whether since he is advised by aught To change the course. He’s full of alteration And self-reproving. Bring his constant pleasure. 

<ACTION>A Gentleman exits.</ACTION> 

REGAN Our sister’s man is certainly miscarried.	 

EDMUND ’Tis to be doubted, madam. 

REGAN Now, sweet lord, You know the goodness I intend upon you; Tell me but truly, but then speak the truth, Do you not love my sister?	 

EDMUND In honored love. 

REGAN But have you never found my brother’s way To the forfended place? 

EDMUND That thought abuses you. 

REGAN I am doubtful that you have been conjunct	 And bosomed with her as far as we call hers. 

EDMUND No, by mine honor, madam. 

REGAN I never shall endure her. Dear my lord, Be not familiar with her. 

EDMUND Fear me not. She and the Duke, her husband.	 

<ACTION>Enter, with Drum and Colors, Albany, Goneril, Soldiers.</ACTION> 

GONERIL ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> I had rather lose the battle than that sister Should loosen him and me. 

ALBANY Our very loving sister, well bemet.— Sir, this I heard: the King is come to his daughter, With others whom the rigor of our state	 Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest, I never yet was valiant. For this business, It touches us as France invades our land, Not bolds the King, with others whom, I fear, Most just and heavy causes make oppose.	 

EDMUND Sir, you speak nobly. 

REGAN Why is this reasoned? 

GONERIL Combine together ’gainst the enemy, For these domestic and particular broils Are not the question here.	 

ALBANY Let’s then determine With th’ ancient of war on our proceeding. 

EDMUND I shall attend you presently at your tent. 

REGAN Sister, you’ll go with us? 

GONERIL No.	 

REGAN ’Tis most convenient. Pray, go with us. 

GONERIL , <ACTION> aside</ACTION> Oho, I know the riddle.—I will go. 

<ACTION>They begin to exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Edgar dressed as a peasant.</ACTION> 

EDGAR ,  <ACTION>to Albany</ACTION> If e’er your Grace had speech with man so poor, Hear me one word. 

ALBANY ,  <ACTION>to those exiting</ACTION> I’ll overtake you.—Speak.	 

<ACTION>Both the armies exit.</ACTION> 

EDGAR ,  <ACTION>giving him a paper</ACTION> Before you fight the battle, ope this letter. If you have victory, let the trumpet sound For him that brought it. Wretched though I seem, I can produce a champion that will prove What is avouchèd there. If you miscarry,	 Your business of the world hath so an end, And machination ceases. Fortune love you. 

ALBANY  Stay till I have read the letter. 

EDGAR I was forbid it. When time shall serve, let but the herald cry	 And I’ll appear again.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

ALBANY Why, fare thee well. I will o’erlook thy paper. 

EDMUND The enemy’s in view. Draw up your powers. <ACTION>Giving him a paper.</ACTION> Here is the guess of their true strength and forces By diligent discovery. But your haste	 Is now urged on you. 

ALBANY We will greet the time. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

EDMUND To both these sisters have I sworn my love, Each jealous of the other as the stung Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?	 Both? One? Or neither? Neither can be enjoyed If both remain alive. To take the widow Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril, And hardly shall I carry out my side, Her husband being alive. Now, then, we’ll use	 His countenance for the battle, which, being done, Let her who would be rid of him devise His speedy taking off. As for the mercy Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia, The battle done and they within our power,	 Shall never see his pardon, for my state Stands on me to defend, not to debate. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
