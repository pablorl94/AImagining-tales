<ACTION>Enter three Watchmen to guard King Edward’s tent,all wearing the white rose.</ACTION> 

FIRST WATCH Come on, my masters, each man take his stand. The King by this is set him down to sleep. 

SECOND WATCH What, will he not to bed? 

FIRST WATCH Why, no, for he hath made a solemn vow Never to lie and take his natural rest	 Till Warwick or himself be quite suppressed. 

SECOND WATCH Tomorrow, then, belike shall be the day, If Warwick be so near as men report. 

THIRD WATCH But say, I pray, what nobleman is that That with the King here resteth in his tent?	 

FIRST WATCH ’Tis the Lord Hastings, the King’s chiefest friend. 

THIRD WATCH O, is it so? But why commands the King That his chief followers lodge in towns about him, While he himself keeps in the cold field? 

SECOND WATCH ’Tis the more honor, because more dangerous.	 

THIRD WATCH Ay, but give me worship and quietness; I like it better than a dangerous honor. If Warwick knew in what estate he stands, ’Tis to be doubted he would waken him. 

FIRST WATCH Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.	 

SECOND WATCH Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent But to defend his person from night foes? 

<ACTION>Enter Warwick, Clarence, Oxford, Somerset, all wearingthe red rose, and French Soldiers, silent all.</ACTION> 

WARWICK This is his tent, and see where stand his guard. Courage, my masters. Honor, now or never! But follow me, and Edward shall be ours. 

FIRST WATCH  Who goes there? 

SECOND WATCH  Stay, or thou diest! 

<ACTION>Warwick and the rest cry all “Warwick, Warwick!”and set upon the guard, who fly, crying “Arm, Arm!”Warwick and the rest following them.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>The drum playing and trumpet sounding,enter Warwick, Somerset, and the rest, bringingKing Edward out in his gown, sitting in a chair.Richard and Hastings flies over the stage.</ACTION> 

SOMERSET What are they that fly there? 

WARWICK Richard and Hastings. Let them go. Here is the Duke.	 

KING EDWARD The Duke? Why, Warwick, when we parted, thou call’dst me king. 

WARWICK   Ay, but the case is altered. When you disgraced me in my embassade, Then I degraded you from being king	 And come now to create you Duke of York. Alas, how should you govern any kingdom That know not how to use ambassadors, Nor how to be contented with one wife, Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,	 Nor how to study for the people’s welfare, Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies? 

WARWICK Then for his mind be Edward England’s king,	 

<ACTION>Takes off his crown.</ACTION> 

But Henry now shall wear the English crown And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow.— My lord of Somerset, at my request, See that forthwith Duke Edward be conveyed Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.	 When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows, I’ll follow you and tell what answer Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.— Now for awhile farewell, good Duke of York. 

<ACTION>They begin to lead him out forcibly.</ACTION> 

KING EDWARD What Fates impose, that men must needs abide;	 It boots not to resist both wind and tide. 

<ACTION>Somerset and Soldiers exit, guarding King Edward.</ACTION> 

OXFORD What now remains, my lords, for us to do But march to London with our soldiers? 

WARWICK Ay, that’s the first thing that we have to do, To free King Henry from imprisonment	 And see him seated in the regal throne. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
