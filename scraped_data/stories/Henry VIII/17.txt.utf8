CRANMER ,  <ACTION>kneeling</ACTION> And to your royal Grace and the good queen, My noble partners and myself thus pray	 All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy May hourly fall upon you! 

KING Thank you, good lord Archbishop.	 What is her name? 

CRANMER  Elizabeth. 

KING   Stand up, lord. 

<ACTION>Cranmer stands.</ACTION> 

With this kiss take my blessing.	 <ACTION>King kisses infant.</ACTION> God protect thee,	 Into whose hand I give thy life. 

CRANMER Amen. 

KING , <ACTION> to the two godmothers</ACTION> My noble gossips, you’ve been too prodigal. I thank you heartily; so shall this lady When she has so much English.	 

CRANMER Let me speak, sir, For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter Let none think flattery, for they’ll find ’em truth. This royal infant—heaven still move about her!— Though in her cradle, yet now promises Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings, Which time shall bring to ripeness. She shall be— But few now living can behold that goodness— A pattern to all princes living with her And all that shall succeed. Saba was never	 More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue Than this pure soul shall be. All princely graces That mold up such a mighty piece as this is, With all the virtues that attend the good, Shall still be doubled on her. Truth shall nurse her; Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her. She shall be loved and feared. Her own shall bless her; Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn And hang their heads with sorrow. Good grows with her. In her days every man shall eat in safety Under his own vine what he plants and sing The merry songs of peace to all his neighbors. God shall be truly known, and those about her From her shall read the perfect ways of honor And by those claim their greatness, not by blood. 

Nor shall this peace sleep with her; but, as when The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix, Her ashes new create another heir As great in admiration as herself, So shall she leave her blessedness to one, When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness, Who from the sacred ashes of her honor Shall starlike rise as great in fame as she was And so stand fixed.Peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,	 That were the servants to this chosen infant, Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him. Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine, His honor and the greatness of his name Shall be, and make new nations. He shall flourish, And like a mountain cedar reach his branches To all the plains about him. Our children’s children Shall see this and bless heaven. 

KING Thou speakest wonders. 

CRANMER She shall be to the happiness of England	 An agèd princess; many days shall see her, And yet no day without a deed to crown it. Would I had known no more! But she must die, She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin, A most unspotted lily, shall she pass	 To th’ ground, and all the world shall mourn her. 

KING O lord Archbishop, Thou hast made me now a man. Never before This happy child did I get anything.	 This oracle of comfort has so pleased me That when I am in heaven I shall desire To see what this child does and praise my Maker.— I thank you all.—To you, my good lord mayor And you, good brethren, I am much beholding.	 I have received much honor by your presence, And you shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords. You must all see the Queen, and she must thank you; She will be sick else. This day, no man think ’Has business at his house, for all shall stay.	 This little one shall make it holiday. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
