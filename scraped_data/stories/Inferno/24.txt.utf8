CANTO XXV. 

The robber,[649] when his words were ended so, Made both the figs and lifted either fist, Shouting: 'There, God! for them at thee I throw.' Then were the snakes my friends; for one 'gan twist And coiled itself around the sinner's throat, As if to say: 'Now would I have thee whist.' Another seized his arms and made a knot, Clinching itself upon them in such wise He had no power to move them by a jot. Pistoia! [650] thou, Pistoia, shouldst devise                      10 To burn thyself to ashes, since thou hast Outrun thy founders in iniquities. The blackest depths of Hell through which I passed Showed me no soul 'gainst God so filled with spite, No, not even he who down Thebes' wall[651] was cast. He spake no further word, but turned to flight; And I beheld a Centaur raging sore Come shouting: 'Of the ribald give me sight!' I scarce believe Maremma[652] yieldeth more Snakes of all kinds than what composed the load                 20 Which on his back, far as our form, he bore. Behind his nape, with pinions spread abroad, A dragon couchant on his shoulders lay To set on fire whoever bars his road. 

'This one is Cacus,'[653] did my Master say, 'Who underneath the rock of Aventine Watered a pool with blood day after day.Not with his brethren[654] runs he in the line, Because of yore the treacherous theft he wrought Upon the neighbouring wealthy herd of kine:                     30 Whence to his crooked course an end was brought 'Neath Hercules' club, which on him might shower down A hundred blows; ere ten he suffered nought.' While this he said, the other had passed on; And under us three spirits forward pressed Of whom my Guide and I had nothing known But that: 'Who are ye?' they made loud request. Whereon our tale[655] no further could proceed; And toward them wholly we our wits addressed. I recognised them not, but gave good heed;                        40 Till, as it often haps in such a case, To name another, one discovered need, Saying: 'Now where stopped Cianfa[656] in the race?' Then, that my Guide might halt and hearken well, On chin[657] and nose I did my finger place. If, Reader, to believe what now I tell Thou shouldst be slow, I wonder not, for I Who saw it all scarce find it credible. 

While I on them my brows kept lifted high A serpent, which had six feet, suddenly flew                    50 At one of them and held him bodily.Its middle feet about his paunch it drew, And with the two in front his arms clutched fast, And bit one cheek and the other through and through. Its hinder feet upon his thighs it cast, Thrusting its tail between them till behind, Distended o'er his reins, it upward passed. The ivy to a tree could never bind Itself so firmly as this dreadful beast Its members with the other's intertwined. 60 Each lost the colour that it once possessed, And closely they, like heated wax, unite, The former hue of neither manifest: Even so up o'er papyrus,[658] when alight, Before the flame there spreads a colour dun, Not black as yet, though from it dies the white. The other two meanwhile were looking on, Crying: 'Agnello, how art thou made new! Thou art not twain, and yet no longer one.' A single head was moulded out of two;                             70 And on our sight a single face arose, Which out of both lost countenances grew. 

Four separate limbs did but two arms compose; Belly with chest, and legs with thighs did grow To members such as nought created shows.Their former fashion was all perished now: The perverse shape did both, yet neither seem; And, thus transformed, departed moving slow. And as the lizard, which at fierce extreme Of dog-day heat another hedge would gain,                       80 Flits 'cross the path swift as the lightning's gleam; Right for the bellies of the other twain A little snake[659] quivering with anger sped, Livid and black as is a pepper grain, And on the part by which we first are fed Pierced one of them; and then upon the ground It fell before him, and remained outspread. The wounded gazed on it, but made no sound. Rooted he stood[660] and yawning, scarce awake, As seized by fever or by sleep profound. 90 It closely watched him and he watched the snake, While from its mouth and from his wound 'gan swell Volumes of smoke which joined one cloud to make. Be Lucan henceforth dumb, nor longer tell Of plagued Sabellus and Nassidius,[661] But, hearkening to what follows, mark it well. 

Silent be Ovid: of him telling us How Cadmus[662] to a snake, and to a fount Changed Arethuse,[663] I am not envious; For never of two natures front to front                          100 In metamorphosis, while mutually The forms[664] their matter changed, he gives account.'Twas thus that each to the other made reply: Its tail into a fork the serpent split; Bracing his feet the other pulled them nigh: And then in one so thoroughly were knit His legs and thighs, no searching could divine At where the junction had been wrought in it. The shape, of which the one lost every sign, The cloven tail was taking; then the skin                      110 Of one grew rough, the other's soft and fine. I by the armpits saw the arms drawn in; And now the monster's feet, which had been small, What the other's lost in length appeared to win. Together twisted, its hind feet did fall And grew the member men are used to hide: For his the wretch gained feet with which to crawl. Dyed in the smoke they took on either side A novel colour: hair unwonted grew On one; the hair upon the other died. 

120 The one fell prone, erect the other drew, With cruel eyes continuing to glare, 'Neath which their muzzles metamorphose knew.The erect to his brows drew his. Of stuff to spare Of what he upward pulled, there was no lack; So ears were formed on cheeks that erst were bare. Of that which clung in front nor was drawn back, Superfluous, on the face was formed a nose, And lips absorbed the skin that still was slack. His muzzle who lay prone now forward goes;                       130 Backward into his head his ears he draws Even as a snail appears its horns to lose. The tongue, which had been whole and ready was For speech, cleaves now; the forked tongue of the snake Joins in the other: and the smoke has pause. [665] The soul which thus a brutish form did take, Along the valley, hissing, swiftly fled; The other close behind it spluttering spake, Then, toward it turning his new shoulders, said Unto the third: 'Now Buoso down the way                        140 May hasten crawling, as I earlier sped.' Ballast which in the Seventh Bolgia lay Thus saw I shift and change. Be my excuse The novel theme,[666] if swerves my pen astray. 

And though these things mine eyesight might confuse A little, and my mind with fear divide, Such secrecy they fleeing could not use But that Puccio Sciancatto plain I spied; And he alone of the companions three Who came at first, was left unmodified.150 For the other, tears, Gaville,[667] are shed by thee.
