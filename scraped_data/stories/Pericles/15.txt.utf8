<ACTION>Enter Cerimon and Thaisa.</ACTION> 

CERIMON Madam, this letter and some certain jewels Lay with you in your coffer, which are At your command. Know you the character? <ACTION>He shows her the letter.</ACTION> 

THAISA It is my lord’s. That I was shipped at sea I well remember, even on my bearing time,	 But whether there delivered, by the holy gods I cannot rightly say. But since King Pericles, My wedded lord, I ne’er shall see again, A vestal livery will I take me to, And never more have joy.	 

CERIMON Madam, if this You purpose as you speak, Diana’s temple Is not distant far, where you may abide Till your date expire. Moreover, if you Please, a niece of mine shall there attend you.	 

THAISA My recompense is thanks, that’s all; Yet my good will is great, though the gift small. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
