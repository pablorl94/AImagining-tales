<ACTION>Enter Helen, Widow, and Diana.</ACTION> 

HELEN That you may well perceive I have not wronged you, One of the greatest in the Christian world Shall be my surety, ’fore whose throne ’tis needful, Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel. Time was, I did him a desirèd office	 Dear almost as his life, which gratitude Through flinty Tartar’s bosom would peep forth And answer thanks. I duly am informed His Grace is at Marseilles, to which place We have convenient convoy. You must know	 I am supposèd dead. The army breaking, My husband hies him home, where, heaven aiding And by the leave of my good lord the King, We’ll be before our welcome. 

WIDOW Gentle madam, You never had a servant to whose trust Your business was more welcome. 

HELEN Nor you, mistress, Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labor To recompense your love. Doubt not but heaven	 Hath brought me up to be your daughter’s dower, As it hath fated her to be my motive And helper to a husband. But O, strange men, That can such sweet use make of what they hate When saucy trusting of the cozened thoughts	 Defiles the pitchy night! So lust doth play With what it loathes for that which is away. But more of this hereafter.—You, Diana, Under my poor instructions yet must suffer Something in my behalf.	 

DIANA Let death and honesty Go with your impositions, I am yours Upon your will to suffer. 

HELEN Yet, I pray you— But with the word “The time will bring on summer,”	 When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns And be as sweet as sharp. We must away. Our wagon is prepared, and time revives us. All’s well that ends well. Still the fine’s the crown. Whate’er the course, the end is the renown.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
