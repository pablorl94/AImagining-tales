<ACTION>Enter Cloten and two Lords.</ACTION> 

FIRST LORD Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt. The violence of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice. Where air comes out, air comes in. There’s none abroad so wholesome as that you vent. 

CLOTEN If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I	 hurt him? 

SECOND LORD ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> No, faith, not so much as his patience. 

FIRST LORD Hurt him? His body’s a passable carcass if he be not hurt. It is a thoroughfare for steel if it be	 not hurt. 

SECOND LORD , aside  His steel was in debt; it went o’ th’ backside the town. 

CLOTEN The villain would not stand me. 

SECOND LORD ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> No, but he fled forward still,	 toward your face. 

FIRST LORD Stand you? You have land enough of your own, but he added to your having, gave you some ground. 

SECOND LORD ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> As many inches as you have	 oceans. Puppies! 

CLOTEN  I would they had not come between us. 

SECOND LORD ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> So would I, till you had measured how long a fool you were upon the ground. 

CLOTEN And that she should love this fellow and	 refuse me! 

SECOND LORD ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> If it be a sin to make a true election, she is damned. 

FIRST LORD Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain go not together. She’s a good sign, but I	 have seen small reflection of her wit. 

SECOND LORD ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> She shines not upon fools, lest the reflection should hurt her. 

CLOTEN Come, I’ll to my chamber. Would there had been some hurt done!	 

SECOND LORD ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> I wish not so, unless it had been the fall of an ass, which is no great hurt. 

CLOTEN   You’ll go with us? 

FIRST LORD I’ll attend your Lordship. 

CLOTEN  Nay, come, let’s go together.	 

SECOND LORD Well, my lord. <ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
