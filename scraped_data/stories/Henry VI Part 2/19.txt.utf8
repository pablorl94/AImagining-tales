KING HENRY Was ever king that joyed an earthly throne And could command no more content than I? No sooner was I crept out of my cradle But I was made a king at nine months old. Was never subject longed to be a king As I do long and wish to be a subject! 

<ACTION>Enter Buckingham and old Clifford.</ACTION> 

BUCKINGHAM Health and glad tidings to your Majesty! 

KING HENRY Why, Buckingham, is the traitor Cade surprised, Or is he but retired to make him strong? 

<ACTION>Enter below multitudes with halters about their necks.</ACTION> 

CLIFFORD He is fled, my lord, and all his powers do yield	 And, humbly thus, with halters on their necks, Expect your Highness’ doom of life or death. 

KING HENRY Then, heaven, set ope thy everlasting gates To entertain my vows of thanks and praise! Soldiers, this day have you redeemed your lives And showed how well you love your prince and country. Continue still in this so good a mind, And Henry, though he be infortunate, Assure yourselves, will never be unkind.	 And so with thanks and pardon to you all, I do dismiss you to your several countries. 

ALL  God save the King! God save the King! 

<ACTION>The multitudes exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter a Messenger.</ACTION> 

MESSENGER Please it your Grace to be advertisèd The Duke of York is newly come from Ireland	 And, with a puissant and a mighty power Of gallowglasses and stout kerns, Is marching hitherward in proud array, And still proclaimeth, as he comes along, His arms are only to remove from thee	 The Duke of Somerset, whom he terms a traitor. 

KING HENRY Thus stands my state, ’twixt Cade and York distressed, Like to a ship that, having scaped a tempest, Is straightway calmed and boarded with a pirate.	 But now is Cade driven back, his men dispersed, And now is York in arms to second him. I pray thee, Buckingham, go and meet him, And ask him what’s the reason of these arms. Tell him I’ll send Duke Edmund to the Tower.—	 And, Somerset, we will commit thee thither Until his army be dismissed from him. 

SOMERSET My lord, I’ll yield myself to prison willingly, Or unto death, to do my country good.	 

KING HENRY ,  <ACTION>to Buckingham</ACTION> In any case, be not too rough in terms, For he is fierce and cannot brook hard language. 

BUCKINGHAM I will, my lord, and doubt not so to deal As all things shall redound unto your good. 

KING HENRY Come, wife, let’s in, and learn to govern better,	 For yet may England curse my wretched reign. 

<ACTION>Flourish. They exit.</ACTION>
