<ACTION>Enter Buckingham, Lord Stanley, Earl of Derby,Hastings, Bishop of Ely, Norfolk, Ratcliffe, Lovell, withothers, at a table.</ACTION> 

HASTINGS Now, noble peers, the cause why we are met Is to determine of the coronation. In God’s name, speak. When is the royal day? 

BUCKINGHAM Is all things ready for the royal time? 

STANLEY It is, and wants but nomination. 

ELY Tomorrow, then, I judge a happy day. 

BUCKINGHAM Who knows the Lord Protector’s mind herein? Who is most inward with the noble duke? 

ELY Your Grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.	 

BUCKINGHAM We know each other’s faces; for our hearts, He knows no more of mine than I of yours, Or I of his, my lord, than you of mine.— Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love. 

HASTINGS I thank his Grace, I know he loves me well.	 But for his purpose in the coronation, I have not sounded him, nor he delivered His gracious pleasure any way therein. But you, my honorable lords, may name the time, And in the Duke’s behalf I’ll give my voice, Which I presume he’ll take in gentle part. 

<ACTION>Enter Richard, Duke of Gloucester.</ACTION> 

ELY In happy time here comes the Duke himself. 

RICHARD My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow. I have been long a sleeper; but I trust My absence doth neglect no great design Which by my presence might have been concluded. 

BUCKINGHAM Had you not come upon your cue, my lord, William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part— I mean your voice for crowning of the King. 

RICHARD Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder.	 His Lordship knows me well and loves me well.— My lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn I saw good strawberries in your garden there; I do beseech you, send for some of them. 

ELY Marry and will, my lord, with all my heart.	 

<ACTION>Exit Bishop of Ely.</ACTION> 

RICHARD Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you. 

<ACTION>They move aside.</ACTION> 

Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business And finds the testy gentleman so hot That he will lose his head ere give consent His master’s child, as worshipfully he terms it,	 Shall lose the royalty of England’s throne. 

BUCKINGHAM Withdraw yourself awhile. I’ll go with you. 

<ACTION>Richard and Buckingham exit.</ACTION> 

STANLEY We have not yet set down this day of triumph. Tomorrow, in my judgment, is too sudden, For I myself am not so well provided	 As else I would be, were the day prolonged. 

<ACTION>Enter the Bishop of Ely.</ACTION> 

ELY Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester? I have sent for these strawberries. 

HASTINGS His Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning.	 There’s some conceit or other likes him well When that he bids good morrow with such spirit. I think there’s never a man in Christendom Can lesser hide his love or hate than he, For by his face straight shall you know his heart.	 

STANLEY What of his heart perceive you in his face By any livelihood he showed today? 

HASTINGS Marry, that with no man here he is offended, For were he, he had shown it in his looks. 

<ACTION>Enter Richard and Buckingham.</ACTION> 

RICHARD I pray you all, tell me what they deserve	 That do conspire my death with devilish plots Of damnèd witchcraft, and that have prevailed Upon my body with their hellish charms? 

HASTINGS The tender love I bear your Grace, my lord, Makes me most forward in this princely presence	 To doom th’ offenders, whosoe’er they be. I say, my lord, they have deservèd death. 

RICHARD Then be your eyes the witness of their evil. 

<ACTION>He shows his arm.</ACTION> 

Look how I am bewitched! Behold mine arm Is like a blasted sapling withered up;	 And this is Edward’s wife, that monstrous witch, Consorted with that harlot, strumpet Shore, That by their witchcraft thus have markèd me. 

HASTINGS If they have done this deed, my noble lord— 

RICHARD If? Thou protector of this damnèd strumpet,	 Talk’st thou to me of “ifs”? Thou art a traitor.— Off with his head. Now by Saint Paul I swear I will not dine until I see the same.— Lovell and Ratcliffe, look that it be done.— The rest that love me, rise and follow me. 

<ACTION>They exit. Lovell and Ratcliffe remain,with the Lord Hastings.</ACTION> 

HASTINGS Woe, woe for England! Not a whit for me, For I, too fond, might have prevented this. Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm, And I did scorn it and disdain to fly. Three times today my foot-cloth horse did stumble,	 And started when he looked upon the Tower, As loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse. O, now I need the priest that spake to me! I now repent I told the pursuivant, As too triumphing, how mine enemies	 Today at Pomfret bloodily were butchered, And I myself secure in grace and favor. O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse Is lighted on poor Hastings’ wretched head. 

RATCLIFFE Come, come, dispatch. The Duke would be at	 dinner. Make a short shrift. He longs to see your head. 

HASTINGS O momentary grace of mortal men, Which we more hunt for than the grace of God! Who builds his hope in air of your good looks	 Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast, Ready with every nod to tumble down Into the fatal bowels of the deep. 

LOVELL Come, come, dispatch. ’Tis bootless to exclaim. 

HASTINGS O bloody Richard! Miserable England,	 I prophesy the fearfull’st time to thee That ever wretched age hath looked upon.— Come, lead me to the block. Bear him my head. They smile at me who shortly shall be dead. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
