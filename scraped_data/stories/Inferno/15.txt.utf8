CANTO XVI. 

Now could I hear the water as it fell To the next circle[479] with a murmuring sound Like what is heard from swarming hives to swell; When three shades all together with a bound Burst from a troop met by us pressing on 'Neath rain of that sharp torment. O'er the ground Toward us approaching, they exclaimed each one: 'Halt thou, whom from thy garb[480] we judge to be A citizen of our corrupted town.' Alas, what scars I on their limbs did see,                        10 Both old and recent, which the flames had made: Even now my ruth is fed by memory. My Teacher halted at their cry, and said: 'Await a while:' and looked me in the face; 'Some courtesy to these were well displayed. And but that fire--the manner of the place-- Descends for ever, fitting 'twere to find Rather than them, thee quickening thy pace.' When we had halted, they again combined In their old song; and, reaching where we stood,                20 Into a wheel all three were intertwined. 

And as the athletes used, well oiled and nude, To feel their grip and, wary, watch their chance, Ere they to purpose strike and wrestle could; So each of them kept fixed on me his glance As he wheeled round,[481] and in opposing ways His neck and feet seemed ever to advance.'Ah, if the misery of this sand-strewn place Bring us and our petitions in despite,' One then began, 'and flayed and grimy face;                     30 Let at the least our fame goodwill incite To tell us who thou art, whose living feet Thus through Inferno wander without fright. For he whose footprints, as thou see'st, I beat, Though now he goes with body peeled and nude, More than thou thinkest, in the world was great. The grandson was he of Gualdrada good; He, Guidoguerra,[482] with his armèd hand Did mighty things, and by his counsel shrewd. The other who behind me treads the sand                           40 Is one whose name should on the earth be dear; For he is Tegghiaio[483] Aldobrand. And I, who am tormented with them here, James Rusticucci[484] was; my fierce and proud Wife of my ruin was chief minister.' 

If from the fire there had been any shroud I should have leaped down 'mong them, nor have earned Blame, for my Teacher sure had this allowed.But since I should have been all baked and burned, Terror prevailed the goodwill to restrain                       50 With which to clasp them in my arms I yearned. Then I began: ''Twas not contempt but pain Which your condition in my breast awoke, Where deeply rooted it will long remain, When this my Master words unto me spoke, By which expectancy was in me stirred That ye who came were honourable folk. I of your city[485] am, and with my word Your deeds and honoured names oft to recall Delighted, and with joy of them I heard. 60 To the sweet fruits I go, and leave the gall, As promised to me by my Escort true; But first I to the centre down must fall.' 'So may thy soul thy members long endue With vital power,' the other made reply, 'And after thee thy fame[486] its light renew; As thou shalt tell if worth and courtesy Within our city as of yore remain, Or from it have been wholly forced to fly. 

For William Borsier,[487] one of yonder train,                    70 And but of late joined with us in this woe, Causeth us with his words exceeding pain.''Upstarts, and fortunes suddenly that grow, Have bred in thee pride and extravagance,[488] Whence tears, O Florence! thou art shedding now.' Thus cried I with uplifted countenance. The three, accepting it for a reply, Glanced each at each as hearing truth men glance. And all: 'If others thou shalt satisfy As well at other times[489] at no more cost,                    80 Happy thus at thine ease the truth to cry! Therefore if thou escap'st these regions lost, Returning to behold the starlight fair, Then when "There was I,"[490] thou shalt make thy boast, Something of us do thou 'mong men declare.' Then broken was the wheel, and as they fled Their nimble legs like pinions beat the air. So much as one _Amen!_ had scarce been said Quicker than what they vanished from our view. On this once more the way my Master led. 90 I followed, and ere long so near we drew To where the water fell, that for its roar Speech scarcely had been heard between us two. 

And as the stream which of all those which pour East (from Mount Viso counting) by its own Course falls the first from Apennine to shore-- As Acquacheta[491] in the uplands known By name, ere plunging to its bed profound; Name lost ere by Forlì its waters run-- Above St. Benedict with one long bound,                          100 Where for a thousand[492] would be ample room, Falls from the mountain to the lower ground; Down the steep cliff that water dyed in gloom We found to fall echoing from side to side, Stunning the ear with its tremendous boom.There was a cord about my middle tied, With which I once had thought that I might hold Secure the leopard with the painted hide. When this from round me I had quite unrolled To him I handed it, all coiled and tight;                      110 As by my Leader I had first been told. Himself then bending somewhat toward the right,[493] He just beyond the edge of the abyss Threw down the cord,[494] which disappeared from sight. 'That some strange thing will follow upon this Unwonted signal which my Master's eye Thus follows,' so I thought, 'can hardly miss.' 

Ah, what great caution need we standing by Those who behold not only what is done, But who have wit our hidden thoughts to spy!120 He said to me: 'There shall emerge, and soon, What I await; and quickly to thy view That which thou dream'st of shall be clearly known. '[495] From utterance of truth which seems untrue A man, whene'er he can, should guard his tongue; Lest he win blame to no transgression due. Yet now I must speak out, and by the song Of this my Comedy, Reader, I swear-- So in good liking may it last full long!-- I saw a shape swim upward through that air. 130 All indistinct with gross obscurity, Enough to fill the stoutest heart with fear: Like one who rises having dived to free An anchor grappled on a jagged stone, Or something else deep hidden in the sea; With feet drawn in and arms all open thrown.
