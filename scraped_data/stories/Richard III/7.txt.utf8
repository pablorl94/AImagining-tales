<ACTION>Enter Archbishop, the young Duke of York,Queen Elizabeth, and the Duchess of York.</ACTION> 

ARCHBISHOP Last night, I hear, they lay at Stony Stratford, And at Northampton they do rest tonight. Tomorrow or next day they will be here. 

DUCHESS I long with all my heart to see the Prince. I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.	 

QUEEN ELIZABETH But I hear no; they say my son of York Has almost overta’en him in his growth. 

YORK Ay, mother, but I would not have it so. 

DUCHESS Why, my good cousin? It is good to grow. 

YORK Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper,	 My uncle Rivers talked how I did grow More than my brother. “Ay,” quoth my uncle Gloucester, “Small herbs have grace; great weeds do grow apace.”	 And since, methinks I would not grow so fast Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste. 

DUCHESS Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold In him that did object the same to thee! He was the wretched’st thing when he was young, So long a-growing and so leisurely, That if his rule were true, he should be gracious. 

YORK And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam. 

DUCHESS I hope he is, but yet let mothers doubt.	 

YORK Now, by my troth, if I had been remembered, I could have given my uncle’s Grace a flout To touch his growth nearer than he touched mine. 

DUCHESS How, my young York? I prithee let me hear it. 

YORK Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast	 That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old. ’Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth. Grandam, this would have been a biting jest. 

DUCHESS I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this? 

YORK Grandam, his nurse.	 

DUCHESS His nurse? Why, she was dead ere thou wast born. 

YORK If ’twere not she, I cannot tell who told me. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH A parlous boy! Go to, you are too shrewd. 

DUCHESS Good madam, be not angry with the child. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH Pitchers have ears.	 

<ACTION>Enter a Messenger.</ACTION> 

ARCHBISHOP Here comes a messenger.—What news? 

MESSENGER Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH How doth the Prince? 

MESSENGER Well, madam, and in health. 

DUCHESS  What is thy news?	 

MESSENGER Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret, And, with them, Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners. 

DUCHESS Who hath committed them? 

MESSENGER The mighty dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham. 

ARCHBISHOP For what offense?	 

MESSENGER The sum of all I can, I have disclosed. Why, or for what, the nobles were committed Is all unknown to me, my gracious lord. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH Ay me! I see the ruin of my house. The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind.	 Insulting tyranny begins to jut Upon the innocent and aweless throne. Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre. I see, as in a map, the end of all. 

DUCHESS Accursèd and unquiet wrangling days,	 How many of you have mine eyes beheld? My husband lost his life to get the crown, And often up and down my sons were tossed For me to joy, and weep, their gain and loss. And being seated, and domestic broils	 Clean overblown, themselves the conquerors Make war upon themselves, brother to brother, Blood to blood, self against self. O, preposterous And frantic outrage, end thy damnèd spleen, Or let me die, to look on Earth no more.	 

QUEEN ELIZABETH , <ACTION> to York</ACTION> Come, come, my boy. We will to sanctuary.— Madam, farewell. 

DUCHESS   Stay, I will go with you. 

QUEEN ELIZABETH You have no cause. 

ARCHBISHOP ,  <ACTION>to Queen Elizabeth </ACTION> My gracious lady, go,	 And thither bear your treasure and your goods. For my part, I’ll resign unto your Grace The seal I keep; and so betide to me As well I tender you and all of yours. Go. I’ll conduct you to the sanctuary.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
