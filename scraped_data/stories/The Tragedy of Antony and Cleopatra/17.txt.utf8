<ACTION>Enter Agrippa, Maecenas, and Caesar.</ACTION> 

CAESAR Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more In Alexandria. Here’s the manner of ’t: I’ th’ marketplace, on a tribunal silvered, Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold Were publicly enthroned. At the feet sat	 Caesarion, whom they call my father’s son, And all the unlawful issue that their lust Since then hath made between them. Unto her He gave the stablishment of Egypt, made her Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,	 Absolute queen. 

MAECENAS This in the public eye? 

CAESAR I’ th’ common showplace where they exercise. His sons he there proclaimed the kings of kings. Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia	 He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assigned Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia. She In th’ habiliments of the goddess Isis That day appeared, and oft before gave audience, As ’tis reported, so.    

MAECENAS Let Rome be thus informed. 

AGRIPPA Who, queasy with his insolence already, Will their good thoughts call from him. 

CAESAR The people knows it and have now received His accusations.	 

AGRIPPA Who does he accuse? 

CAESAR Caesar, and that, having in Sicily Sextus Pompeius spoiled, we had not rated him His part o’ th’ isle. Then does he say he lent me Some shipping, unrestored. Lastly, he frets	 That Lepidus of the triumvirate Should be deposed and, being, that we detain All his revenue. 

AGRIPPA Sir, this should be answered. 

CAESAR ’Tis done already, and the messenger gone.	 I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel, That he his high authority abused And did deserve his change. For what I have conquered, I grant him part; but then in his Armenia	 And other of his conquered kingdoms I Demand the like. 

MAECENAS He’ll never yield to that. 

CAESAR Nor must not then be yielded to in this. 

<ACTION>Enter Octavia with her Train.</ACTION> 

OCTAVIA Hail, Caesar, and my lord! Hail, most dear Caesar.	 

CAESAR That ever I should call thee castaway! 

OCTAVIA You have not called me so, nor have you cause. 

CAESAR Why have you stol’n upon us thus? You come not Like Caesar’s sister. The wife of Antony Should have an army for an usher and	 The neighs of horse to tell of her approach Long ere she did appear. The trees by th’ way Should have borne men, and expectation fainted, Longing for what it had not. Nay, the dust Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,	 Raised by your populous troops. But you are come A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown, Is often left unloved. We should have met you By sea and land, supplying every stage	 With an augmented greeting. 

OCTAVIA Good my lord, To come thus was I not constrained, but did it On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony, Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted	 My grievèd ear withal, whereon I begged His pardon for return. 

CAESAR Which soon he granted, Being an abstract ’tween his lust and him. 

OCTAVIA Do not say so, my lord.	 

CAESAR I have eyes upon him, And his affairs come to me on the wind. Where is he now? 

OCTAVIA My lord, in Athens. 

CAESAR No, my most wrongèd sister. Cleopatra	 Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire Up to a whore, who now are levying The kings o’ th’ Earth for war. He hath assembled Bocchus, the King of Libya; Archelaus Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, King	 Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas; King Manchus of Arabia; King of Pont; Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, King Of Comagen; Polemon and Amyntas, The Kings of Mede and Lycaonia,	 With a more larger list of scepters. 

OCTAVIA Ay me, most wretched, That have my heart parted betwixt two friends That does afflict each other! 

CAESAR  Welcome hither.	 Your letters did withhold our breaking forth Till we perceived both how you were wrong led And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart. Be you not troubled with the time, which drives O’er your content these strong necessities,	 But let determined things to destiny Hold unbewailed their way. Welcome to Rome, Nothing more dear to me. You are abused Beyond the mark of thought, and the high gods, To do you justice, makes his ministers	 Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort, And ever welcome to us. 

AGRIPPA  Welcome, lady. 

MAECENAS Welcome, dear madam. Each heart in Rome does love and pity you;	 Only th’ adulterous Antony, most large In his abominations, turns you off And gives his potent regiment to a trull That noises it against us. 

OCTAVIA , to Caesar  Is it so, sir?	 

CAESAR Most certain. Sister, welcome. Pray you Be ever known to patience. My dear’st sister! 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
