SCENE V.--HARPAGON, CLÃ‰ANTE. 

CLE. I beg your pardon, father, for having been angry. 

HAR. It is nothing. 

CLE. I assure you that I feel very sorry about it. 

HAR. I am very happy to see you reasonable again. 

CLE. How very kind of you so soon to forget my fault. 

HAR. One easily forgets the faults of children when they return to their duty. 

CLE. What! you are not angry with me for my extravagant behaviour? 

HAR. By your submission and respectful conduct you compel me to forget my anger. 

CLE. I assure you, father, I shall for ever keep in heart the remembrance of all your kindness. 

HAR. And I promise you that, in future, you will obtain all you like from me. 

CLE. Oh, father! I ask nothing more; it is sufficient for me that you give me Marianne. 

HAR. What? 

CLE. I say, father, that I am only too thankful already for what you have done, and that when you give me Marianne, you give me everything. 

HAR. Who talks of giving you Marianne? 

CLE. You, father. 

HAR. I? 

CLE. Yes. 

HAR. What! is it not you who promised to give her up? 

CLE. I! give her up? 

HAR. Yes. 

CLE. Certainly not. 

HAR. Did you not give up all pretensions to her? 

CLE. On the contrary, I am more determined than ever to have her. 

HAR. What, scoundrel! again? 

CLE. Nothing can make me change my mind. 

HAR. Let me get at you again, wretch! 

CLE. You can do as you please. 

HAR. I forbid you ever to come within my sight. 

CLE. As you like. 

HAR. I abandon you. 

CLE. Abandon me. 

HAR. I disown you. 

CLE. Disown me. 

HAR. I disinherit you. 

CLE. As you will. 

HAR. I give you my curse. 

CLE. I want none of your gifts.
