Chapter 3.LV. 

When my uncle Toby had turned every thing into money, and settled all accounts betwixt the agent of the regiment and Le Fever, and betwixt Le Fever and all mankind,--there remained nothing more in my uncle Toby's hands, than an old regimental coat and a sword; so that my uncle Toby found little or no opposition from the world in taking administration. The coat my uncle Toby gave the corporal;--Wear it, Trim, said my uncle Toby, as long as it will hold together, for the sake of the poor lieutenant--And this,--said my uncle Toby, taking up the sword in his hand, and drawing it out of the scabbard as he spoke--and this, Le Fever, I'll save for thee,--'tis all the fortune, continued my uncle Toby, hanging it up upon a crook, and pointing to it,--'tis all the fortune, my dear Le Fever, which God has left thee; but if he has given thee a heart to fight thy way with it in the world,--and thou doest it like a man of honour,--'tis enough for us. 

As soon as my uncle Toby had laid a foundation, and taught him to inscribe a regular polygon in a circle, he sent him to a public school, where, excepting Whitsontide and Christmas, at which times the corporal was punctually dispatched for him,--he remained to the spring of the year, seventeen; when the stories of the emperor's sending his army into Hungary against the Turks, kindling a spark of fire in his bosom, he left his Greek and Latin without leave, and throwing himself upon his knees before my uncle Toby, begged his father's sword, and my uncle Toby's leave along with it, to go and try his fortune under Eugene.--Twice did my uncle Toby forget his wound and cry out, Le Fever! I will go with thee, and thou shalt fight beside me--And twice he laid his hand upon his groin, and hung down his head in sorrow and disconsolation.-- 

My uncle Toby took down the sword from the crook, where it had hung untouched ever since the lieutenant's death, and delivered it to the corporal to brighten up;--and having detained Le Fever a single fortnight to equip him, and contract for his passage to Leghorn,--he put the sword into his hand.--If thou art brave, Le Fever, said my uncle Toby, this will not fail thee,--but Fortune, said he (musing a little),--Fortune may--And if she does,--added my uncle Toby, embracing him, come back again to me, Le Fever, and we will shape thee another course. 

The greatest injury could not have oppressed the heart of Le Fever more than my uncle Toby's paternal kindness;--he parted from my uncle Toby, as the best of sons from the best of fathers--both dropped tears--and as my uncle Toby gave him his last kiss, he slipped sixty guineas, tied up in an old purse of his father's, in which was his mother's ring, into his hand,--and bid God bless him.
