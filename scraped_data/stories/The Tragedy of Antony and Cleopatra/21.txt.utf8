<ACTION>Canidius marcheth with his land army one wayover the stage, and Taurus the lieutenant of Caesarthe other way. After their going in is heard thenoise of a sea fight.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Alarum. Enter Enobarbus.</ACTION> 

ENOBARBUS Naught, naught, all naught! I can behold no longer. Th’ Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral, With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder. To see ’t mine eyes are blasted. 

SCARUS Gods and goddesses,	 All the whole synod of them! 

ENOBARBUS What’s thy passion? 

SCARUS The greater cantle of the world is lost With very ignorance. We have kissed away Kingdoms and provinces.	 

ENOBARBUS How appears the fight? 

SCARUS On our side, like the tokened pestilence, Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt, Whom leprosy o’ertake, i’ th’ midst o’ th’ fight, When vantage like a pair of twins appeared	 Both as the same—or, rather, ours the elder— The breeze upon her like a cow in June, Hoists sails and flies. 

ENOBARBUS  That I beheld. Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not	 Endure a further view. 

SCARUS She once being loofed, The noble ruin of her magic, Antony, Claps on his sea-wing and, like a doting mallard, Leaving the fight in height, flies after her.	 I never saw an action of such shame. Experience, manhood, honor ne’er before Did violate so itself. 

ENOBARBUS Alack, alack. 

<ACTION>Enter Canidius.</ACTION> 

CANIDIUS Our fortune on the sea is out of breath	 And sinks most lamentably. Had our general Been what he knew himself, it had gone well. O, he has given example for our flight Most grossly by his own. 

ENOBARBUS Ay, are you thereabouts? Why then goodnight	 indeed. 

CANIDIUS Toward Peloponnesus are they fled. 

SCARUS ’Tis easy to ’t, and there I will attend What further comes.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

CANIDIUS To Caesar will I render	 My legions and my horse. Six kings already Show me the way of yielding.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

ENOBARBUS I’ll yet follow The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason Sits in the wind against me.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
