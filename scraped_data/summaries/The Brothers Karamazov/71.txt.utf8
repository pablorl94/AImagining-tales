When Alyosha arrives, Lise is also a nervous wreck. She tells him that she craves "disorder," that she wants to suffer. She also tells him that Kalganov has even proposed to her.

Lise tells him that she has horrible dreams involving tiny devils infesting her closets. Alyosha admits that he has had the same dream. (Whoa.)

She also dreams that a – prepare yourself for ugly anti-Semitism here – Jew is torturing a small child while she eats pineapple compote.

Alyosha is surprised to learn that Lise actually invited Ivan and talked to him about her dream. Ivan had laughed at her and left.

Lise passes Alyosha a note to give to Ivan. When he leaves, she slams the door on her own finger.
