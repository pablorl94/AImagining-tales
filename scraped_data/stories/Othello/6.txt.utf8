<ACTION>Enter Cassio with Musicians.</ACTION> 

CASSIO Masters, play here (I will content your pains) Something that’s brief; and bid “Good morrow, general.”	 <ACTION>They play.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter the Clown.</ACTION> 

CLOWN Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that they speak i’ th’ nose thus?	 

MUSICIAN How, sir, how? 

CLOWN Are these, I pray you, wind instruments? 

MUSICIAN Ay, marry, are they, sir. 

CLOWN O, thereby hangs a tail. 

MUSICIAN Whereby hangs a tale, sir?	 

CLOWN Marry, sir, by many a wind instrument that I know. But, masters, here’s money for you; and the General so likes your music that he desires you, for love’s sake, to make no more noise with it. 

MUSICIAN Well, sir, we will not.	 

CLOWN If you have any music that may not be heard, to ’t again. But, as they say, to hear music the General does not greatly care. 

MUSICIAN We have none such, sir. 

CLOWN Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I’ll	 away. Go, vanish into air, away! 

<ACTION>Musicians exit.</ACTION> 

CASSIO Dost thou hear, mine honest friend? 

CLOWN No, I hear not your honest friend. I hear you. 

CASSIO Prithee, keep up thy quillets.	 <ACTION>Giving money.</ACTION> There’s a poor piece of gold for thee. If the gentlewoman	 that attends the General’s wife be stirring, tell her there’s one Cassio entreats her a little favor of speech. Wilt thou do this? 

CLOWN She is stirring, sir. If she will stir hither, I shall seem to notify unto her.	 

CASSIO Do, good my friend.	 

<ACTION>Clown exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Iago.</ACTION> 

In happy time, Iago. 

IAGO You have not been abed, then? 

CASSIO Why, no. The day had broke Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,	 To send in to your wife. My suit to her Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access. 

IAGO I’ll send her to you presently, And I’ll devise a mean to draw the Moor	 Out of the way, that your converse and business May be more free. 

CASSIO I humbly thank you for ’t.  <ACTION>Iago exits. </ACTION> I never knew A Florentine more kind and honest.	 

<ACTION>Enter Emilia.</ACTION> 

EMILIA Good morrow, good lieutenant. I am sorry For your displeasure, but all will sure be well. The General and his wife are talking of it, And she speaks for you stoutly. The Moor replies That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus	 And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom He might not but refuse you. But he protests he loves you And needs no other suitor but his likings To take the safest occasion by the front	 To bring you in again. 

CASSIO  Yet I beseech you, If you think fit, or that it may be done, Give me advantage of some brief discourse With Desdemon alone.	 

EMILIA Pray you come in. I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely. 

CASSIO I am much bound to you. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
