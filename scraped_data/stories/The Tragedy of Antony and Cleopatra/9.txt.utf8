<ACTION>Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, and Alexas.</ACTION> 

CLEOPATRA Give me some music—music, moody food Of us that trade in love. ALL  The music, ho! 

<ACTION>Enter Mardian the eunuch.</ACTION> 

CLEOPATRA Let it alone. Let’s to billiards. Come, Charmian. 

CHARMIAN My arm is sore. Best play with Mardian.	 

CLEOPATRA As well a woman with an eunuch played As with a woman.—Come, you’ll play with me, sir? 

MARDIAN As well as I can, madam. 

CLEOPATRA And when good will is showed, though ’t come too short,	 The actor may plead pardon. I’ll none now. Give me mine angle; we’ll to th’ river. There, My music playing far off, I will betray Tawny-finned fishes. My bended hook shall pierce Their slimy jaws, and as I draw them up	 I’ll think them every one an Antony And say “Aha! You’re caught.” 

CHARMIAN ’Twas merry when You wagered on your angling; when your diver Did hang a salt fish on his hook, which he	 With fervency drew up. 

CLEOPATRA That time?—O, times!— I laughed him out of patience; and that night I laughed him into patience; and next morn, Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed,	 Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst I wore his sword Philippan. 

<ACTION>Enter a Messenger.</ACTION> 

O, from Italy! Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears, That long time have been barren.	 

MESSENGER Madam, madam— 

CLEOPATRA Antonio’s dead! If thou say so, villain, Thou kill’st thy mistress. But well and free, If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here My bluest veins to kiss, a hand that kings	 Have lipped and trembled kissing. 

MESSENGER First, madam, he is well. 

CLEOPATRA Why, there’s more gold. But sirrah, mark, we use To say the dead are well. Bring it to that, The gold I give thee will I melt and pour	 Down thy ill-uttering throat. 

MESSENGER Good madam, hear me. 

CLEOPATRA Well, go to, I will. But there’s no goodness in thy face—if Antony Be free and healthful, so tart a favor	 To trumpet such good tidings! If not well, Thou shouldst come like a Fury crowned with snakes, Not like a formal man. 

MESSENGER Will ’t please you hear me? 

CLEOPATRA I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak’st	 Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well, Or friends with Caesar or not captive to him, I’ll set thee in a shower of gold and hail Rich pearls upon thee. 

MESSENGER  Madam, he’s well.	 

CLEOPATRA Well said. 

MESSENGER And friends with Caesar. 

CLEOPATRA  Th’ art an honest man. 

MESSENGER Caesar and he are greater friends than ever. 

CLEOPATRA Make thee a fortune from me.	 

MESSENGER But yet, madam— 

CLEOPATRA I do not like “But yet.” It does allay The good precedence. Fie upon “But yet.” “But yet” is as a jailer to bring forth Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,	 Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear, The good and bad together: he’s friends with Caesar, In state of health, thou say’st, and, thou say’st, free. 

MESSENGER Free, madam, no. I made no such report. He’s bound unto Octavia.	 

CLEOPATRA For what good turn? 

MESSENGER For the best turn i’ th’ bed. 

CLEOPATRA I am pale, Charmian. 

MESSENGER Madam, he’s married to Octavia. 

CLEOPATRA The most infectious pestilence upon thee!	 

<ACTION>Strikes him down.</ACTION> 

MESSENGER Good madam, patience! 

CLEOPATRA What say you?	 <ACTION>Strikes him.</ACTION> Hence, horrible villain, or I’ll spurn thine eyes Like balls before me! I’ll unhair thy head! <ACTION>She hales him up and down.</ACTION> Thou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in	80 brine, Smarting in ling’ring pickle. 

MESSENGER Gracious madam, I that do bring the news made not the match. 

CLEOPATRA Say ’tis not so, a province I will give thee	 And make thy fortunes proud. The blow thou hadst Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage, And I will boot thee with what gift beside Thy modesty can beg. 

MESSENGER He’s married, madam.	 

CLEOPATRA Rogue, thou hast lived too long.	 <ACTION>Draw a knife.</ACTION> 

MESSENGER Nay then, I’ll run. What mean you, madam? I have made no fault. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

CHARMIAN Good madam, keep yourself within yourself. The man is innocent.	 

CLEOPATRA Some innocents ’scape not the thunderbolt. Melt Egypt into Nile, and kindly creatures Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again. Though I am mad, I will not bite him. Call! 

CHARMIAN He is afeard to come.	 

CLEOPATRA I will not hurt him. These hands do lack nobility that they strike A meaner than myself, since I myself Have given myself the cause. 

<ACTION>Enter the Messenger again.</ACTION> 

Come hither, sir.	 Though it be honest, it is never good To bring bad news. Give to a gracious message An host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell Themselves when they be felt. 

MESSENGER I have done my duty.	 

CLEOPATRA Is he married? I cannot hate thee worser than I do If thou again say “yes.” 

MESSENGER He’s married, madam. 

CLEOPATRA The gods confound thee! Dost thou hold there still?	 

MESSENGER Should I lie, madam? 

CLEOPATRA  O, I would thou didst, So half my Egypt were submerged and made A cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence. Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me	 Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married? 

MESSENGER I crave your Highness’ pardon. 

CLEOPATRA He is married? 

MESSENGER Take no offense that I would not offend you. To punish me for what you make me do	 Seems much unequal. He’s married to Octavia. 

CLEOPATRA O, that his fault should make a knave of thee That art not what th’ art sure of! Get thee hence. The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome	 Are all too dear for me. Lie they upon thy hand, And be undone by ’em!	 

<ACTION>Messenger exits.</ACTION> 

CHARMIAN Good your Highness, patience. 

CLEOPATRA In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.	 

CHARMIAN  Many times, madam. 

CLEOPATRA I am paid for ’t now. Lead me from hence; I faint. O, Iras, Charmian! ’Tis no matter.— Go to the fellow, good Alexas. Bid him Report the feature of Octavia, her years,	 Her inclination; let him not leave out The color of her hair. Bring me word quickly. 

<ACTION>Alexas exits.</ACTION> 

Let him forever go—let him not, Charmian. Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon, The other way ’s a Mars. (To Mardian.) Bid you	 Alexas Bring me word how tall she is.—Pity me, Charmian, But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
