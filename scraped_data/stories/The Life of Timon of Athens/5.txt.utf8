<ACTION>Enter Lucius, with three Strangers.</ACTION> 

LUCIUS Who, the Lord Timon? He is my very good friend and an honorable gentleman. 

FIRST STRANGER  We know him for no less, though we are but strangers to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and which I hear from common rumors: now Lord Timon’s happy hours are done and past, and his estate shrinks from him. 

LUCIUS Fie, no, do not believe it. He cannot want for money. 

SECOND STRANGER But believe you this, my lord, that	 not long ago one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow fifty talents, nay, urged extremely for ’t, and showed what necessity belonged to ’t, and yet was denied. 

LUCIUS  How?	 

SECOND STRANGER I tell you, denied, my lord. 

LUCIUS What a strange case was that! Now, before the gods, I am ashamed on ’t. Denied that honorable man? There was very little honor showed in ’t. For my own part, I must needs confess I have received	 some small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels, and suchlike trifles, nothing comparing to his; yet had he mistook him and sent to me, I should ne’er have denied his occasion fifty talents. 

<ACTION>Enter Servilius.</ACTION> 

SERVILIUS ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> See, by good hap, yonder’s my lord.	 I have sweat to see his Honor.  <ACTION>To Lucius.</ACTION> My honored lord. 

LUCIUS Servilius. You are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well. Commend me to thy honorable virtuous lord, my very exquisite friend.	 

<ACTION>He turns to exit.</ACTION> 

SERVILIUS May it please your Honor, my lord hath sent— 

LUCIUS  Ha! What has he sent? I am so much endeared to that lord; he’s ever sending. How shall I thank him, think’st thou? And what has he sent now?	 

SERVILIUS Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord, requesting your Lordship to supply his instant use with fifty talents. 

LUCIUS I know his Lordship is but merry with me. He cannot want fifty-five hundred talents.	 

SERVILIUS But in the meantime he wants less, my lord. If his occasion were not virtuous, I should not urge it half so faithfully. 

LUCIUS Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius? 

SERVILIUS Upon my soul, ’tis true, sir.	 

LUCIUS What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such a good time, when I might ha’ shown myself honorable! How unluckily it happened that I should purchase the day before for a little part, and undo a great deal of honor! Servilius,	 now before the gods, I am not able to do—the more beast, I say!—I was sending to use Lord Timon myself, these gentlemen can witness; but I would not for the wealth of Athens I had done ’t now. Commend me bountifully to his good Lordship,	 and I hope his Honor will conceive the fairest of me, because I have no power to be kind. And tell him this from me: I count it one of my greatest afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an honorable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you	 befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him? 

SERVILIUS Yes, sir, I shall. 

LUCIUS I’ll look you out a good turn, Servilius. 

<ACTION>Servilius exits.</ACTION> 

True, as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed,	 And he that’s once denied will hardly speed. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

FIRST STRANGER Do you observe this, Hostilius? 

SECOND STRANGER Ay, too well. 

FIRST STRANGER Why, this is the world’s soul, and just of the same piece	 Is every flatterer’s sport. Who can call him his friend That dips in the same dish? For, in my knowing, Timon has been this lord’s father And kept his credit with his purse, Supported his estate, nay, Timon’s money	 Has paid his men their wages. He ne’er drinks But Timon’s silver treads upon his lip. And yet—O, see the monstrousness of man When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!— He does deny him, in respect of his,	 What charitable men afford to beggars. 

THIRD STRANGER Religion groans at it. 

FIRST STRANGER  For mine own part, I never tasted Timon in my life, Nor came any of his bounties over me	 To mark me for his friend. Yet I protest, For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue, And honorable carriage, Had his necessity made use of me, I would have put my wealth into donation,	 And the best half should have returned to him, So much I love his heart. But I perceive Men must learn now with pity to dispense, For policy sits above conscience. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
