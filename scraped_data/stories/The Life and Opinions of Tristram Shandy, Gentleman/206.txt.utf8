Chapter 3.LXXXIX. 

--But courage! gentle reader!--I scorn it--'tis enough to have thee in my power--but to make use of the advantage which the fortune of the pen has now gained over thee, would be too much--No--! by that all-powerful fire which warms the visionary brain, and lights the spirits through unworldly tracts! ere I would force a helpless creature upon this hard service, and make thee pay, poor soul! for fifty pages, which I have no right to sell thee,--naked as I am, I would browse upon the mountains, and smile that the north wind brought me neither my tent or my supper. 

--So put on, my brave boy! and make the best of thy way to Boulogne.
