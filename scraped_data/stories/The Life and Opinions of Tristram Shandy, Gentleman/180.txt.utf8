Chapter 3.LXIII. 

We are now going to enter upon a new scene of events.-- 

--Leave we then the breeches in the taylor's hands, with my father standing over him with his cane, reading him as he sat at work a lecture upon the latus clavus, and pointing to the precise part of the waistband, where he was determined to have it sewed on.-- 

Leave we my mother--(truest of all the Poco-curante's of her sex!)--careless about it, as about every thing else in the world which concerned her;--that is,--indifferent whether it was done this way or that,--provided it was but done at all.-- 

Leave we Slop likewise to the full profits of all my dishonours.-- 

Leave we poor Le Fever to recover, and get home from Marseilles as he can.--And last of all,--because the hardest of all-- 

Let us leave, if possible, myself:--But 'tis impossible,--I must go along with you to the end of the work.
