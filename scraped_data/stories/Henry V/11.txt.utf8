<ACTION>Enter the King of England and all his trainbefore the gates.</ACTION> 

KING HENRY ,  <ACTION>to the men of Harfleur</ACTION> How yet resolves the Governor of the town? This is the latest parle we will admit. Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves Or, like to men proud of destruction, Defy us to our worst. For, as I am a soldier, A name that in my thoughts becomes me best, If I begin the batt’ry once again, I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur Till in her ashes she lie burièd. The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,	 And the fleshed soldier, rough and hard of heart, In liberty of bloody hand, shall range With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass Your fresh fair virgins and your flow’ring infants. What is it then to me if impious war,	 Arrayed in flames like to the prince of fiends, Do with his smirched complexion all fell feats Enlinked to waste and desolation? What is ’t to me, when you yourselves are cause, If your pure maidens fall into the hand	 Of hot and forcing violation? What rein can hold licentious wickedness When down the hill he holds his fierce career? We may as bootless spend our vain command Upon th’ enragèd soldiers in their spoil As send precepts to the Leviathan To come ashore. 

Therefore, you men of Harfleur, Take pity of your town and of your people Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command, Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace	 O’erblows the filthy and contagious clouds Of heady murder, spoil, and villainy.If not, why, in a moment look to see The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand Desire the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters,	 Your fathers taken by the silver beards And their most reverend heads dashed to the walls, Your naked infants spitted upon pikes Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry At Herod’s bloody-hunting slaughtermen. What say you? Will you yield and this avoid Or, guilty in defense, be thus destroyed? 

<ACTION>Enter Governor.</ACTION> 

GOVERNOR Our expectation hath this day an end. The Dauphin, whom of succors we entreated,	 Returns us that his powers are yet not ready To raise so great a siege. Therefore, great king, We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy. Enter our gates, dispose of us and ours, For we no longer are defensible.	 

KING HENRY Open your gates.	Governor exits. Come, uncle Exeter, Go you and enter Harfleur. There remain, And fortify it strongly ’gainst the French. Use mercy to them all for us, dear uncle.	 The winter coming on and sickness growing Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais. Tonight in Harfleur will we be your guest. Tomorrow for the march are we addressed. 

<ACTION>Flourish, and enter the town.</ACTION>
