ORGON, MADAME PERNELLE, ELMIRE, CLEANTE, MARIANE, DAMIS, DORINE 

ORGON Well, mother, am I right or am I not? This writ may help you now to judge the matter. Or don't you see his treason even yet? 

MADAME PERNELLE I'm all amazed, befuddled, and beflustered! 

DORINE (to Orgon) You are quite wrong, you have no right to blame him; This action only proves his good intentions. Love for his neighbour makes his virtue perfect; And knowing money is a root of evil, In Christian charity, he'd take away Whatever things may hinder your salvation. 

ORGON Be still. You always need to have that told you. 

CLEANTE (to Orgon) Come, let us see what course you are to follow. 

ELMIRE Go and expose his bold ingratitude. Such action must invalidate the contract; His perfidy must now appear too black To bring him the success that he expects.
