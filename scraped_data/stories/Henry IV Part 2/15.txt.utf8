<ACTION>Enter Shallow, Falstaff, Page, and Bardolph.</ACTION> 

SHALLOW  By cock and pie, sir, you shall not away tonight.—What, Davy, I say! 

FALSTAFF  You must excuse me, Master Robert Shallow. 

SHALLOW I will not excuse you. You shall not be excused. Excuses shall not be admitted. There is no	 excuse shall serve. You shall not be excused.— 

<ACTION>Enter Davy.</ACTION> 

DAVY  Here, sir. 

SHALLOW  Davy, Davy, Davy, Davy, let me see, Davy, let me see, Davy, let me see. Yea, marry, William cook,	 bid him come hither.—Sir John, you shall not be excused. 

DAVY   Marry, sir, thus: those precepts cannot be served. And again, sir: shall we sow the hade land with wheat?	 

SHALLOW With red wheat, Davy. But for William cook, are there no young pigeons? 

DAVY  Yes, sir. Here is now the smith’s note for shoeing and plow irons.	 <ACTION>He gives Shallow a paper.</ACTION> 

SHALLOW Let it be cast and paid.—Sir John, you shall	 not be excused. 

DAVY Now, sir, a new link to the bucket must needs be had. And, sir, do you mean to stop any of William’s wages about the sack he lost the other day at Hinckley Fair?	 

SHALLOW  He shall answer it. Some pigeons, Davy, a couple of short-legged hens, a joint of mutton, and any pretty little tiny kickshaws, tell William cook. 

<ACTION>Shallow and Davy walk aside.</ACTION> 

DAVY  Doth the man of war stay all night, sir? 

SHALLOW Yea, Davy, I will use him well. A friend i’ th’	 court is better than a penny in purse. Use his men well, Davy, for they are arrant knaves and will backbite. 

DAVY No worse than they are back-bitten, sir, for they have marvelous foul linen. 

SHALLOW   Well-conceited, Davy. About thy business, Davy. 

DAVY I beseech you, sir, to countenance William Visor of Woncot against Clement Perkes o’ th’ hill. 

SHALLOW   There is many complaints, Davy, against that	 Visor. That Visor is an arrant knave, on my knowledge. 

DAVY I grant your Worship that he is a knave, sir, but yet, God forbid, sir, but a knave should have some countenance at his friend’s request. An honest	 man, sir, is able to speak for himself when a knave is not. I have served your Worship truly, sir, this eight years; an I cannot once or twice in a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, I have but a very little credit with your Worship. The knave is	 mine honest friend, sir; therefore I beseech you let him be countenanced. 

SHALLOW  Go to, I say, he shall have no wrong. Look about, Davy.  <ACTION>Davy exits.</ACTION> Where are you, Sir John? Come, come, come, off with your boots.—Give me	 your hand, Master Bardolph. 

BARDOLPH I am glad to see your Worship. 

SHALLOW I thank thee with all my heart, kind Master Bardolph,  <ACTION>(to Page)</ACTION> and welcome, my tall fellow.—Come, Sir John.	 

FALSTAFF I’ll follow you, good Master Robert Shallow. <ACTION>Shallow exits.</ACTION> Bardolph, look to our horses. Bardolph and Page exit. If I were sawed into quantities, I should make four dozen of such bearded hermits’ staves as Master Shallow. It is a wonderful thing to	 see the semblable coherence of his men’s spirits and his. They, by observing of him, do bear themselves like foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is turned into a justice-like servingman. Their spirits are so married in conjunction with the	 participation of society that they flock together in consent like so many wild geese. If I had a suit to Master Shallow, I would humor his men with the imputation of being near their master; if to his men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man	 could better command his servants. It is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught, as men take diseases, one of another. Therefore let men take heed of their company. I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to keep	 Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two actions, and he shall laugh without intervallums. 

O, it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders.O, you shall see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up. 

SHALLOW ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> Sir John. 

FALSTAFF I come, Master Shallow, I come, Master Shallow.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
