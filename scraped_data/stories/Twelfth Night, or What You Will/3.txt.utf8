<ACTION>Enter Valentine, and Viola in man’s attire as Cesario.</ACTION> 

VALENTINE If the Duke continue these favors towards you, Cesario, you are like to be much advanced. He hath known you but three days, and already you are no stranger. 

VIOLA You either fear his humor or my negligence, that	 you call in question the continuance of his love. Is he inconstant, sir, in his favors? 

VALENTINE No, believe me. 

VIOLA  I thank you. 

<ACTION>Enter Orsino, Curio, and Attendants.</ACTION> 

Here comes the Count.	 

ORSINO Who saw Cesario, ho? 

VIOLA  On your attendance, my lord, here. 

ORSINO ,  <ACTION>to Curio and Attendants</ACTION> Stand you awhile aloof.—Cesario, Thou know’st no less but all. I have unclasped To thee the book even of my secret soul.	 Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her. Be not denied access. Stand at her doors And tell them, there thy fixèd foot shall grow Till thou have audience. 

VIOLA Sure, my noble lord,	 If she be so abandoned to her sorrow As it is spoke, she never will admit me. 

ORSINO Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds Rather than make unprofited return. 

VIOLA Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?	 

ORSINO O, then unfold the passion of my love. Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith. It shall become thee well to act my woes. She will attend it better in thy youth Than in a nuncio’s of more grave aspect.	 

VIOLA I think not so, my lord. 

ORSINO Dear lad, believe it; For they shall yet belie thy happy years That say thou art a man. Diana’s lip Is not more smooth and rubious, thy small pipe	 Is as the maiden’s organ, shrill and sound, And all is semblative a womans part. I know thy constellation is right apt For this affair.—Some four or five attend him, All, if you will, for I myself am best	 When least in company.—Prosper well in this And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord, To call his fortunes thine. 

VIOLA I’ll do my best To woo your lady. Aside. Yet a barful strife!	 Whoe’er I woo, myself would be his wife. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
