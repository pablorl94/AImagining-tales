<ACTION>Enter Diomedes and Servingman.</ACTION> 

DIOMEDES Go, go, my servant, take thou Troilus’ horse; Present the fair steed to my Lady Cressid. Fellow, commend my service to her beauty. Tell her I have chastised the amorous Trojan And am her knight by proof.	5 

MAN I go, my lord.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Agamemnon.</ACTION> 

AGAMEMNON Renew, renew! The fierce Polydamas Hath beat down Menon; bastard Margareton Hath Doreus prisoner, And stands colossus-wise, waving his beam	 Upon the pashèd corses of the kings Epistrophus and Cedius. Polyxenes is slain, Amphimachus and Thoas deadly hurt, Patroclus ta’en or slain, and Palamedes Sore hurt and bruised. The dreadful Sagittary	 Appals our numbers. Haste we, Diomed, To reinforcement, or we perish all. 

<ACTION>Enter Nestor, with Soldiers bearing the body ofPatroclus.</ACTION> 

NESTOR Go, bear Patroclus’ body to Achilles, And bid the snail-paced Ajax arm for shame. Soldiers exit with Patroclus’s body. There is a thousand Hectors in the field.	 Now here he fights on Galathe his horse, And here lacks work; anon he’s there afoot And there they fly or die, like scalèd schools Before the belching whale; then is he yonder, And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,	 Fall down before him like a mower’s swath. Here, there, and everywhere he leaves and takes, Dexterity so obeying appetite That what he will he does, and does so much That proof is called impossibility.	 

<ACTION>Enter Ulysses.</ACTION> 

ULYSSES O, courage, courage, princes! Great Achilles Is arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance. Patroclus’ wounds have roused his drowsy blood, Together with his mangled Myrmidons, That noseless, handless, hacked and chipped, come	 to him, Crying on Hector. Ajax hath lost a friend And foams at mouth, and he is armed and at it, Roaring for Troilus, who hath done today Mad and fantastic execution,	40 Engaging and redeeming of himself With such a careless force and forceless care As if that luck, in very spite of cunning, Bade him win all. 

<ACTION>Enter Ajax.</ACTION> 

AJAX Troilus, thou coward Troilus!  

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

DIOMEDES Ay, there, there!	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

NESTOR  So, so, we draw together. 

<ACTION>Enter Achilles.</ACTION> 

ACHILLES Where is this Hector?— Come, come, thou boy-queller, show thy face! Know what it is to meet Achilles angry.	 Hector! Where’s Hector? I will none but Hector. 

<ACTION>He exits, with the others.</ACTION>
