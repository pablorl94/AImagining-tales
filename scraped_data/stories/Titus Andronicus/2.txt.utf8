<ACTION>Enter Titus Andronicus and his three sons, andMarcus, making a noise with hounds and horns.</ACTION> 

TITUS The hunt is up, the moon is bright and gray, The fields are fragrant, and the woods are green. Uncouple here, and let us make a bay And wake the Emperor and his lovely bride, And rouse the Prince, and ring a hunter’s peal,	 That all the court may echo with the noise. Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours, To attend the Emperor’s person carefully. I have been troubled in my sleep this night, But dawning day new comfort hath inspired.	 

<ACTION>Here a cry of hounds, and wind horns in a peal. Thenenter Saturninus, Tamora, Bassianus, Lavinia, Chiron,Demetrius, and their Attendants.</ACTION> 

TITUS Many good morrows to your Majesty;— Madam, to you as many, and as good.— I promisèd your Grace a hunter’s peal. 

SATURNINUS And you have rung it lustily, my lords— Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.	 

BASSIANUS Lavinia, how say you? 

LAVINIA I say no. I have been broad awake two hours and more. 

SATURNINUS Come on, then. Horse and chariots let us have, And to our sport. (To Tamora) Madam, now shall	 you see Our Roman hunting. 

MARCUS I have dogs, my lord, Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase And climb the highest promontory top.	 

TITUS And I have horse will follow where the game Makes way and runs like swallows o’er the plain. 

DEMETRIUS ,  <ACTION>aside to Chiron</ACTION> Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound, But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
