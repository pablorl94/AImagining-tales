SCENE VI.--HARPAGON, ÉLISE. 

HAR. There goes one of your effeminate fops, with no more stamina than a chicken. That is what I have resolved for myself, my daughter. As to your brother, I have thought for him of a certain widow, of whom I heard this morning; and you I shall give to Mr. Anselme. 

ELI. To Mr. Anselme? 

HAR. Yes, a staid and prudent man, who is not above fifty, and of whose riches everybody speaks. 

ELI. (_curtseying_). I have no wish to marry, father, if you please. 

HAR. (_imitating_ ÉLISE). And I, my little girl, my darling, I wish you to marry, if you please. 

ELI. (_curtseying again_). I beg your pardon, my father. 

HAR. (_again imitating_ ÉLISE). I beg your pardon, my daughter. 

ELI. I am the very humble servant of Mr. Anselme, but (_curtseying again_), with your leave, I shall not marry him. 

HAR. I am your very humble servant, but (_again imitating_ ÉLISE) you will marry him this very evening. 

ELI. This evening? 

HAR. This evening. 

ELI. (_curtseying again_). It cannot be done, father. 

HAR. (_imitating_ ÉLISE). It will be done, daughter. 

ELI. No. 

HAR. Yes. 

ELI. No, I tell you. 

HAR. Yes, I tell you. 

ELI. You will never force me to do such a thing 

HAR. I will force you to it. 

ELI. I had rather kill myself than marry such a man. 

HAR. You will not kill yourself, and you will marry him. But did you ever see such impudence? Did ever any one hear a daughter speak in such a fashion to her father? 

ELI. But did ever anyone see a father marry his daughter after such a fashion? 

HAR. It is a match against which nothing can be said, and I am perfectly sure that everybody will approve of my choice. 

ELI. And I know that it will be approved of by no reasonable person. 

HAR. (_seeing_ VALÈRE). There is Valère coming. Shall we make him judge in this affair? 

ELI. Willingly. 

HAR. You will abide by what he says? 

ELI. Yes, whatever he thinks right, I will do. 

HAR. Agreed.
