<ACTION>Enter Sir Hugh Evans and Simple.</ACTION> 

SIR HUGH Go your ways, and ask of Doctor Caius’ house which is the way. And there dwells one Mistress Quickly, which is in the manner of his nurse, or his dry nurse, or his cook, or his laundry—his washer and his wringer.	 

SIMPLE Well, sir. 

SIR HUGH Nay, it is petter yet. Give her this letter <ACTION>(handing him a paper)</ACTION> , for it is a ’oman that altogether’s acquaintance with Mistress Anne Page; and the letter is to desire and require her to solicit	 your master’s desires to Mistress Anne Page. I pray you, be gone. I will make an end of my dinner; there’s pippins and cheese to come. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
