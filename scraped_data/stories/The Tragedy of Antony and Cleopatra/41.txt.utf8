<ACTION>Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, and Iras.</ACTION> 

CLEOPATRA My desolation does begin to make A better life. ’Tis paltry to be Caesar; Not being Fortune, he’s but Fortune’s knave, A minister of her will. And it is great To do that thing that ends all other deeds,	 Which shackles accidents and bolts up change, Which sleeps and never palates more the dung, The beggar’s nurse, and Caesar’s. 

<ACTION>Enter Proculeius.</ACTION> 

PROCULEIUS Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt, And bids thee study on what fair demands	 Thou mean’st to have him grant thee. 

CLEOPATRA What’s thy name? 

PROCULEIUS My name is Proculeius. 

CLEOPATRA Antony Did tell me of you, bade me trust you, but	 I do not greatly care to be deceived That have no use for trusting. If your master Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him That majesty, to keep decorum, must No less beg than a kingdom. If he please	 To give me conquered Egypt for my son, He gives me so much of mine own as I Will kneel to him with thanks. 

PROCULEIUS Be of good cheer. You’re fall’n into a princely hand; fear nothing.	 Make your full reference freely to my lord, Who is so full of grace that it flows over On all that need. Let me report to him Your sweet dependency, and you shall find A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness	 Where he for grace is kneeled to. 

CLEOPATRA Pray you tell him I am his fortune’s vassal and I send him The greatness he has got. I hourly learn A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly	 Look him i’ th’ face. 

PROCULEIUS This I’ll report, dear lady. Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied Of him that caused it. 

<ACTION>Gallus and Soldiers enter and seize Cleopatra.</ACTION> 

GALLUS You see how easily she may be surprised.	 Guard her till Caesar come. 

IRAS Royal queen! 

CHARMIAN O, Cleopatra, thou art taken, queen! 

CLEOPATRA ,  <ACTION>drawing a dagger</ACTION> Quick, quick, good hands! 

PROCULEIUS ,  <ACTION>seizing the dagger</ACTION> Hold, worthy lady, hold! 	  Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this Relieved, but not betrayed. 

CLEOPATRA What, of death, too, That rids our dogs of languish? 

PROCULEIUS Cleopatra,	 Do not abuse my master’s bounty by Th’ undoing of yourself. Let the world see His nobleness well acted, which your death Will never let come forth. 

CLEOPATRA Where art thou, Death?	 Come hither, come! Come, come, and take a queen Worth many babes and beggars. 

PROCULEIUS O, temperance, lady! 

CLEOPATRA Sir, I will eat no meat; I’ll not drink, sir. If idle talk will once be necessary—	 I’ll not sleep neither. This mortal house I’ll ruin, Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I Will not wait pinioned at your master’s court, Nor once be chastised with the sober eye Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up	 And show me to the shouting varletry Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt Be gentle grave unto me; rather on Nilus’ mud Lay me stark naked, and let the waterflies Blow me into abhorring; rather make	 My country’s high pyramides my gibbet And hang me up in chains! 

PROCULEIUS  You do extend These thoughts of horror further than you shall Find cause in Caesar.	 

<ACTION>Enter Dolabella.</ACTION> 

DOLABELLA Proculeius, What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows, And he hath sent for thee. For the Queen, I’ll take her to my guard. 

PROCULEIUS So, Dolabella,	 It shall content me best. Be gentle to her. <ACTION>To Cleopatra.</ACTION> To Caesar I will speak what you shall please, If you’ll employ me to him. 

CLEOPATRA Say I would die.	 

<ACTION>Proculeius, Gallus, and Soldiers exit.</ACTION> 

DOLABELLA Most noble empress, you have heard of me. 

CLEOPATRA I cannot tell. 

DOLABELLA  Assuredly you know me. 

CLEOPATRA No matter, sir, what I have heard or known. You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;	 Is ’t not your trick? 

DOLABELLA I understand not, madam. 

CLEOPATRA I dreamt there was an emperor Antony. O, such another sleep, that I might see But such another man.	 

DOLABELLA If it might please you— 

CLEOPATRA His face was as the heavens, and therein stuck A sun and moon, which kept their course and lighted The little O, the Earth.	 

DOLABELLA Most sovereign creature— 

CLEOPATRA His legs bestrid the ocean, his reared arm Crested the world. His voice was propertied As all the tunèd spheres, and that to friends; But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,	 He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty, There was no winter in ’t; an autumn ’twas That grew the more by reaping. His delights Were dolphin-like; they showed his back above The element they lived in. In his livery	 Walked crowns and crownets; realms and islands were As plates dropped from his pocket. 

DOLABELLA  Cleopatra— 

CLEOPATRA Think you there was, or might be, such a man	 As this I dreamt of? 

DOLABELLA Gentle madam, no. 

CLEOPATRA You lie up to the hearing of the gods! But if there be nor ever were one such, It’s past the size of dreaming. Nature wants stuff	 To vie strange forms with fancy, yet t’ imagine An Antony were nature’s piece ’gainst fancy, Condemning shadows quite. 

DOLABELLA Hear me, good madam. Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it	 As answering to the weight. Would I might never O’ertake pursued success but I do feel, By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites My very heart at root. 

CLEOPATRA I thank you, sir.	 Know you what Caesar means to do with me? 

DOLABELLA I am loath to tell you what I would you knew. 

CLEOPATRA Nay, pray you, sir. 

DOLABELLA  Though he be honorable— 

CLEOPATRA He’ll lead me, then, in triumph.	 

DOLABELLA Madam, he will. I know ’t. 

<ACTION>Flourish. Enter Caesar, Proculeius, Gallus, Maecenas,and others of his train.</ACTION> 

ALL Make way there! Caesar! 

CAESAR  Which is the Queen of Egypt? 

DOLABELLA It is the Emperor, madam. 

<ACTION>Cleopatra kneels.</ACTION> 

CAESAR Arise. You shall not kneel.	 I pray you, rise. Rise, Egypt. 

CLEOPATRA Sir, the gods Will have it thus. My master and my lord I must obey.	 <ACTION>She stands.</ACTION> 

CAESAR Take to you no hard thoughts.	 The record of what injuries you did us, Though written in our flesh, we shall remember As things but done by chance. 

CLEOPATRA  Sole sir o’ th’ world, I cannot project mine own cause so well	 To make it clear, but do confess I have Been laden with like frailties which before Have often shamed our sex. 

CAESAR Cleopatra, know We will extenuate rather than enforce.	 If you apply yourself to our intents, Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find A benefit in this change; but if you seek To lay on me a cruelty by taking Antony’s course, you shall bereave yourself	 Of my good purposes, and put your children To that destruction which I’ll guard them from If thereon you rely. I’ll take my leave. 

CLEOPATRA And may through all the world. ’Tis yours, and we, Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall	 Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord. 

<ACTION>She holds out a paper.</ACTION> 

CAESAR You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra. 

CLEOPATRA This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels I am possessed of. ’Tis exactly valued, Not petty things admitted.—Where’s Seleucus?	 

<ACTION>Enter Seleucus.</ACTION> 

SELEUCUS Here, madam. 

CLEOPATRA This is my treasurer. Let him speak, my lord, Upon his peril, that I have reserved To myself nothing.—Speak the truth, Seleucus. 

SELEUCUS Madam, I had rather seel my lips	 Than to my peril speak that which is not. 

CLEOPATRA  What have I kept back? 

SELEUCUS Enough to purchase what you have made known. 

CAESAR Nay, blush not, Cleopatra. I approve Your wisdom in the deed.	 

CLEOPATRA See, Caesar, O, behold How pomp is followed! Mine will now be yours, And should we shift estates, yours would be mine. The ingratitude of this Seleucus does Even make me wild.—O slave, of no more trust	 Than love that’s hired! What, goest thou back? Thou shalt Go back, I warrant thee! But I’ll catch thine eyes Though they had wings. Slave, soulless villain, dog! O rarely base!	 

CAESAR Good queen, let us entreat you— 

CLEOPATRA O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this, That thou vouchsafing here to visit me, Doing the honor of thy lordliness To one so meek, that mine own servant should	 Parcel the sum of my disgraces by Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar, That I some lady trifles have reserved, Immoment toys, things of such dignity As we greet modern friends withal, and say	 Some nobler token I have kept apart For Livia and Octavia, to induce Their mediation, must I be unfolded With one that I have bred? The gods! It smites me Beneath the fall I have.  <ACTION>To Seleucus. </ACTION> Prithee, go	 hence, Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits Through th’ ashes of my chance. Wert thou a man, Thou wouldst have mercy on me. 

CAESAR  Forbear, Seleucus.	 

<ACTION>Seleucus exits.</ACTION> 

CLEOPATRA Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought For things that others do; and when we fall, We answer others’ merits in our name— Are therefore to be pitied. 

CAESAR Cleopatra,	 Not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged Put we i’ th’ roll of conquest. Still be ’t yours! Bestow it at your pleasure, and believe Caesar’s no merchant to make prize with you Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be	 cheered. Make not your thoughts your prisons. No, dear queen, For we intend so to dispose you as Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed and sleep.	 Our care and pity is so much upon you That we remain your friend. And so adieu. 

CLEOPATRA My master and my lord! 

CAESAR Not so. Adieu. 

<ACTION>Flourish. Caesar and his train exit.</ACTION> 

CLEOPATRA He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not	 Be noble to myself. But hark thee, Charmian. <ACTION>She whispers to Charmian.</ACTION> 

IRAS Finish, good lady. The bright day is done, And we are for the dark. 

CLEOPATRA ,  <ACTION>to Charmian</ACTION> Hie thee again. I have spoke already, and it is provided.	 Go put it to the haste. 

CHARMIAN Madam, I will. 

<ACTION>Enter Dolabella.</ACTION> 

DOLABELLA Where’s the Queen? 

CHARMIAN  Behold, sir.	 <ACTION>She exits.</ACTION> 

CLEOPATRA Dolabella.	 

DOLABELLA Madam, as thereto sworn by your command, Which my love makes religion to obey, I tell you this: Caesar through Syria Intends his journey, and within three days You with your children will he send before.	 Make your best use of this. I have performed Your pleasure and my promise. 

CLEOPATRA Dolabella, I shall remain your debtor. 

DOLABELLA I your servant.	 Adieu, good queen. I must attend on Caesar. 

CLEOPATRA Farewell, and thanks.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

Now, Iras, what think’st thou? Thou an Egyptian puppet shall be shown In Rome as well as I. Mechanic slaves	 With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers shall Uplift us to the view. In their thick breaths, Rank of gross diet, shall we be enclouded And forced to drink their vapor. 

IRAS  The gods forbid!	 

CLEOPATRA Nay, ’tis most certain, Iras. Saucy lictors Will catch at us like strumpets, and scald rhymers Ballad us out o’ tune. The quick comedians Extemporally will stage us and present Our Alexandrian revels. Antony	 Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness I’ th’ posture of a whore. 

IRAS O the good gods! 

CLEOPATRA Nay, that’s certain.	 

IRAS I’ll never see ’t! For I am sure mine nails Are stronger than mine eyes. 

CLEOPATRA  Why, that’s the way To fool their preparation and to conquer Their most absurd intents.	 

<ACTION>Enter Charmian.</ACTION> 

Now, Charmian! Show me, my women, like a queen. Go fetch My best attires. I am again for Cydnus To meet Mark Antony. Sirrah Iras, go.— Now, noble Charmian, we’ll dispatch indeed,	 And when thou hast done this chare, I’ll give thee leave To play till Doomsday.—Bring our crown and all. Iras exits.  <ACTION>A noise within.</ACTION> Wherefore’s this noise? 

<ACTION>Enter a Guardsman.</ACTION> 

GUARDSMAN Here is a rural fellow	 That will not be denied your Highness’ presence. He brings you figs. 

CLEOPATRA Let him come in.	 <ACTION>Guardsman exits.</ACTION> What poor an instrument May do a noble deed! He brings me liberty.	 My resolution’s placed, and I have nothing Of woman in me. Now from head to foot I am marble-constant. Now the fleeting moon No planet is of mine. 

<ACTION>Enter Guardsman and Countryman, with a basket.</ACTION> 

GUARDSMAN This is the man.	 

CLEOPATRA Avoid, and leave him.	 <ACTION>Guardsman exits.</ACTION> Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there That kills and pains not? 

COUNTRYMAN Truly I have him, but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him, for	 his biting is immortal. Those that do die of it do seldom or never recover. 

CLEOPATRA Remember’st thou any that have died on ’t? 

COUNTRYMAN  Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of them no longer than yesterday—a	 very honest woman, but something given to lie, as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty— how she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt. Truly, she makes a very good report o’ th’ worm. But he that will believe all that they say shall never	 be saved by half that they do. But this is most falliable, the worm’s an odd worm. 

CLEOPATRA Get thee hence. Farewell. 

COUNTRYMAN I wish you all joy of the worm. He sets down the basket. 

CLEOPATRA Farewell.	 

COUNTRYMAN You must think this, look you, that the worm will do his kind. 

CLEOPATRA Ay, ay, farewell. 

COUNTRYMAN Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people, for indeed there	 is no goodness in the worm. 

CLEOPATRA Take thou no care; it shall be heeded. 

COUNTRYMAN Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is not worth the feeding. 

CLEOPATRA  Will it eat me?	 COUNTRYMAN  You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman. I know that a woman is a dish for the gods if the devil dress her not. But truly these same whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women, for in every	 ten that they make, the devils mar five. 

CLEOPATRA  Well, get thee gone. Farewell. 

COUNTRYMAN Yes, forsooth. I wish you joy o’ th’ worm.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Iras bearing Cleopatra’s royal regalia.</ACTION> 

CLEOPATRA Give me my robe. Put on my crown. I have	 Immortal longings in me. Now no more The juice of Egypt’s grape shall moist this lip. Charmian and Iras begin to dress her. Yare, yare, good Iras, quick. Methinks I hear Antony call. I see him rouse himself To praise my noble act. I hear him mock	 The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men To excuse their after wrath.—Husband, I come! Now to that name my courage prove my title. I am fire and air; my other elements I give to baser life.—So, have you done?	 Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips. Farewell, kind Charmian.—Iras, long farewell. She kisses them. <ACTION> Iras falls and dies.</ACTION> Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall? If thou and nature can so gently part, The stroke of death is as a lover’s pinch,	 Which hurts and is desired. Dost thou lie still? If thus thou vanishest, thou tell’st the world It is not worth leave-taking. 

CHARMIAN Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say The gods themselves do weep!	 

CLEOPATRA This proves me base. If she first meet the curlèd Antony, He’ll make demand of her, and spend that kiss Which is my heaven to have.—Come, thou mortal wretch,	 <ACTION>She places an asp on her breast.  </ACTION> With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate Of life at once untie. Poor venomous fool, Be angry and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak, That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass Unpolicied!	 

CHARMIAN O eastern star! 

CLEOPATRA Peace, peace! Dost thou not see my baby at my breast, That sucks the nurse asleep? 

CHARMIAN O, break! O, break!	 

CLEOPATRA As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle— O Antony!—Nay, I will take thee too. <ACTION>She places an asp on her arm.</ACTION> What should I stay—	 <ACTION>Dies.</ACTION> 

CHARMIAN In this wild world? So, fare thee well. Now boast thee, Death, in thy possession lies	 A lass unparalleled. Downy windows, close, She closes Cleopatra’s eyes. And golden Phoebus, never be beheld Of eyes again so royal. Your crown’s awry. I’ll mend it, and then play— 

<ACTION>Enter the Guard rustling in.</ACTION> 

FIRST GUARD Where’s the Queen?	 

CHARMIAN  Speak softly. Wake her not. 

FIRST GUARD Caesar hath sent— 

CHARMIAN Too slow a messenger. <ACTION>She takes out an asp.</ACTION> O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee. 

FIRST GUARD Approach, ho! All’s not well. Caesar’s beguiled.	 

SECOND GUARD There’s Dolabella sent from Caesar. Call him. 

<ACTION>A Guardsman exits.</ACTION> 

FIRST GUARD What work is here, Charmian? Is this well done? 

CHARMIAN It is well done, and fitting for a princess Descended of so many royal kings. Ah, soldier!	 <ACTION>Charmian dies.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Dolabella.</ACTION> 

DOLABELLA How goes it here? 

SECOND GUARD All dead. 

DOLABELLA  Caesar, thy thoughts Touch their effects in this. Thyself art coming To see performed the dreaded act which thou	 So sought’st to hinder. 

<ACTION>Enter Caesar and all his train, marching.</ACTION> 

ALL A way there, a way for Caesar! 

DOLABELLA O sir, you are too sure an augurer: That you did fear is done. 

CAESAR Bravest at the last,	 She leveled at our purposes and, being royal, Took her own way. The manner of their deaths? I do not see them bleed. 

DOLABELLA Who was last with them? 

FIRST GUARD A simple countryman that brought her figs.	 This was his basket. 

CAESAR Poisoned, then. 

FIRST GUARD O Caesar, This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake. I found her trimming up the diadem	 On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood, And on the sudden dropped. 

CAESAR O, noble weakness! If they had swallowed poison, ’twould appear By external swelling; but she looks like sleep,	 As she would catch another Antony In her strong toil of grace. 

DOLABELLA Here on her breast There is a vent of blood, and something blown. The like is on her arm.	 

FIRST GUARD This is an aspic’s trail, and these fig leaves Have slime upon them, such as th’ aspic leaves Upon the caves of Nile. 

CAESAR Most probable That so she died, for her physician tells me	 She hath pursued conclusions infinite Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed, And bear her women from the monument. She shall be buried by her Antony. No grave upon the earth shall clip in it	 A pair so famous. High events as these Strike those that make them; and their story is No less in pity than his glory which Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall In solemn show attend this funeral,	 And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see High order in this great solemnity. 

<ACTION>They all exit, the Guardsbearing the dead bodies.</ACTION>
