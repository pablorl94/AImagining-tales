<ACTION>Enter Duke Humphrey of Gloucester and his wifethe Duchess Eleanor.</ACTION> 

DUCHESS Why droops my lord like over-ripened corn Hanging the head at Ceres’ plenteous load? Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows, As frowning at the favors of the world? Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth, Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight? What seest thou there? King Henry’s diadem, Enchased with all the honors of the world? If so, gaze on and grovel on thy face Until thy head be circled with the same.	 Put forth thy hand; reach at the glorious gold. What, is ’t too short? I’ll lengthen it with mine; And, having both together heaved it up, We’ll both together lift our heads to heaven And never more abase our sight so low	 As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground. 

GLOUCESTER O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord, Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts! And may that hour when I imagine ill Against my king and nephew, virtuous Henry,	 Be my last breathing in this mortal world! My troublous dreams this night doth make me sad. 

DUCHESS What dreamed my lord? Tell me, and I’ll requite it With sweet rehearsal of my morning’s dream. 

GLOUCESTER Methought this staff, mine office badge in court, Was broke in twain—by whom I have forgot, But, as I think, it was by th’ Cardinal— And on the pieces of the broken wand Were placed the heads of Edmund, Duke of Somerset,	 And William de la Pole, first Duke of Suffolk. This was my dream. What it doth bode God knows. 

DUCHESS Tut, this was nothing but an argument That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester’s grove Shall lose his head for his presumption.	 But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke: Methought I sat in seat of majesty, In the cathedral church of Westminster And in that chair where kings and queens were crowned,	 Where Henry and Dame Margaret kneeled to me And on my head did set the diadem. 

GLOUCESTER Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright. Presumptuous dame, ill-nurtured Eleanor, Art thou not second woman in the realm	 And the Protector’s wife, beloved of him? Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command, Above the reach or compass of thy thought? And wilt thou still be hammering treachery To tumble down thy husband and thyself	 From top of honor to disgrace’s feet? Away from me, and let me hear no more! 

DUCHESS What, what, my lord? Are you so choleric With Eleanor for telling but her dream? Next time I’ll keep my dreams unto myself	 And not be checked. 

GLOUCESTER Nay, be not angry. I am pleased again. 

<ACTION>Enter Messenger.</ACTION> 

MESSENGER My Lord Protector, ’tis his Highness’ pleasure You do prepare to ride unto Saint Albans, Whereas the King and Queen do mean to hawk.	 

GLOUCESTER I go.—Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us? 

DUCHESS Yes, my good lord. I’ll follow presently. Gloucester exits, with Messenger. Follow I must; I cannot go before While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind. Were I a man, a duke, and next of blood, I would remove these tedious stumbling blocks And smooth my way upon their headless necks; And, being a woman, I will not be slack To play my part in Fortune’s pageant.— Where are you there? Sir John! Nay, fear not, man. We are alone; here’s none but thee and I. 

<ACTION>Enter Sir John Hume.</ACTION> 

HUME Jesus preserve your royal Majesty! 

DUCHESS What sayst thou? “Majesty”? I am but “Grace.” 

HUME But by the grace of God and Hume’s advice, Your Grace’s title shall be multiplied.	 

DUCHESS What sayst thou, man? Hast thou as yet conferred With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch, With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjurer? And will they undertake to do me good? 

HUME This they have promisèd: to show your Highness	 A spirit raised from depth of underground That shall make answer to such questions As by your Grace shall be propounded him. 

DUCHESS It is enough. I’ll think upon the questions. When from Saint Albans we do make return,	 We’ll see these things effected to the full. Here, Hume, take this reward. <ACTION>She gives him money.</ACTION> Make merry, man, With thy confederates in this weighty cause. <ACTION>Duchess exits.</ACTION> 

HUME Hume must make merry with the Duchess’ gold.	 Marry, and shall! But, how now, Sir John Hume? Seal up your lips, and give no words but “mum”; The business asketh silent secrecy. Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch; Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil.	 Yet have I gold flies from another coast— I dare not say, from the rich cardinal And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk, Yet I do find it so. For, to be plain, They, knowing Dame Eleanor’s aspiring humor,	 Have hirèd me to undermine the Duchess And buzz these conjurations in her brain. They say a crafty knave does need no broker, Yet am I Suffolk and the Cardinal’s broker. Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near	 To call them both a pair of crafty knaves. Well, so it stands; and thus I fear at last Hume’s knavery will be the Duchess’ wrack, And her attainture will be Humphrey’s fall. Sort how it will, I shall have gold for all.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
