<ACTION>Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, and Philostrate, Lords, andAttendants.</ACTION> 

HIPPOLYTA ’Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of. 

THESEUS More strange than true. I never may believe These antique fables nor these fairy toys. Lovers and madmen have such seething brains, Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend	 More than cool reason ever comprehends. The lunatic, the lover, and the poet Are of imagination all compact. One sees more devils than vast hell can hold: That is the madman. The lover, all as frantic,	 Sees Helen’s beauty in a brow of Egypt. The poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling, Doth glance from heaven to Earth, from Earth to heaven, And as imagination bodies forth	 The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name. Such tricks hath strong imagination That, if it would but apprehend some joy, It comprehends some bringer of that joy. Or in the night, imagining some fear, How easy is a bush supposed a bear! 

HIPPOLYTA But all the story of the night told over, And all their minds transfigured so together,	 More witnesseth than fancy’s images And grows to something of great constancy, But, howsoever, strange and admirable. 

<ACTION>Enter Lovers: Lysander, Demetrius, Hermia, and Helena.</ACTION> 

THESEUS Here come the lovers full of joy and mirth.— Joy, gentle friends! Joy and fresh days of love	 Accompany your hearts! 

LYSANDER More than to us Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed! 

THESEUS Come now, what masques, what dances shall we have		 To wear away this long age of three hours Between our after-supper and bedtime? Where is our usual manager of mirth? What revels are in hand? Is there no play To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?	 Call Philostrate. 

PHILOSTRATE ,  <ACTION>coming forward </ACTION> Here, mighty Theseus. 

THESEUS Say what abridgment have you for this evening, What masque, what music? How shall we beguile The lazy time if not with some delight?	 

PHILOSTRATE ,  <ACTION>giving Theseus a paper</ACTION> There is a brief how many sports are ripe. Make choice of which your Highness will see first. 

THESEUS “The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.” We’ll none of that. That have I told my love	 In glory of my kinsman Hercules. “The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals, Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.” That is an old device, and it was played When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.	 “The thrice-three Muses mourning for the death Of learning, late deceased in beggary.” That is some satire, keen and critical, Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony. “A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus	 And his love Thisbe, very tragical mirth.” “Merry” and “tragical”? “Tedious” and “brief”? That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow! How shall we find the concord of this discord? 

PHILOSTRATE A play there is, my lord, some ten words long	 (Which is as brief as I have known a play), But by ten words, my lord, it is too long, Which makes it tedious; for in all the play, There is not one word apt, one player fitted. And tragical, my noble lord, it is.	 For Pyramus therein doth kill himself, Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess, Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears The passion of loud laughter never shed. 

THESEUS What are they that do play it?	 

PHILOSTRATE Hard-handed men that work in Athens here, Which never labored in their minds till now, And now have toiled their unbreathed memories With this same play, against your nuptial. 

THESEUS And we will hear it.	 

PHILOSTRATE  No, my noble lord, It is not for you. I have heard it over, And it is nothing, nothing in the world, Unless you can find sport in their intents, Extremely stretched and conned with cruel pain	 To do you service. 

THESEUS I will hear that play, For never anything can be amiss When simpleness and duty tender it. Go, bring them in—and take your places, ladies.	 

<ACTION>Philostrate exits.</ACTION> 

HIPPOLYTA I love not to see wretchedness o’ercharged, And duty in his service perishing. 

THESEUS Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing. 

HIPPOLYTA He says they can do nothing in this kind. 

THESEUS The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.	 Our sport shall be to take what they mistake; And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect Takes it in might, not merit. Where I have come, great clerks have purposèd To greet me with premeditated welcomes,	 Where I have seen them shiver and look pale, Make periods in the midst of sentences, Throttle their practiced accent in their fears, And in conclusion dumbly have broke off, Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,	 Out of this silence yet I picked a welcome, And in the modesty of fearful duty, I read as much as from the rattling tongue Of saucy and audacious eloquence. Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity	 In least speak most, to my capacity. 

<ACTION>Enter Philostrate.</ACTION> 

PHILOSTRATE So please your Grace, the Prologue is addressed. 

THESEUS Let him approach. 

<ACTION>Enter the Prologue.</ACTION> 

PROLOGUE If we offend, it is with our goodwill. That you should think we come not to offend,	 But with goodwill. To show our simple skill, That is the true beginning of our end. Consider, then, we come but in despite. We do not come, as minding to content you, Our true intent is. All for your delight	 We are not here. That you should here repent you, The actors are at hand, and, by their show, You shall know all that you are like to know. <ACTION>Prologue exits.</ACTION> 

THESEUS This fellow doth not stand upon points.	 

LYSANDER He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak, but to speak true. 

HIPPOLYTA Indeed he hath played on this prologue like a child on a recorder—a sound, but not in	 government. 

THESEUS His speech was like a tangled chain—nothing impaired, but all disordered. Who is next? 

<ACTION>Enter Pyramus (Bottom), and Thisbe (Flute), andWall (Snout), and Moonshine (Starveling), and Lion(Snug), and Prologue (Quince).</ACTION> 

QUINCE ,  <ACTION>as Prologue</ACTION> Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show. But wonder on, till truth make all things plain. This man is Pyramus, if you would know. This beauteous lady Thisbe is certain. This man with lime and roughcast doth present “Wall,” that vile wall which did these lovers sunder;	 And through Wall’s chink, poor souls, they are content To whisper, at the which let no man wonder. This man, with lantern, dog, and bush of thorn, Presenteth “Moonshine,” for, if you will know,	 By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn To meet at Ninus’ tomb, there, there to woo. This grisly beast (which “Lion” hight by name) The trusty Thisbe coming first by night Did scare away or rather did affright;	 And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall, Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain. Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall, And finds his trusty Thisbe’s mantle slain. Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,	 He bravely broached his boiling bloody breast. And Thisbe, tarrying in mulberry shade, His dagger drew, and died. 

For all the rest, Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain At large discourse, while here they do remain.

THESEUS I wonder if the lion be to speak. 

DEMETRIUS No wonder, my lord. One lion may when many asses do. 

<ACTION>Lion, Thisbe, Moonshine, and Prologue exit.</ACTION> 

SNOUT , <ACTION> as Wall</ACTION> In this same interlude it doth befall That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;	 And such a wall as I would have you think That had in it a crannied hole or chink, Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe, Did whisper often, very secretly. This loam, this roughcast, and this stone doth show	 That I am that same wall. The truth is so. And this the cranny is, right and sinister, Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper. 

THESEUS Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?	 

DEMETRIUS It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse, my lord. 

THESEUS Pyramus draws near the wall. Silence. 

BOTTOM ,  <ACTION>as Pyramus</ACTION> O grim-looked night! O night with hue so black! O night, which ever art when day is not!	 O night! O night! Alack, alack, alack! I fear my Thisbe’s promise is forgot. And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall, That stand’st between her father’s ground and mine,	 Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall, Show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne. Thanks, courteous wall. Jove shield thee well for this.		 But what see I? No Thisbe do I see. O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss, Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me! 

THESEUS The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.	 

BOTTOM  No, in truth, sir, he should not. “Deceiving me” is Thisbe’s cue. She is to enter now, and I am to spy her through the wall. You shall see it will fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes. 

<ACTION>Enter Thisbe (Flute).</ACTION> 

FLUTE ,  <ACTION>as Thisbe</ACTION> O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans	 For parting my fair Pyramus and me. My cherry lips have often kissed thy stones, Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee. 

BOTTOM ,  <ACTION>as Pyramus</ACTION> I see a voice! Now will I to the chink To spy an I can hear my Thisbe’s face.	 Thisbe? 

FLUTE ,  <ACTION>as Thisbe</ACTION> My love! Thou art my love, I think. 

BOTTOM ,  <ACTION>as Pyramus</ACTION> Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover’s grace, And, like Limander, am I trusty still. 

FLUTE ,  <ACTION>as Thisbe</ACTION> And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.	 

BOTTOM ,  <ACTION>as Pyramus</ACTION> Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true. 

FLUTE , <ACTION> as Thisbe</ACTION> As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you. 

BOTTOM ,  <ACTION>as Pyramus</ACTION> O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall. 

FLUTE ,  <ACTION>as Thisbe</ACTION> I kiss the wall’s hole, not your lips at all. 

BOTTOM ,  <ACTION>as Pyramus</ACTION> Wilt thou at Ninny’s tomb meet me straightway?	 

FLUTE ,  <ACTION>as Thisbe</ACTION> ’Tide life, ’tide death, I come without delay. <ACTION>Bottom and Flute exit.</ACTION> 

SNOUT ,  <ACTION>as Wall  </ACTION> Thus have I, Wall, my part dischargèd so, And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

THESEUS Now is the wall down between the two neighbors.	 

DEMETRIUS No remedy, my lord, when walls are so willful to hear without warning. 

HIPPOLYTA This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard. 

THESEUS The best in this kind are but shadows, and the worst are no worse, if imagination amend	 them. 

HIPPOLYTA It must be your imagination, then, and not theirs. 

THESEUS If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here	 come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion. 

<ACTION>Enter Lion (Snug) and Moonshine (Starveling).</ACTION> 

SNUG ,  <ACTION>as Lion</ACTION> You ladies, you whose gentle hearts do fear The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor, May now perchance both quake and tremble here,	 When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar. Then know that I, as Snug the joiner, am A lion fell, nor else no lion’s dam; For if I should as lion come in strife Into this place, ’twere pity on my life.	 

THESEUS A very gentle beast, and of a good conscience. 

DEMETRIUS The very best at a beast, my lord, that e’er I saw. 

LYSANDER This lion is a very fox for his valor.	 

THESEUS True, and a goose for his discretion. 

DEMETRIUS Not so, my lord, for his valor cannot carry his discretion, and the fox carries the goose. 

THESEUS  His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valor, for the goose carries not the fox. It is well.	 Leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the Moon. 

STARVELING ,  <ACTION>as Moonshine</ACTION> This lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present. 

DEMETRIUS He should have worn the horns on his head.	 

THESEUS He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the circumference. 

STARVELING ,  <ACTION>as Moonshine</ACTION> This lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present. Myself the man i’ th’ moon do seem to be. 

THESEUS This is the greatest error of all the rest; the	 man should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else “the man i’ th’ moon”? 

DEMETRIUS  He dares not come there for the candle, for you see, it is already in snuff. 

HIPPOLYTA  I am aweary of this moon. Would he would	 change. 

THESEUS It appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all reason, we must stay the time. 

LYSANDER Proceed, Moon.	 STARVELING, as Moonshine   All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon, I the man i’ th’ moon, this thornbush my thornbush, and this dog my dog. 

DEMETRIUS Why, all these should be in the lanthorn,	 for all these are in the moon. But silence. Here comes Thisbe. 

<ACTION>Enter Thisbe (Flute).</ACTION> 

FLUTE ,  <ACTION>as Thisbe</ACTION> This is old Ninny’s tomb. Where is my love? 

SNUG ,  <ACTION>as Lion</ACTION> O! 

<ACTION>The Lion roars. Thisbe runs off,dropping her mantle.</ACTION> 

DEMETRIUS Well roared, Lion.	 

THESEUS Well run, Thisbe. 

HIPPOLYTA Well shone, Moon. Truly, the Moon shines with a good grace. 

<ACTION>Lion worries the mantle.</ACTION> 

THESEUS Well moused, Lion. 

<ACTION>Enter Pyramus (Bottom).</ACTION> 

DEMETRIUS And then came Pyramus.	 

<ACTION>Lion exits.</ACTION> 

LYSANDER And so the lion vanished. 

BOTTOM , <ACTION> as Pyramus</ACTION> Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams. I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright, For by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams, I trust to take of truest Thisbe sight.—	 But stay! O spite! But mark, poor knight, What dreadful dole is here! Eyes, do you see! How can it be!	 O dainty duck! O dear! Thy mantle good— What, stained with blood? Approach, ye Furies fell! O Fates, come, come,	 Cut thread and thrum, Quail, crush, conclude, and quell! 

THESEUS This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would go near to make a man look sad. 

HIPPOLYTA Beshrew my heart but I pity the man.	 

BOTTOM ,  <ACTION>as Pyramus</ACTION> O, wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame, Since lion vile hath here deflowered my dear, Which is—no, no—which was the fairest dame That lived, that loved, that liked, that looked with cheer?	 Come, tears, confound! Out, sword, and wound The pap of Pyramus; Ay, that left pap, Where heart doth hop.	Pyramus stabs himself.   Thus die I, thus, thus, thus. Now am I dead; Now am I fled; My soul is in the sky. Tongue, lose thy light!	 Moon, take thy flight!	 <ACTION>Moonshine exits.</ACTION> Now die, die, die, die, die.	Pyramus falls. 

DEMETRIUS No die, but an ace for him, for he is but one. 

LYSANDER Less than an ace, man, for he is dead, he is	 nothing. 

THESEUS  With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and yet prove an ass. 

HIPPOLYTA How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes back and finds her lover?	 

THESEUS She will find him by starlight. 

<ACTION>Enter Thisbe (Flute).</ACTION> 

Here she comes, and her passion ends the play. 

HIPPOLYTA Methinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus. I hope she will be brief. 

DEMETRIUS A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus,	 which Thisbe, is the better: he for a man, God warrant us; she for a woman, God bless us. 

LYSANDER  She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes. 

DEMETRIUS And thus she means, videlicet—	 

FLUTE ,  <ACTION>as Thisbe</ACTION> Asleep, my love? What, dead, my dove? O Pyramus, arise! Speak, speak. Quite dumb? Dead? Dead? A tomb	 Must cover thy sweet eyes. These lily lips, This cherry nose, These yellow cowslip cheeks Are gone, are gone!	 Lovers, make moan; His eyes were green as leeks. O Sisters Three, Come, come to me With hands as pale as milk.	 Lay them in gore, Since you have shore With shears his thread of silk. Tongue, not a word! Come, trusty sword,	 Come, blade, my breast imbrue! <ACTION>Thisbe stabs herself.</ACTION> And farewell, friends. Thus Thisbe ends. Adieu, adieu, adieu.	 <ACTION>Thisbe falls.</ACTION> 

THESEUS Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the	 dead. 

DEMETRIUS Ay, and Wall too. 

<ACTION>Bottom and Flute arise.</ACTION> 

BOTTOM No, I assure you, the wall is down that parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the Epilogue or to hear a Bergomask dance between	 two of our company? 

THESEUS No epilogue, I pray you. For your play needs no excuse. Never excuse. For when the players are all dead, there need none to be blamed. Marry, if he that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged	 himself in Thisbe’s garter, it would have been a fine tragedy; and so it is, truly, and very notably discharged. But, come, your Bergomask. Let your epilogue alone. 

<ACTION>Dance, and the players exit.</ACTION> 

The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve.	 Lovers, to bed! ’Tis almost fairy time. I fear we shall outsleep the coming morn As much as we this night have overwatched. This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.	 A fortnight hold we this solemnity In nightly revels and new jollity.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Robin Goodfellow.</ACTION> 

ROBIN Now the hungry lion roars, And the wolf behowls the moon, Whilst the heavy plowman snores,	 All with weary task fordone. Now the wasted brands do glow, Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud, Puts the wretch that lies in woe In remembrance of a shroud.	 Now it is the time of night That the graves, all gaping wide, Every one lets forth his sprite In the church-way paths to glide. And we fairies, that do run	 By the triple Hecate’s team From the presence of the sun, Following darkness like a dream, Now are frolic. Not a mouse Shall disturb this hallowed house.	 I am sent with broom before, To sweep the dust behind the door. 

<ACTION>Enter Oberon and Titania, King and Queen of Fairies,with all their train.</ACTION> 

OBERON Through the house give glimmering light, By the dead and drowsy fire. Every elf and fairy sprite,	 Hop as light as bird from brier, And this ditty after me, Sing and dance it trippingly. 

TITANIA First rehearse your song by rote, To each word a warbling note.	 Hand in hand, with fairy grace, Will we sing and bless this place. Oberon leads the Fairies in song and dance. 

OBERON Now, until the break of day, Through this house each fairy stray. To the best bride-bed will we,	 Which by us shall blessèd be, And the issue there create Ever shall be fortunate. So shall all the couples three Ever true in loving be,	 And the blots of Nature’s hand Shall not in their issue stand. Never mole, harelip, nor scar, Nor mark prodigious, such as are Despisèd in nativity,	 Shall upon their children be. With this field-dew consecrate Every fairy take his gait, And each several chamber bless, Through this palace, with sweet peace.	 And the owner of it blest, Ever shall in safety rest. Trip away. Make no stay. Meet me all by break of day. 

<ACTION>All but Robin exit.</ACTION> 

ROBIN If we shadows have offended,	 Think but this and all is mended: That you have but slumbered here While these visions did appear. And this weak and idle theme, No more yielding but a dream,	 Gentles, do not reprehend. If you pardon, we will mend. And, as I am an honest Puck, If we have unearnèd luck Now to ’scape the serpent’s tongue,	 We will make amends ere long. Else the Puck a liar call. So good night unto you all. Give me your hands, if we be friends, And Robin shall restore amends.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
