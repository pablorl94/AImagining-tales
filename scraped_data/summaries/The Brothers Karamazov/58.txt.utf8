The prosecutor and the deputy commissioner search Dmitri's clothes, thinking he might have sewn his money into them, but find nothing. They discover some blood on his right cuff and take all the clothes in as evidence. They find some clothes from Kalganov for Dmitri to borrow.

The prosecutor informs Dmitri that Grigory's testimony conflicts with his story. Dmitri had said that the gate to the garden was closed, while Grigory insisted it was open. Puzzled, Dmitri is shown the envelope that had the money, and his exclamations only serve as further proof to his interrogators that he's guilty.

Frustrated, and now convinced that it must have been Smerdyakov who killed his father, Dmitri decides to confess an awful secret.
