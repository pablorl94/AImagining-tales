After Harpagon leaves, Valère laughs at Master Jacques for getting hit by an old man.

Jacques accuses Valère of being a spineless jerk, and then decides to play tough with him. He starts pushing Valère and telling him not to mess with him anymore. He also starts hurling insults at Valère.

Eventually, Valère gets fed up with all this posing and starts pushing Master Jacques back, telling him he's not so tough.

Master Jacques backs down right away and says he was just joking. Valère says that Master Jacques's jokes are terrible, and gives him a second beating.

After Valère leaves, Jacques swears revenge.
