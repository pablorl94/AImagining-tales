<ACTION>Romeo comes forward.</ACTION> 

ROMEO He jests at scars that never felt a wound. 

<ACTION>Enter Juliet above.</ACTION> 

But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the East, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief	 That thou, her maid, art far more fair than she. Be not her maid since she is envious. Her vestal livery is but sick and green, And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off. It is my lady. O, it is my love!	 O, that she knew she were! She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that? Her eye discourses; I will answer it. I am too bold. ’Tis not to me she speaks. Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,	 Having some business, do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return. What if her eyes were there, they in her head? The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars		 As daylight doth a lamp; her eye in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O, that I were a glove upon that hand,	 That I might touch that cheek! 

JULIET Ay me. 

ROMEO ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> She speaks. O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art As glorious to this night, being o’er my head,	30 As is a wingèd messenger of heaven Unto the white-upturnèd wond’ring eyes Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds And sails upon the bosom of the air.	35 

JULIET O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name, Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I’ll no longer be a Capulet. 

ROMEO ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?	 

JULIET ’Tis but thy name that is my enemy. Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What’s Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face. O, be some other name Belonging to a man.	 What’s in a name? That which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet. So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,	 And, for thy name, which is no part of thee, Take all myself. 

ROMEO I take thee at thy word. Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptized. Henceforth I never will be Romeo.	 

JULIET What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night, So stumblest on my counsel? 

ROMEO By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am. My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself	 Because it is an enemy to thee. Had I it written, I would tear the word. 

JULIET My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words Of thy tongue’s uttering, yet I know the sound. Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?	 

ROMEO Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike. 

JULIET How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.	 

ROMEO With love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls, For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do, that dares love attempt. Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me. 

JULIET If they do see thee, they will murder thee.	 

ROMEO Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet, And I am proof against their enmity. 

JULIET I would not for the world they saw thee here. 

ROMEO I have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,	 And, but thou love me, let them find me here. My life were better ended by their hate Than death proroguèd, wanting of thy love. 

JULIET By whose direction found’st thou out this place? 

ROMEO By love, that first did prompt me to inquire.	 He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes. I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea, I should adventure for such merchandise. 

JULIET Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,	 Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight. Fain would I dwell on form; fain, fain deny What I have spoke. But farewell compliment. Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say “Ay,”	 And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st, Thou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries, They say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully. Or, if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,	 I’ll frown and be perverse and say thee nay, So thou wilt woo, but else not for the world. In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond, And therefore thou mayst think my havior light. But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true	 Than those that have more coying to be strange. I should have been more strange, I must confess, But that thou overheard’st ere I was ware My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me, And not impute this yielding to light love,	 Which the dark night hath so discoverèd. 

ROMEO Lady, by yonder blessèd moon I vow, That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops— 

JULIET O, swear not by the moon, th’ inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb,	 Lest that thy love prove likewise variable. 

ROMEO What shall I swear by? 

JULIET  Do not swear at all. Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry,	 And I’ll believe thee. 

ROMEO  If my heart’s dear love— 

JULIET Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract tonight. It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden,	 Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say “It lightens.” Sweet, good night. This bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest	 Come to thy heart as that within my breast. 

ROMEO O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? 

JULIET What satisfaction canst thou have tonight? 

ROMEO Th’ exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine. 

JULIET I gave thee mine before thou didst request it,	 And yet I would it were to give again. 

ROMEO Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love? 

JULIET But to be frank and give it thee again. And yet I wish but for the thing I have. My bounty is as boundless as the sea,	 My love as deep. The more I give to thee, The more I have, for both are infinite. 

<ACTION>Nurse calls from within.</ACTION> 

I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.— Anon, good nurse.—Sweet Montague, be true. Stay but a little; I will come again.	 <ACTION>She exits.  </ACTION> 

ROMEO O blessèd, blessèd night! I am afeard, Being in night, all this is but a dream, Too flattering sweet to be substantial. 

<ACTION>Reenter Juliet above.</ACTION> 

JULIET Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honorable,	 Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow, By one that I’ll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite, And all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.	 

NURSE ,  <ACTION>within </ACTION> Madam. 

JULIET I come anon.—But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee— 

NURSE ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> Madam. 

JULIET By and by, I come.—	 To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. Tomorrow will I send. 

ROMEO So thrive my soul— 

JULIET A thousand times good night.	 

<ACTION>She exits.</ACTION> 

ROMEO A thousand times the worse to want thy light.	 Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks. <ACTION>Going.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Juliet above again.</ACTION> 

JULIET Hist, Romeo, hist! O, for a falc’ner’s voice To lure this tassel-gentle back again!	 Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud, Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine With repetition of “My Romeo!” 

ROMEO It is my soul that calls upon my name.	 How silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night, Like softest music to attending ears. 

JULIET Romeo. 

ROMEO  My dear. 

JULIET What o’clock tomorrow	 Shall I send to thee? 

ROMEO By the hour of nine. 

JULIET I will not fail. ’Tis twenty year till then. I have forgot why I did call thee back. 

ROMEO Let me stand here till thou remember it.	 

JULIET I shall forget, to have thee still stand there, Rememb’ring how I love thy company. 

ROMEO And I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget, Forgetting any other home but this. 

JULIET ’Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone,	 And yet no farther than a wanton’s bird, That lets it hop a little from his hand, Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, And with a silken thread plucks it back again, So loving-jealous of his liberty.	 

ROMEO I would I were thy bird. 

JULIET  Sweet, so would I. Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing. Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow	 That I shall say “Good night” till it be morrow. 

<ACTION>She exits.</ACTION> 

ROMEO Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast. Would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest. Hence will I to my ghostly friar’s close cell, His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
