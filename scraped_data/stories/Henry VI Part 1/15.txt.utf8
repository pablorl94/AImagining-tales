<ACTION>Enter Talbot with Soldiers and Trump and Drumbefore Bordeaux.</ACTION> 

TALBOT Go to the gates of Bordeaux, trumpeter. Summon their general unto the wall. 

<ACTION>Trumpet sounds. Enter General and Others aloft.</ACTION> 

English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth, Servant-in-arms to Harry, King of England, And thus he would: open your city gates,	 Be humble to us, call my sovereign yours, And do him homage as obedient subjects, And I’ll withdraw me and my bloody power. But if you frown upon this proffered peace, You tempt the fury of my three attendants,	 Lean Famine, quartering Steel, and climbing Fire, Who, in a moment, even with the earth Shall lay your stately and air-braving towers, If you forsake the offer of their love. 

GENERAL Thou ominous and fearful owl of death,	 Our nation’s terror and their bloody scourge, The period of thy tyranny approacheth. On us thou canst not enter but by death; For I protest we are well fortified And strong enough to issue out and fight.	 If thou retire, the Dauphin, well appointed, Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee. On either hand thee, there are squadrons pitched To wall thee from the liberty of flight; And no way canst thou turn thee for redress	 But Death doth front thee with apparent spoil, And pale Destruction meets thee in the face. Ten thousand French have ta’en the Sacrament To rive their dangerous artillery Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot.	 Lo, there thou stand’st, a breathing valiant man Of an invincible unconquered spirit. This is the latest glory of thy praise That I, thy enemy, due thee withal; For ere the glass that now begins to run	 Finish the process of his sandy hour, These eyes, that see thee now well-colorèd, Shall see thee withered, bloody, pale, and dead. 

<ACTION>Drum afar off.</ACTION> 

Hark, hark, the Dauphin’s drum, a warning bell, Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul,	 And mine shall ring thy dire departure out. 

<ACTION>He exits, aloft, with Others.</ACTION> 

TALBOT He fables not; I hear the enemy. Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings. Some Soldiers exit. O, negligent and heedless discipline, How are we parked and bounded in a pale,	 A little herd of England’s timorous deer Mazed with a yelping kennel of French curs. If we be English deer, be then in blood, Not rascal-like to fall down with a pinch, But rather, moody-mad and desperate stags, Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel And make the cowards stand aloof at bay. Sell every man his life as dear as mine And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends. God and Saint George, Talbot and England’s right,	 Prosper our colors in this dangerous fight! 

<ACTION>He exits with Soldiers, Drum and Trumpet.</ACTION>
