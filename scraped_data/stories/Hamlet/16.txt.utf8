HORATIO <ACTION>reads the letter</ACTION> 

"Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked this, give these fellows some means to the King. They have letters for him. Ere we were two days	 old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled valor, and in the grapple I boarded them. On the instant, they got clear of our ship; so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like	 thieves of mercy, but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn for them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too	 light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England; of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell. He that thou knowest thine,	 Hamlet." 

Come, I will give you way for these your letters And do ’t the speedier that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
