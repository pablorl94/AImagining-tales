<ACTION>Enter Salarino and Solanio.</ACTION> 

SALARINO Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail; With him is Gratiano gone along; And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not. 

SOLANIO The villain Jew with outcries raised the Duke, Who went with him to search Bassanio’s ship. 

SALARINO He came too late; the ship was under sail. But there the Duke was given to understand That in a gondola were seen together Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica. Besides, Antonio certified the Duke	 They were not with Bassanio in his ship. 

SOLANIO I never heard a passion so confused, So strange, outrageous, and so variable As the dog Jew did utter in the streets. “My daughter, O my ducats, O my daughter!	 Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats! Justice, the law, my ducats, and my daughter, A sealèd bag, two sealèd bags of ducats, Of double ducats, stol’n from me by my daughter, And jewels—two stones, two rich and precious	 stones— Stol’n by my daughter! Justice! Find the girl! She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.” 

SALARINO Why, all the boys in Venice follow him, Crying “His stones, his daughter, and his ducats.”	 

SOLANIO Let good Antonio look he keep his day, Or he shall pay for this. 

SALARINO Marry, well remembered. I reasoned with a Frenchman yesterday Who told me, in the Narrow Seas that part	 The French and English, there miscarrièd A vessel of our country richly fraught. I thought upon Antonio when he told me, And wished in silence that it were not his. 

SOLANIO You were best to tell Antonio what you hear—	 Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him. 

SALARINO A kinder gentleman treads not the Earth. I saw Bassanio and Antonio part. Bassanio told him he would make some speed Of his return. He answered “Do not so.	 Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio, But stay the very riping of the time; And for the Jew’s bond which he hath of me, Let it not enter in your mind of love. Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts	 To courtship and such fair ostents of love As shall conveniently become you there.” And even there, his eye being big with tears, Turning his face, he put his hand behind him, And with affection wondrous sensible	 He wrung Bassanio’s hand—and so they parted. 

SOLANIO I think he only loves the world for him. I pray thee, let us go and find him out And quicken his embracèd heaviness With some delight or other.	 

SALARINO Do we so.
