SCENE VIII.--ÉLISE, VALÈRE. 

ELI. Surely, Valère, you are not in earnest when you speak to him in that manner? 

VAL. I do it that I may not vex him, and the better to secure my ends. To resist him boldly would simply spoil everything. There are certain people who are only to be managed by indirect means, temperaments averse from all resistance, restive natures whom truth causes to rear, who always kick when we would lead them on the right road of reason, and who can only be led by a way opposed to that by which you wish them to go. Pretend to comply with his wishes; you are much more likely to succeed in the end, and ... 

ELI. But this marriage, Valère? 

VAL. We will find some pretext for breaking it off. 

ELI. But what pretext can we find if it is to be concluded to-night? 

VAL. You must ask to have it delayed, and must feign some illness or other. 

ELI. But he will soon discover the truth if they call in the doctor. 

VAL. Not a bit of it. Do you imagine that a doctor understands what he is about? Nonsense! Don't be afraid. Believe me, you may complain of any disease you please, the doctor will be at no loss to explain to you from what it proceeds.
