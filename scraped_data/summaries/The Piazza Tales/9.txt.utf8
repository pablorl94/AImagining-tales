Hey, there's a quote from Spenser. Hello quote from Spenser.

Melville tells you that Barrington Island was the home of pirates, or buccaneers.

Its isolation meant that pirates could hang out without fear of being hunted down and arrested.

Barrington Island has trees and fruit and is generally pleasant, unlike all the other islands around. Thus a happy place for pirates.

The narrative quotes some unknown sentimental traveler. Why? Maybe because random quotation is fun?

Anyway, the random quotation and Melville agree that pirates are awful, but argue that some of them are maybe not so bad.

You wonder what the random quotation person would say if pirates robbed him. But that we shall never know.
