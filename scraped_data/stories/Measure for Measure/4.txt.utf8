<ACTION>Enter Angelo, Escalus, Servants, and a Justice.</ACTION> 

ANGELO We must not make a scarecrow of the law, Setting it up to fear the birds of prey, And let it keep one shape till custom make it Their perch and not their terror. 

ESCALUS Ay, but yet	 Let us be keen and rather cut a little Than fall and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman Whom I would save had a most noble father. Let but your Honor know, Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,	 That, in the working of your own affections, Had time cohered with place, or place with wishing, Or that the resolute acting of your blood Could have attained th’ effect of your own purpose, Whether you had not sometime in your life	 Erred in this point which now you censure him, And pulled the law upon you. 

ANGELO ’Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus, Another thing to fall. I not deny The jury passing on the prisoner’s life	 May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two Guiltier than him they try. What’s open made to justice, That justice seizes. What knows the laws That thieves do pass on thieves? ’Tis very pregnant,	 The jewel that we find, we stoop and take ’t Because we see it; but what we do not see, We tread upon and never think of it. You may not so extenuate his offense For I have had such faults; but rather tell me, When I that censure him do so offend, Let mine own judgment pattern out my death, And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die. 

<ACTION>Enter Provost.</ACTION> 

ESCALUS Be it as your wisdom will. 

ANGELO Where is the Provost?	 

PROVOST Here, if it like your Honor. 

ANGELO  See that Claudio Be executed by nine tomorrow morning. Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared, For that’s the utmost of his pilgrimage.	 

<ACTION>Provost exits.</ACTION> 

ESCALUS Well, heaven forgive him and forgive us all. Some rise by sin and some by virtue fall. Some run from brakes of ice and answer none, And some condemnèd for a fault alone. 

<ACTION>Enter Elbow and Officers, with Frothand Pompey.</ACTION> 

ELBOW ,  <ACTION>to Officers</ACTION> Come, bring them away. If these	 be good people in a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in common houses, I know no law. Bring them away. 

ANGELO How now, sir, what’s your name? And what’s the matter?	 

ELBOW If it please your Honor, I am the poor duke’s constable, and my name is Elbow. I do lean upon justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good Honor two notorious benefactors. 

ANGELO  Benefactors? Well, what benefactors are they?	 Are they not malefactors? 

ELBOW If it please your Honor, I know not well what they are, but precise villains they are, that I am sure of, and void of all profanation in the world that good Christians ought to have.	 

ESCALUS ,  <ACTION>to Angelo</ACTION> This comes off well. Here’s a wise officer. 

ANGELO ,  <ACTION>to Elbow </ACTION> Go to. What quality are they of? Elbow is your name? Why dost thou not speak, Elbow?	 

POMPEY He cannot, sir. He’s out at elbow. 

ANGELO  What are you, sir? 

ELBOW He, sir? A tapster, sir, parcel bawd; one that serves a bad woman, whose house, sir, was, as they say, plucked down in the suburbs, and now she	 professes a hothouse, which I think is a very ill house too. 

ESCALUS How know you that? 

ELBOW My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your Honor—	 

ESCALUS How? Thy wife? 

ELBOW Ay, sir, whom I thank heaven is an honest woman— 

ESCALUS Dost thou detest her therefore? 

ELBOW I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as she,	 that this house, if it be not a bawd’s house, it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house. 

ESCALUS How dost thou know that, constable? 

ELBOW Marry, sir, by my wife, who, if she had been a woman cardinally given, might have been accused	 in fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there. 

ESCALUS By the woman’s means? 

ELBOW Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone’s means; but as she spit in his face, so she defied him.	 

POMPEY ,  <ACTION>to Escalus</ACTION> Sir, if it please your Honor, this is not so. 

ELBOW Prove it before these varlets here, thou honorable man, prove it. 

ESCALUS ,  <ACTION>to Angelo</ACTION> Do you hear how he misplaces?	 

POMPEY  Sir, she came in great with child, and longing, saving your Honor’s reverence, for stewed prunes. Sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit dish, a dish of some threepence; your Honors have seen such	 dishes; they are not china dishes, but very good dishes— 

ESCALUS  Go to, go to. No matter for the dish, sir. 

POMPEY  No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in the right. But to the point: as I say, this Mistress	 Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said, Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very honestly—for, as	 you know, Master Froth, I could not give you threepence again— 

FROTH  No, indeed. 

POMPEY Very well. You being then, if you be remembered, cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes—	 

FROTH  Ay, so I did indeed. 

POMPEY Why, very well. I telling you then, if you be remembered, that such a one and such a one were past cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very good diet, as I told you—	 

FROTH All this is true. 

POMPEY Why, very well then— 

ESCALUS  Come, you are a tedious fool. To the purpose: what was done to Elbow’s wife that he hath cause to complain of? Come me to what was done to her.	 

POMPEY Sir, your Honor cannot come to that yet. 

ESCALUS  No, sir, nor I mean it not. 

POMPEY Sir, but you shall come to it, by your Honor’s leave. And I beseech you, look into Master Froth here, sir, a man of fourscore pound a year, whose	 father died at Hallowmas—was ’t not at Hallowmas, Master Froth? 

FROTH  All-hallond Eve. 

POMPEY Why, very well. I hope here be truths.—He, sir, sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir— <ACTION>To Froth.</ACTION> ’Twas in the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight to sit, have you not? 

FROTH I have so, because it is an open room, and good for winter. 

POMPEY Why, very well then. I hope here be truths.	 

ANGELO ,  <ACTION>to Escalus</ACTION> This will last out a night in Russia When nights are longest there. I’ll take my leave, And leave you to the hearing of the cause, Hoping you’ll find good cause to whip them all. 

ESCALUS I think no less. Good morrow to your Lordship	 

<ACTION>Angelo exits.</ACTION> 

Now, sir, come on. What was done to Elbow’s wife, once more? 

POMPEY Once, sir? There was nothing done to her once. 

ELBOW ,  <ACTION>to Escalus</ACTION> I beseech you, sir, ask him what	 this man did to my wife. 

POMPEY ,  <ACTION>to Escalus</ACTION> I beseech your Honor, ask me. 

ESCALUS  Well, sir, what did this gentleman to her? 

POMPEY  I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman’s face.—Good Master Froth, look upon his Honor.	 ’Tis for a good purpose.—Doth your Honor mark his face? 

ESCALUS Ay, sir, very well. 

POMPEY  Nay, I beseech you, mark it well. 

ESCALUS Well, I do so.	 

POMPEY  Doth your Honor see any harm in his face? 

ESCALUS Why, no. 

POMPEY I’ll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst thing about him. Good, then, if his face be the worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do	1 the Constable’s wife any harm? I would know that of your Honor. 

ESCALUS  He’s in the right, constable. What say you to it? 

ELBOW First, an it like you, the house is a respected	 house; next, this is a respected fellow, and his mistress is a respected woman. 

POMPEY  By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected person than any of us all. 

ELBOW Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! The	 time is yet to come that she was ever respected with man, woman, or child. 

POMPEY Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her. 

ESCALUS Which is the wiser here, Justice or Iniquity?	 Is this true? 

ELBOW ,  <ACTION>to Pompey</ACTION> O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married to her?—If ever I was respected with her, or she with me, let not your Worship think me	 the poor duke’s officer.—Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or I’ll have mine action of batt’ry on thee. 

ESCALUS If he took you a box o’ th’ ear, you might have your action of slander too. 

ELBOW Marry, I thank your good Worship for it. What	 is ’t your Worship’s pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff? 

ESCALUS Truly, officer, because he hath some offenses in him that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him continue in his courses till thou know’st	 what they are. 

ELBOW Marry, I thank your Worship for it.  <ACTION>To Pompey.</ACTION> Thou seest, thou wicked varlet, now, what’s come upon thee. Thou art to continue now, thou varlet, thou art to continue.	 

ESCALUS , <ACTION> to Froth</ACTION> Where were you born, friend? 

FROTH  Here in Vienna, sir. 

ESCALUS  Are you of fourscore pounds a year? 

FROTH  Yes, an ’t please you, sir. 

ESCALUS So.  <ACTION>To Pompey.</ACTION> What trade are you of, sir?	 

POMPEY  A tapster, a poor widow’s tapster. 

ESCALUS Your mistress’ name? 

POMPEY  Mistress Overdone. 

ESCALUS Hath she had any more than one husband? 

POMPEY Nine, sir. Overdone by the last.	 

ESCALUS  Nine?—Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master Froth, I would not have you acquainted with tapsters; they will draw you, Master Froth, and you will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no more of you.	 

FROTH I thank your Worship. For mine own part, I never come into any room in a taphouse but I am drawn in. 

ESCALUS Well, no more of it, Master Froth. Farewell. 

<ACTION>Froth exits.</ACTION> 

Come you hither to me, Master Tapster. What’s your	 name, Master Tapster? 

POMPEY Pompey. 

ESCALUS  What else? 

POMPEY Bum, sir. 

ESCALUS  Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing	 about you, so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey, howsoever you color it in being a tapster, are you not? Come, tell me true. It shall be the better for you.	 

POMPEY Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live. 

ESCALUS How would you live, Pompey? By being a bawd? What do you think of the trade, Pompey? Is it a lawful trade? 

POMPEY If the law would allow it, sir. 

ESCALUS But the law will not allow it, Pompey, nor it shall not be allowed in Vienna. 

POMPEY Does your Worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of the city? 

ESCALUS No, Pompey.	 

POMPEY Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to ’t then. If your Worship will take order for the drabs and the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds. 

ESCALUS There is pretty orders beginning, I can tell you. It is but heading and hanging.	 

POMPEY If you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten year together, you’ll be glad to give out a commission for more heads. If this law hold in Vienna ten year, I’ll rent the fairest house in it after threepence a bay. If you live to see this come to	 pass, say Pompey told you so. 

ESCALUS Thank you, good Pompey. And in requital of your prophecy, hark you: I advise you let me not find you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever; no, not for dwelling where you do. If I	 do, Pompey, I shall beat you to your tent and prove a shrewd Caesar to you. In plain dealing, Pompey, I shall have you whipped. So, for this time, Pompey, fare you well. 

POMPEY I thank your Worship for your good counsel.	 <ACTION>Aside.</ACTION> But I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall better determine. Whip me? No, no, let carman whip his jade. The valiant heart’s not whipped out of his trade. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

ESCALUS  Come hither to me, Master Elbow. Come	 hither, Master Constable. How long have you been in this place of constable? 

ELBOW  Seven year and a half, sir. 

ESCALUS I thought, by the readiness in the office, you had continued in it some time. You say seven years	 together? 

ELBOW  And a half, sir. 

ESCALUS Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you wrong to put you so oft upon ’t. Are there not men in your ward sufficient to serve it?	 

ELBOW Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters. As they are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them. I do it for some piece of money and go through with all. 

ESCALUS Look you bring me in the names of some six	 or seven, the most sufficient of your parish. 

ELBOW To your Worship’s house, sir? 

ESCALUS To my house. Fare you well. 

<ACTION>Elbow and Officers exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>To Justice.</ACTION> What’s o’clock, think you? 

JUSTICE  Eleven, sir.	 

ESCALUS I pray you home to dinner with me. 

JUSTICE I humbly thank you. 

ESCALUS It grieves me for the death of Claudio, But there’s no remedy. 

JUSTICE Lord Angelo is severe.	 

ESCALUS It is but needful. Mercy is not itself that oft looks so. Pardon is still the nurse of second woe. But yet, poor Claudio. There is no remedy. Come, sir.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
