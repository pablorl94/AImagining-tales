Chapter 3.XXII. 

King William, said my uncle Toby, addressing himself to Yorick, was so terribly provoked at count Solmes for disobeying his orders, that he would not suffer him to come into his presence for many months after.--I fear, answered Yorick, the squire will be as much provoked at the corporal, as the King at the count.--But 'twould be singularly hard in this case, continued be, if corporal Trim, who has behaved so diametrically opposite to count Solmes, should have the fate to be rewarded with the same disgrace:--too oft in this world, do things take that train.--I would spring a mine, cried my uncle Toby, rising up,--and blow up my fortifications, and my house with them, and we would perish under their ruins, ere I would stand by and see it.--Trim directed a slight,--but a grateful bow towards his master,--and so the chapter ends.
