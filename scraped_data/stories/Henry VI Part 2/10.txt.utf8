<ACTION>Enter King Henry, Salisbury and Warwick, to theCardinal in bed, raving and staring.</ACTION> 

KING HENRY How fares my lord? Speak, Beaufort, to thy sovereign. 

CARDINAL If thou be’st Death, I’ll give thee England’s treasure, Enough to purchase such another island, So thou wilt let me live and feel no pain. 

KING HENRY Ah, what a sign it is of evil life,	 Where Death’s approach is seen so terrible! 

WARWICK Beaufort, it is thy sovereign speaks to thee. 

CARDINAL Bring me unto my trial when you will. Died he not in his bed? Where should he die? Can I make men live, whe’er they will or no?	 O, torture me no more! I will confess. Alive again? Then show me where he is. I’ll give a thousand pound to look upon him. He hath no eyes! The dust hath blinded them. Comb down his hair. Look, look. It stands upright,	 Like lime-twigs set to catch my wingèd soul. Give me some drink, and bid the apothecary Bring the strong poison that I bought of him. 

KING HENRY O, Thou eternal mover of the heavens, Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch!	 O, beat away the busy meddling fiend That lays strong siege unto this wretch’s soul, And from his bosom purge this black despair! 

WARWICK See how the pangs of death do make him grin! 

SALISBURY Disturb him not. Let him pass peaceably.	 

KING HENRY Peace to his soul, if God’s good pleasure be!— Lord Card’nal, if thou think’st on heaven’s bliss, Hold up thy hand; make signal of thy hope. 

<ACTION>The Cardinal dies.</ACTION> 

He dies and makes no sign. O, God forgive him! 

WARWICK So bad a death argues a monstrous life. 

KING HENRY Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all. Close up his eyes, and draw the curtain close, And let us all to meditation. 

<ACTION>After the curtains are closed aroundthe bed, they exit. The bed is removed.</ACTION>
