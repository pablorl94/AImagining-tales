Back to Maggie, a pretty young girl in a dilapidated tenement. What hope does she have growing up on Rum Alley? Her delicate beauty is lost on her co-workers at the sweatshop, where she sews collars and cuffs.

Jimmie's in charge of the house now. Drunken Mary is still around, getting into scraps and developing her own relationship with police justices. Let's just say she's on a first-name basis with the local Bowery cops.

Then along comes Peteâ€”he's that guy who saved Jimmie's tail when he was getting into it with those Devil's Row urchins oh so many years ago.

Through Maggie's eyes, Pete is a hunk and a savior. His contempt for the world and air of superiority floats her boat; she's all in.

As she stares Pete down, Maggie becomes hyper-aware of the filth and disarray of her home. Compared to this noble gentleman (her thoughts), her surroundings are an embarrassment.

She decides that he is the "ideal man" (5.25).
