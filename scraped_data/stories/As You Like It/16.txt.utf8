FIRST LORD Sir, it was I. 

JAQUES ,  <ACTION>to the other Lords</ACTION> Let’s present him to the Duke like a Roman conqueror. And it would do well to set the deer’s horns upon his head for a branch of	 victory.—Have you no song, forester, for this purpose? 

SECOND LORD Yes, sir. 

JAQUES Sing it. ’Tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise enough.	 

<ACTION>Music. Song.</ACTION> 

SECOND LORD  <ACTION>sings</ACTION> "What shall he have that killed the deer? His leather skin and horns to wear. Then sing him home. 

"(The rest shall bear this burden:) 

"Take thou no scorn to wear the horn. It was a crest ere thou wast born.	 Thy father’s father wore it, And thy father bore it. The horn, the horn, the lusty horn Is not a thing to laugh to scorn."
