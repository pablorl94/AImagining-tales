<ACTION>Enter the two Tribunes. Sicinius and Brutus.</ACTION> 

SICINIUS We hear not of him, neither need we fear him. His remedies are tame—the present peace, And quietness of the people, which before Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,	 Though they themselves did suffer by ’t, behold Dissentious numbers pest’ring streets than see Our tradesmen singing in their shops and going About their functions friendly. 

BRUTUS We stood to ’t in good time.	 

<ACTION>Enter Menenius.</ACTION> 

Is this Menenius? 

SICINIUS ’Tis he, ’tis he. O, he is grown most kind Of late.—Hail, sir. 

MENENIUS Hail to you both. 

SICINIUS Your Coriolanus is not much missed	 But with his friends. The commonwealth doth stand, And so would do were he more angry at it. 

MENENIUS All’s well, and might have been much better if He could have temporized. 

SICINIUS Where is he, hear you?	 

MENENIUS Nay, I hear nothing; His mother and his wife hear nothing from him. 

<ACTION>Enter three or four Citizens.</ACTION> 

ALL CITIZENS , to the Tribunes The gods preserve you both! 

SICINIUS Good e’en, our neighbors.	 

BRUTUS Good e’en to you all, good e’en to you all. 

FIRST CITIZEN Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees Are bound to pray for you both. 

SICINIUS Live, and thrive! 

BRUTUS Farewell, kind neighbors. We wished Coriolanus	 Had loved you as we did. 

ALL CITIZENS Now the gods keep you! 

BOTH TRIBUNES Farewell, farewell.	 <ACTION>Citizens exit.</ACTION> 

SICINIUS This is a happier and more comely time Than when these fellows ran about the streets	 Crying confusion. 

BRUTUS Caius Martius was A worthy officer i’ th’ war, but insolent, O’ercome with pride, ambitious, past all thinking Self-loving.	 

SICINIUS And affecting one sole throne, without assistance. 

MENENIUS I think not so. 

SICINIUS We should by this, to all our lamentation, If he had gone forth consul, found it so. 

BRUTUS The gods have well prevented it, and Rome	 Sits safe and still without him. 

<ACTION>Enter an Aedile.</ACTION> 

AEDILE Worthy tribunes, There is a slave, whom we have put in prison, Reports the Volsces with two several powers Are entered in the Roman territories,	 And with the deepest malice of the war Destroy what lies before ’em. 

MENENIUS ’Tis Aufidius, Who, hearing of our Martius’ banishment, Thrusts forth his horns again into the world,	 Which were inshelled when Martius stood for Rome, And durst not once peep out. 

SICINIUS Come, what talk you of Martius? 

BRUTUS Go see this rumorer whipped. It cannot be The Volsces dare break with us.	 

MENENIUS Cannot be? We have record that very well it can, And three examples of the like hath been Within my age. But reason with the fellow Before you punish him, where he heard this,	 Lest you shall chance to whip your information And beat the messenger who bids beware Of what is to be dreaded. 

SICINIUS Tell not me. I know this cannot be.	 

BRUTUS Not possible. 

<ACTION>Enter a Messenger.</ACTION> 

MESSENGER The nobles in great earnestness are going All to the Senate House. Some news is coming That turns their countenances. 

SICINIUS ’Tis this slave—	 Go whip him ’fore the people’s eyes—his raising, Nothing but his report. 

MESSENGER Yes, worthy sir, The slave’s report is seconded, and more, More fearful, is delivered.	 

SICINIUS What more fearful? 

MESSENGER It is spoke freely out of many mouths— How probable I do not know—that Martius, Joined with Aufidius, leads a power ’gainst Rome And vows revenge as spacious as between	 The young’st and oldest thing. 

SICINIUS This is most likely! 

BRUTUS Raised only that the weaker sort may wish Good Martius home again. 

SICINIUS The very trick on ’t.	 

MENENIUS This is unlikely; He and Aufidius can no more atone Than violent’st contrariety. 

<ACTION>Enter a Second Messenger.</ACTION> 

SECOND MESSENGER You are sent for to the Senate. A fearful army, led by Caius Martius	 Associated with Aufidius, rages Upon our territories, and have already O’erborne their way, consumed with fire and took What lay before them. 

<ACTION>Enter Cominius.</ACTION> 

COMINIUS ,  <ACTION>to the Tribunes </ACTION> O, you have made good	 work! 

MENENIUS What news? What news? 

COMINIUS ,  <ACTION>to the Tribunes</ACTION> You have holp to ravish your own daughters and To melt the city leads upon your pates, To see your wives dishonored to your noses—	 

MENENIUS What’s the news? What’s the news? 

COMINIUS ,  <ACTION>to the Tribunes</ACTION> Your temples burnèd in their cement, and Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined Into an auger’s bore. 

MENENIUS Pray now, your news?—	 You have made fair work, I fear me.—Pray, your news? If Martius should be joined with Volscians— 

COMINIUS If? He is their god; he leads them like a thing	 Made by some other deity than Nature, That shapes man better; and they follow him Against us brats with no less confidence Than boys pursuing summer butterflies Or butchers killing flies.	 

MENENIUS ,  <ACTION>to the Tribunes </ACTION> You have made good work, You and your apron-men, you that stood so much Upon the voice of occupation and The breath of garlic eaters! 

COMINIUS He’ll shake your Rome about your ears.	 

MENENIUS As Hercules did shake down mellow fruit. You have made fair work. 

BRUTUS But is this true, sir? 

COMINIUS Ay, and you’ll look pale Before you find it other. All the regions	 Do smilingly revolt, and who resists Are mocked for valiant ignorance And perish constant fools. Who is ’t can blame him? Your enemies and his find something in him. 

MENENIUS We are all undone, unless	 The noble man have mercy. 

COMINIUS Who shall ask it? The Tribunes cannot do ’t for shame; the people Deserve such pity of him as the wolf Does of the shepherds. For his best friends, if they	 Should say “Be good to Rome,” they charged him even As those should do that had deserved his hate And therein showed like enemies. 

MENENIUS ’Tis true.	 If he were putting to my house the brand That should consume it, I have not the face To say “Beseech you, cease.”—You have made fair hands, You and your crafts! You have crafted fair!	 

COMINIUS You have brought A trembling upon Rome such as was never S’ incapable of help. 

TRIBUNES Say not we brought it.	 

MENENIUS How? Was ’t we? We loved him, but like beasts And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters, Who did hoot him out o’ th’ city. 

COMINIUS But I fear They’ll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,	 The second name of men, obeys his points As if he were his officer. Desperation Is all the policy, strength, and defense That Rome can make against them. 

<ACTION>Enter a troop of Citizens.</ACTION> 

MENENIUS Here come the	 clusters.— And is Aufidius with him? You are they That made the air unwholesome when you cast Your stinking, greasy caps in hooting at Coriolanus’ exile. Now he’s coming,	 And not a hair upon a soldier’s head Which will not prove a whip. As many coxcombs As you threw caps up will he tumble down And pay you for your voices. ’Tis no matter. If he could burn us all into one coal,	 We have deserved it. 

ALL CITIZENS Faith, we hear fearful news. 

FIRST CITIZEN  For mine own part, When I said banish him, I said ’twas pity. 

SECOND CITIZEN And so did I.	 

THIRD CITIZEN  And so did I. And, to say the truth, so did very many of us. That we did we did for the best; and though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet it was against our will. 

COMINIUS You’re goodly things, you voices!	 

MENENIUS You have made good work, you and your cry!— Shall ’s to the Capitol? 

COMINIUS O, ay, what else?	 <ACTION>Both exit.</ACTION> 

SICINIUS Go, masters, get you home. Be not dismayed. These are a side that would be glad to have	 This true which they so seem to fear. Go home, And show no sign of fear. 

FIRST CITIZEN The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let’s home. I ever said we were i’ th’ wrong when we banished him.	 

SECOND CITIZEN  So did we all. But, come, let’s home. 

<ACTION>Citizens exit.</ACTION> 

BRUTUS I do not like this news. 

SICINIUS Nor I. 

BRUTUS Let’s to the Capitol. Would half my wealth Would buy this for a lie.	 

SICINIUS Pray, let’s go. 

<ACTION>Tribunes exit.</ACTION>
