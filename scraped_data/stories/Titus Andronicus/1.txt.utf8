AARON Now climbeth Tamora Olympus’ top, Safe out of Fortune’s shot, and sits aloft, Secure of thunder’s crack or lightning flash, Advanced above pale Envy’s threat’ning reach. As when the golden sun salutes the morn	 And, having gilt the ocean with his beams, Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach And overlooks the highest-peering hills, So Tamora. Upon her wit doth earthly honor wait,	 And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown. Then, Aaron, arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress, And mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long Hast prisoner held, fettered in amorous chains	 And faster bound to Aaron’s charming eyes Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus. Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts! I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold To wait upon this new-made emperess.	 To wait, said I? To wanton with this queen, This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph, This siren that will charm Rome’s Saturnine And see his shipwrack and his commonweal’s. Holla! What storm is this?	 

<ACTION>Enter Chiron and Demetrius, braving.</ACTION> 

DEMETRIUS Chiron, thy years wants wit, thy wits wants edge And manners, to intrude where I am graced, And may, for aught thou knowest, affected be. 

CHIRON Demetrius, thou dost overween in all, And so in this, to bear me down with braves. ’Tis not the difference of a year or two Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate. I am as able and as fit as thou To serve and to deserve my mistress’ grace, And that my sword upon thee shall approve	 And plead my passions for Lavinia’s love. 

AARON ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Clubs, clubs! These lovers will not keep the peace. 

DEMETRIUS ,  <ACTION>to Chiron</ACTION> Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised, Gave you a dancing rapier by your side, Are you so desperate grown to threat your friends?	 Go to. Have your lath glued within your sheath Till you know better how to handle it. 

CHIRON Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have, Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare. 

DEMETRIUS Ay, boy, grow you so brave?	 <ACTION>They draw.  </ACTION> 

AARON Why, how now, lords? So near the Emperor’s palace dare you draw And maintain such a quarrel openly? Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge. I would not for a million of gold	 The cause were known to them it most concerns, Nor would your noble mother for much more Be so dishonored in the court of Rome. For shame, put up. 

DEMETRIUS Not I, till I have sheathed	 My rapier in his bosom, and withal Thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat That he hath breathed in my dishonor here. 

CHIRON For that I am prepared and full resolved, Foul-spoken coward, that thund’rest with thy tongue	 And with thy weapon nothing dar’st perform. 

AARON Away, I say! Now by the gods that warlike Goths adore, This petty brabble will undo us all. Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous	 It is to jet upon a prince’s right? What, is Lavinia then become so loose Or Bassianus so degenerate That for her love such quarrels may be broached Without controlment, justice, or revenge?	 Young lords, beware! And should the Empress know This discord’s ground, the music would not please. 

CHIRON I care not, I, knew she and all the world. I love Lavinia more than all the world. 

DEMETRIUS Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice.	 Lavinia is thine elder brother’s hope. 

AARON Why, are you mad? Or know you not in Rome How furious and impatient they be, And cannot brook competitors in love? I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths	 By this device. 

CHIRON Aaron, a thousand deaths Would I propose to achieve her whom I love. 

AARON To achieve her how? 

DEMETRIUS Why makes thou it so strange?	 She is a woman, therefore may be wooed; She is a woman, therefore may be won; She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved. What, man, more water glideth by the mill Than wots the miller of, and easy it is	 Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know. Though Bassianus be the Emperor’s brother, Better than he have worn Vulcan’s badge. 

AARON ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Ay, and as good as Saturninus may. 

DEMETRIUS Then why should he despair that knows to court it	 With words, fair looks, and liberality? What, hast not thou full often struck a doe And borne her cleanly by the keeper’s nose? 

AARON Why, then, it seems some certain snatch or so Would serve your turns.	 

CHIRON Ay, so the turn were served. 

DEMETRIUS Aaron, thou hast hit it. 

AARON Would you had hit it too! Then should not we be tired with this ado. Why, hark you, hark you! And are you such fools	 To square for this? Would it offend you then That both should speed? 

CHIRON Faith, not me. 

DEMETRIUS Nor me, so I were one. 

AARON For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar. ’Tis policy and stratagem must do That you affect, and so must you resolve That what you cannot as you would achieve, You must perforce accomplish as you may. Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste	 Than this Lavinia, Bassianus’ love. A speedier course than ling’ring languishment Must we pursue, and I have found the path. My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand; There will the lovely Roman ladies troop. The forest walks are wide and spacious, And many unfrequented plots there are, Fitted by kind for rape and villainy. Single you thither then this dainty doe, And strike her home by force, if not by words. This way, or not at all, stand you in hope. Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit To villainy and vengeance consecrate, Will we acquaint withal what we intend, And she shall file our engines with advice	 That will not suffer you to square yourselves, But to your wishes’ height advance you both. The Emperor’s court is like the house of Fame, The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears; The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull. 

There speak and strike, brave boys, and take your turns.There serve your lust, shadowed from heaven’s eye, And revel in Lavinia’s treasury. 

CHIRON Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice.	 

DEMETRIUS <ACTION>Sit fas aut nefas</ACTION> , till I find the stream To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits, <ACTION>Per Stygia, per manes vehor.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
