<ACTION>Enter Prince John and his army.</ACTION> 

MOWBRAY , to the Archbishop Your Grace of York, in God’s name then set forward.	 

ARCHBISHOP Before, and greet his Grace.—My lord, we come. 

<ACTION>All move forward.</ACTION> 

JOHN OF LANCASTER You are well encountered here, my cousin Mowbray.— Good day to you, gentle Lord Archbishop,— And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.—	 My Lord of York, it better showed with you When that your flock, assembled by the bell, Encircled you to hear with reverence Your exposition on the holy text Than now to see you here, an iron man talking,	 Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum, Turning the word to sword, and life to death. That man that sits within a monarch’s heart And ripens in the sunshine of his favor, Would he abuse the countenance of the King,	 Alack, what mischiefs might he set abroach In shadow of such greatness! With you, Lord Bishop, It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken How deep you were within the books of God,	 To us the speaker in His parliament, To us th’ imagined voice of God Himself, The very opener and intelligencer Between the grace, the sanctities, of heaven, And our dull workings? O, who shall believe	 But you misuse the reverence of your place, Employ the countenance and grace of heaven As a false favorite doth his prince’s name, In deeds dishonorable? 

You have ta’en up, Under the counterfeited zeal of God,	 The subjects of His substitute, my father, And both against the peace of heaven and him Have here up-swarmed them.

ARCHBISHOP Good my Lord of Lancaster,	 I am not here against your father’s peace, But, as I told my Lord of Westmoreland, The time misordered doth, in common sense, Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form To hold our safety up. I sent your Grace	 The parcels and particulars of our grief, The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court, Whereon this Hydra son of war is born, Whose dangerous eyes may well be charmed asleep	 With grant of our most just and right desires, And true obedience, of this madness cured, Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty. 

MOWBRAY If not, we ready are to try our fortunes To the last man.	 

HASTINGS And though we here fall down, We have supplies to second our attempt; If they miscarry, theirs shall second them, And so success of mischief shall be born, And heir from heir shall hold his quarrel up	 Whiles England shall have generation. 

JOHN OF LANCASTER You are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow To sound the bottom of the after-times. 

WESTMORELAND Pleaseth your Grace to answer them directly How far forth you do like their articles.	 

JOHN OF LANCASTER I like them all, and do allow them well, And swear here by the honor of my blood My father’s purposes have been mistook, And some about him have too lavishly Wrested his meaning and authority.	 To the Archbishop. My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redressed; Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you, Discharge your powers unto their several counties, As we will ours, and here, between the armies,	 Let’s drink together friendly and embrace, That all their eyes may bear those tokens home Of our restorèd love and amity. 

ARCHBISHOP I take your princely word for these redresses. 

JOHN OF LANCASTER I give it you, and will maintain my word,	 And thereupon I drink unto your Grace. The Leaders of both armies begin to drink together. 

HASTINGS, <ACTION>to an Officer</ACTION> Go, captain, and deliver to the army This news of peace. Let them have pay, and part. I know it will well please them. Hie thee, captain. 

<ACTION>Officer exits.</ACTION> 

ARCHBISHOP ,  <ACTION>toasting Westmoreland</ACTION> To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.	 

WESTMORELAND ,  <ACTION>returning the toast</ACTION> I pledge your Grace, and if you knew what pains I have bestowed to breed this present peace, You would drink freely. But my love to you Shall show itself more openly hereafter. 

ARCHBISHOP I do not doubt you. 

WESTMORELAND  I am glad of it.— Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray. 

MOWBRAY You wish me health in very happy season, For I am on the sudden something ill. 

ARCHBISHOP Against ill chances men are ever merry,	 But heaviness foreruns the good event. 

WESTMORELAND Therefore be merry, coz, since sudden sorrow Serves to say thus: “Some good thing comes tomorrow.” 

ARCHBISHOP Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.	 

MOWBRAY So much the worse if your own rule be true. 

<ACTION>Shout within.</ACTION> 

JOHN OF LANCASTER The word of peace is rendered. Hark how they shout. 

MOWBRAY This had been cheerful after victory. 

ARCHBISHOP A peace is of the nature of a conquest,	 For then both parties nobly are subdued, And neither party loser. 

JOHN OF LANCASTER ,  <ACTION>to Westmoreland </ACTION> Go, my lord, And let our army be dischargèd too. 

<ACTION>Westmoreland exits.</ACTION> 

To the Archbishop. And, good my lord, so please	 you, let our trains March by us, that we may peruse the men We should have coped withal. 

ARCHBISHOP   Go, good Lord Hastings,	 And ere they be dismissed, let them march by. 

<ACTION>Hastings exits.</ACTION> 

JOHN OF LANCASTER I trust, lords, we shall lie tonight together. 

<ACTION>Enter Westmoreland.</ACTION> 

Now, cousin, wherefore stands our army still? 

WESTMORELAND The leaders, having charge from you to stand, Will not go off until they hear you speak.	 

JOHN OF LANCASTER They know their duties. 

<ACTION>Enter Hastings.</ACTION> 

HASTINGS ,  <ACTION>to the Archbishop</ACTION> My lord, our army is dispersed already. Like youthful steers unyoked, they take their courses East, west, north, south, or, like a school broke up,	 Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place. 

WESTMORELAND Good tidings, my Lord Hastings, for the which I do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason.— And you, Lord Archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray, Of capital treason I attach you both.	 

MOWBRAY Is this proceeding just and honorable? 

WESTMORELAND Is your assembly so? 

ARCHBISHOP Will you thus break your faith? 

JOHN OF LANCASTER I pawned thee none. I promised you redress of these same grievances	 Whereof you did complain, which, by mine honor, I will perform with a most Christian care. But for you rebels, look to taste the due Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours. Most shallowly did you these arms commence,	 Fondly brought here, and foolishly sent hence.— Strike up our drums; pursue the scattered stray. God, and not we, hath safely fought today.— Some guard these traitors to the block of death, Treason’s true bed and yielder-up of breath.	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
