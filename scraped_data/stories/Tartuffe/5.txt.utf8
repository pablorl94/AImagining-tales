ORGON, MARIANE 

ORGON Now, Mariane. 

MARIANE Yes, father? 

ORGON Come; I'll tell you A secret. 

MARIANE Yes ... What are you looking for? 

ORGON (looking into a small closet-room) To see there's no one there to spy upon us; That little closet's mighty fit to hide in. There! We're all right now. Mariane, in you I've always found a daughter dutiful And gentle. So I've always love you dearly. 

MARIANE I'm grateful for your fatherly affection. 

ORGON Well spoken, daughter. Now, prove you deserve it By doing as I wish in all respects. 

MARIANE To do so is the height of my ambition. 

ORGON Excellent well. What say you of--Tartuffe? 

MARIANE Who? I? 

ORGON Yes, you. Look to it how you answer. 

MARIANE Why! I'll say of him--anything you please.
