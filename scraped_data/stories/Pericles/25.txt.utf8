GOWER Now our sands are almost run, More a little, and then dumb. This my last boon give me— For such kindness must relieve me— That you aptly will suppose	 What pageantry, what feats, what shows, What minstrelsy and pretty din The regent made in Mytilene To greet the King. So he thrived That he is promised to be wived To fair Marina, but in no wise Till he had done his sacrifice As Dian bade, whereto being bound, The interim, pray you, all confound. In feathered briefness sails are filled,	 And wishes fall out as they’re willed. At Ephesus the temple see Our king and all his company. That he can hither come so soon Is by your fancies’ thankful doom.
