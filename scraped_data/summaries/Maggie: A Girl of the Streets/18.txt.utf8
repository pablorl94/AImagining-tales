Mary's sitting monk-like and having a meal, when in comes Jimmie to very unceremoniously report that Maggie is dead.

Mary—way too late—begins to express a little love for her daughter. It's hard not to want to slap her. She makes a spectacle of herself, wailing and carrying on while neighbors attempt to console her; Miss Smith repeatedly assures her that God will judge Mary for her sins. Phew?

Mary decides she'll forgive Maggie, moaning "I'll fergive her! I'll fergive her!" (19.28).
