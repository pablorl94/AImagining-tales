EGLAMOUR This is the hour that Madam Sylvia Entreated me to call and know her mind; There’s some great matter she’d employ me in. Madam, madam! 

<ACTION>Enter Sylvia, above.</ACTION> 

SYLVIA Who calls?	 

EGLAMOUR Your servant, and your friend, One that attends your Ladyship’s command. 

SYLVIA Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow. 

EGLAMOUR As many, worthy lady, to yourself. According to your Ladyship’s impose,	 I am thus early come to know what service It is your pleasure to command me in. 

SYLVIA O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman— Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not— Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplished.	 Thou art not ignorant what dear good will I bear unto the banished Valentine, Nor how my father would enforce me marry Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhorred. Thyself hast loved, and I have heard thee say	 No grief did ever come so near thy heart As when thy lady and thy true love died, Upon whose grave thou vow’dst pure chastity. Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine, To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode;	 And for the ways are dangerous to pass, I do desire thy worthy company, Upon whose faith and honor I repose. Urge not my father’s anger, Eglamour, But think upon my grief, a lady’s grief,	 And on the justice of my flying hence To keep me from a most unholy match, Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues. I do desire thee, even from a heart As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,	 To bear me company and go with me; If not, to hide what I have said to thee, That I may venture to depart alone. 

EGLAMOUR Madam, I pity much your grievances, Which, since I know they virtuously are placed,	 I give consent to go along with you, Recking as little what betideth me As much I wish all good befortune you. When will you go? 

SYLVIA This evening coming.	 

EGLAMOUR Where shall I meet you? 

SYLVIA At Friar Patrick’s cell, Where I intend holy confession. 

EGLAMOUR I will not fail your Ladyship. Good morrow, gentle lady.	 

SYLVIA Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.
