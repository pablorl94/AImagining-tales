<ACTION>Enter Lafew and Bertram.</ACTION> 

LAFEW But I hope your Lordship thinks not him a soldier. 

BERTRAM Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof. 

LAFEW You have it from his own deliverance. 

BERTRAM And by other warranted testimony.	 

LAFEW Then my dial goes not true. I took this lark for a bunting. 

BERTRAM I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge and accordingly valiant. 

LAFEW I have then sinned against his experience and	 transgressed against his valor, and my state that way is dangerous since I cannot yet find in my heart to repent. Here he comes. I pray you make us friends. I will pursue the amity. 

<ACTION>Enter Parolles.</ACTION> 

PAROLLES , <ACTION> to Bertram </ACTION> These things shall be done, sir.	 

LAFEW ,  <ACTION>to Bertram </ACTION> Pray you, sir, who’s his tailor? 

PAROLLES Sir? 

LAFEW O, I know him well. Ay, sir, he, sir, ’s a good workman, a very good tailor. 

BERTRAM ,  <ACTION>aside to Parolles</ACTION> Is she gone to the King?	 

PAROLLES She is. 

BERTRAM Will she away tonight? 

PAROLLES  As you’ll have her. 

BERTRAM I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure, Given order for our horses, and tonight,	 When I should take possession of the bride, End ere I do begin. 

LAFEW ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> A good traveler is something at the latter end of a dinner, but one that lies three thirds, and uses a known truth to pass a thousand nothings	 with, should be once heard and thrice beaten.— God save you, captain. 

BERTRAM ,  <ACTION>to Parolles </ACTION> Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur? 

PAROLLES I know not how I have deserved to run into	 my lord’s displeasure. 

LAFEW  You have made shift to run into ’t, boots and spurs and all, like him that leapt into the custard; and out of it you’ll run again rather than suffer question for your residence.	 

BERTRAM It may be you have mistaken him, my lord. 

LAFEW And shall do so ever, though I took him at ’s prayers. Fare you well, my lord, and believe this of me: there can be no kernel in this light nut. The soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in	 matter of heavy consequence. I have kept of them tame and know their natures.—Farewell, monsieur. I have spoken better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand, but we must do good against evil.	 

<ACTION>He exits. </ACTION> 

PAROLLES  An idle lord, I swear. 

BERTRAM I think not so. 

PAROLLES Why, do you not know him? 

BERTRAM Yes, I do know him well, and common speech Gives him a worthy pass.	 

<ACTION>Enter Helen.</ACTION> 

Here comes my clog. 

HELEN I have, sir, as I was commanded from you, Spoke with the King and have procured his leave For present parting. Only he desires Some private speech with you.	 

BERTRAM I shall obey his will. You must not marvel, Helen, at my course, Which holds not color with the time, nor does The ministration and requirèd office On my particular. Prepared I was not	 For such a business; therefore am I found So much unsettled. This drives me to entreat you That presently you take your way for home, And rather muse than ask why I entreat you; For my respects are better than they seem,	 And my appointments have in them a need Greater than shows itself at the first view To you that know them not.	 <ACTION>Giving her a paper.</ACTION> This to my mother. ’Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so	 I leave you to your wisdom. 

HELEN Sir, I can nothing say But that I am your most obedient servant— 

BERTRAM Come, come, no more of that. 

HELEN And ever shall	 With true observance seek to eke out that Wherein toward me my homely stars have failed To equal my great fortune. 

BERTRAM Let that go. My haste is very great. Farewell. Hie home.	 

HELEN Pray, sir, your pardon. 

BERTRAM Well, what would you say? 

HELEN I am not worthy of the wealth I owe, Nor dare I say ’tis mine—and yet it is— But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal	 What law does vouch mine own. 

BERTRAM  What would you have? 

HELEN Something, and scarce so much; nothing, indeed. I would not tell you what I would, my lord. Faith, yes:		 Strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss. 

BERTRAM I pray you stay not, but in haste to horse. 

HELEN I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.— Where are my other men?—Monsieur, farewell. 

<ACTION>She exits.</ACTION> 

BERTRAM Go thou toward home, where I will never come	 Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.— Away, and for our flight. 

PAROLLES  Bravely, coraggio! 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
