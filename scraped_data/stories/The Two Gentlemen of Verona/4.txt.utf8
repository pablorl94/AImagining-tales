JULIA And seal the bargain with a holy kiss. 

PROTEUS Here is my hand for my true constancy. And when that hour o’erslips me in the day Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,	 The next ensuing hour some foul mischance Torment me for my love’s forgetfulness. My father stays my coming. Answer not. The tide is now—nay, not thy tide of tears; That tide will stay me longer than I should.	 Julia, farewell.
