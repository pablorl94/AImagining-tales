<ACTION>Enter a Second Merchant, Angelo the Goldsmith,and an Officer.</ACTION> 

SECOND MERCHANT ,  <ACTION>to Angelo</ACTION> You know since Pentecost the sum is due, And since I have not much importuned you, Nor now I had not, but that I am bound To Persia and want guilders for my voyage. Therefore make present satisfaction,	 Or I’ll attach you by this officer. 

ANGELO Even just the sum that I do owe to you Is growing to me by Antipholus. And in the instant that I met with you, He had of me a chain. At five o’clock	 I shall receive the money for the same. Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house, I will discharge my bond and thank you too. 

<ACTION>Enter Antipholus of Ephesus and Dromio ofEphesus from the Courtesan’s.</ACTION> 

OFFICER That labor may you save. See where he comes. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS ,  <ACTION>to Dromio of Ephesus</ACTION> While I go to the goldsmith’s house, go thou	 And buy a rope’s end. That will I bestow Among my wife and her confederates For locking me out of my doors by day. But soft. I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone. Buy thou a rope, and bring it home to me.	 

DROMIO OF EPHESUS I buy a thousand pound a year! I buy a rope! 

<ACTION>Dromio exits.</ACTION> 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS ,  <ACTION>to Angelo</ACTION> A man is well holp up that trusts to you! I promisèd your presence and the chain, But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me. Belike you thought our love would last too long	 If it were chained together, and therefore came not. 

ANGELO , <ACTION> handing a paper to Antipholus of Ephesus</ACTION> Saving your merry humor, here’s the note How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat, The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion, Which doth amount to three-odd ducats more	 Than I stand debted to this gentleman. I pray you, see him presently discharged, For he is bound to sea, and stays but for it. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I am not furnished with the present money. Besides, I have some business in the town.	 Good signior, take the stranger to my house, And with you take the chain, and bid my wife Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof. Perchance I will be there as soon as you. 

ANGELO Then you will bring the chain to her yourself.	 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS No, bear it with you lest I come not time enough. 

ANGELO Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you? 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS An if I have not, sir, I hope you have, Or else you may return without your money. 

ANGELO Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain.	 Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman, And I, to blame, have held him here too long. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Good Lord! You use this dalliance to excuse Your breach of promise to the Porpentine. I should have chid you for not bringing it,	 But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl. 

SECOND MERCHANT , <ACTION> to Angelo</ACTION> The hour steals on. I pray you, sir, dispatch. 

ANGELO , <ACTION> to Antipholus of Ephesus</ACTION> You hear how he importunes me. The chain! 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money. 

ANGELO Come, come. You know I gave it you even now.	 Either send the chain, or send by me some token. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Fie, now you run this humor out of breath. Come, where’s the chain? I pray you, let me see it. 

SECOND MERCHANT My business cannot brook this dalliance. Good sir, say whe’er you’ll answer me or no.	 If not, I’ll leave him to the Officer. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I answer you? What should I answer you? 

ANGELO The money that you owe me for the chain. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I owe you none till I receive the chain. 

ANGELO You know I gave it you half an hour since.	 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS You gave me none. You wrong me much to say so. 

ANGELO You wrong me more, sir, in denying it. Consider how it stands upon my credit. 

SECOND MERCHANT Well, officer, arrest him at my suit. 

OFFICER ,  <ACTION>to Angelo</ACTION> I do, and charge you in the Duke’s name to obey	 me. 

ANGELO , <ACTION> to Antipholus of Ephesus</ACTION> This touches me in reputation. Either consent to pay this sum for me, Or I attach you by this officer. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Consent to pay thee that I never had?—	 Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar’st. 

ANGELO ,  <ACTION>to Officer</ACTION> Here is thy fee. Arrest him, officer.	Giving money. I would not spare my brother in this case If he should scorn me so apparently. 

OFFICER ,  <ACTION>to Antipholus of Ephesus</ACTION> I do arrest you, sir. You hear the suit.	 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I do obey thee till I give thee bail. <ACTION>To Angelo.</ACTION> But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear As all the metal in your shop will answer. 

ANGELO Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,	 To your notorious shame, I doubt it not. 

<ACTION>Enter Dromio of Syracuse from the bay.</ACTION> 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Master, there’s a bark of Epidamium That stays but till her owner comes aboard, And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir, I have conveyed aboard, and I have bought	 The oil, the balsamum, and aqua vitae. The ship is in her trim; the merry wind Blows fair from land. They stay for naught at all But for their owner, master, and yourself. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS How now? A madman? Why, thou peevish sheep,	 What ship of Epidamium stays for me? 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope And told thee to what purpose and what end. 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE You sent me for a rope’s end as soon.	 You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark. 

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I will debate this matter at more leisure And teach your ears to list me with more heed. To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight. <ACTION>He gives a key.</ACTION> Give her this key, and tell her in the desk	 That’s covered o’er with Turkish tapestry There is a purse of ducats. Let her send it. Tell her I am arrested in the street, And that shall bail me. Hie thee, slave. Begone.— On, officer, to prison till it come.	 

<ACTION>All but Dromio of Syracuse exit.</ACTION> 

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE To Adriana. That is where we dined, Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband. She is too big, I hope, for me to compass. Thither I must, although against my will, For servants must their masters’ minds fulfill.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
