<ACTION>Enter aloft Christopher Sly, the drunkard, withAttendants, some with apparel, basin and ewer, andother appurtenances, and Lord dressed as an Attendant.</ACTION> 

SLY For God’s sake, a pot of small ale. 

FIRST SERVINGMAN Will ’t please your Lord drink a cup of sack? 

SECOND SERVINGMAN Will ’t please your Honor taste of these conserves? 

THIRD SERVINGMAN What raiment will your Honor wear today? 

SLY I am Christophero Sly! Call not me “Honor” nor	 “Lordship.” I ne’er drank sack in my life. An if you give me any conserves, give me conserves of beef. Ne’er ask me what raiment I’ll wear, for I have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings than legs, nor no more shoes than feet, nay sometime	 more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my toes look through the over-leather. 

LORD , <ACTION> as Attendant</ACTION> Heaven cease this idle humor in your Honor! O, that a mighty man of such descent, Of such possessions, and so high esteem	 Should be infusèd with so foul a spirit! 

SLY What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher Sly, old Sly’s son of Burton Heath, by birth a peddler, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a bearherd, and now by present profession a	 tinker? Ask Marian Hacket, the fat alewife of Wincot, if she know me not! If she say I am not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the lying’st knave in Christendom. What, I am not bestraught! Here’s—	 

THIRD SERVINGMAN O, this it is that makes your lady mourn. 

SECOND SERVINGMAN O, this is it that makes your servants droop. 

LORD ,  <ACTION>as Attendant</ACTION> Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house, As beaten hence by your strange lunacy. O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,	 Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment, And banish hence these abject lowly dreams. Look how thy servants do attend on thee, Each in his office ready at thy beck. Wilt thou have music? Hark, Apollo plays,	Music.   And twenty cagèd nightingales do sing. Or wilt thou sleep? We’ll have thee to a couch Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed On purpose trimmed up for Semiramis. Say thou wilt walk, we will bestrew the ground.	 Or wilt thou ride? Thy horses shall be trapped, Their harness studded all with gold and pearl. Dost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks will soar Above the morning lark. Or wilt thou hunt? Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them	 And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth. 

FIRST SERVINGMAN Say thou wilt course. Thy greyhounds are as swift As breathèd stags, ay, fleeter than the roe. 

SECOND SERVINGMAN Dost thou love pictures? We will fetch thee straight Adonis painted by a running brook,	 And Cytherea all in sedges hid, Which seem to move and wanton with her breath, Even as the waving sedges play with wind. 

LORD ,  <ACTION>as Attendant</ACTION> We’ll show thee Io as she was a maid And how she was beguilèd and surprised,	 As lively painted as the deed was done. 

THIRD SERVINGMAN Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood, Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds, And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep, So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.	 

LORD ,  <ACTION>as Attendant</ACTION> Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord; Thou hast a lady far more beautiful Than any woman in this waning age. 

FIRST SERVINGMAN And till the tears that she hath shed for thee Like envious floods o’errun her lovely face,	 She was the fairest creature in the world— And yet she is inferior to none. 

SLY Am I a lord, and have I such a lady? Or do I dream? Or have I dreamed till now? I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak,	 I smell sweet savors, and I feel soft things. Upon my life, I am a lord indeed And not a tinker, nor Christopher Sly. Well, bring our lady hither to our sight, And once again a pot o’ the smallest ale.	 

SECOND SERVINGMAN Will ’t please your Mightiness to wash your hands? O, how we joy to see your wit restored! O, that once more you knew but what you are! These fifteen years you have been in a dream, Or, when you waked, so waked as if you slept.	 

SLY These fifteen years! By my fay, a goodly nap. But did I never speak of all that time? 

FIRST SERVINGMAN Oh, yes, my lord, but very idle words. For though you lay here in this goodly chamber, Yet would you say you were beaten out of door,	 And rail upon the hostess of the house, And say you would present her at the leet Because she brought stone jugs and no sealed quarts. Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.	 

SLY Ay, the woman’s maid of the house. 

THIRD SERVINGMAN Why, sir, you know no house, nor no such maid, Nor no such men as you have reckoned up, As Stephen Sly and old John Naps of Greete, And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell,	 And twenty more such names and men as these, Which never were, nor no man ever saw. 

SLY Now, Lord be thanked for my good amends! 

ALL Amen. 

SLY I thank thee. Thou shalt not lose by it.	 

<ACTION>Enter Page as Lady, with Attendants.</ACTION> 

PAGE , <ACTION> as Lady</ACTION> How fares my noble lord? 

SLY Marry, I fare well, for here is cheer enough. Where is my wife? 

PAGE ,  <ACTION>as Lady</ACTION> Here, noble lord. What is thy will with her? 

SLY Are you my wife, and will not call me “husband”?	 My men should call me “lord.” I am your goodman. 

PAGE , <ACTION> as Lady</ACTION> My husband and my lord, my lord and husband, I am your wife in all obedience. 

SLY I know it well.—What must I call her? 

LORD ,  <ACTION>as Attendant</ACTION> “Madam.”	 

SLY  “Alice Madam,” or “Joan Madam”? 

LORD “Madam,” and nothing else. So lords call ladies. 

SLY Madam wife, they say that I have dreamed And slept above some fifteen year or more. 

PAGE ,  <ACTION>as Lady</ACTION> Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,	 Being all this time abandoned from your bed. 

SLY ’Tis much.—Servants, leave me and her alone.— Madam, undress you, and come now to bed. 

PAGE ,  <ACTION>as Lady</ACTION> Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you To pardon me yet for a night or two;	 Or if not so, until the sun be set. For your physicians have expressly charged, In peril to incur your former malady, That I should yet absent me from your bed. I hope this reason stands for my excuse. 

SLY  Ay, it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long; but I would be loath to fall into my dreams again. I will therefore tarry in despite of the flesh and the blood. 

<ACTION>Enter a Messenger.</ACTION> 

MESSENGER Your Honor’s players, hearing your amendment,	 Are come to play a pleasant comedy, For so your doctors hold it very meet, Seeing too much sadness hath congealed your blood, And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy.	 Therefore they thought it good you hear a play And frame your mind to mirth and merriment, Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life. 

SLY  Marry, I will. Let them play it.	 

<ACTION>Messenger exits.</ACTION> 

Is not a comonty a Christmas gambold or a tumbling	 trick? 

PAGE ,  <ACTION>as Lady</ACTION> No, my good lord, it is more pleasing stuff. 

SLY  What, household stuff? 

PAGE ,  <ACTION>as Lady</ACTION> It is a kind of history. 

SLY Well, we’ll see ’t. Come, madam wife, sit by my	 side, and let the world slip. We shall ne’er be younger. 

<ACTION>They sit.</ACTION>
