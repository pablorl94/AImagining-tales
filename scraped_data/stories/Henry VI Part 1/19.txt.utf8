CHARLES These news, my lords, may cheer our drooping spirits: â€™Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt And turn again unto the warlike French. 

ALANSON Then march to Paris, royal Charles of France, And keep not back your powers in dalliance. 

PUCELLE Peace be amongst them if they turn to us; Else ruin combat with their palaces! 

<ACTION>Enter Scout.</ACTION> 

SCOUT Success unto our valiant general, And happiness to his accomplices. 

CHARLES What tidings send our scouts? I prithee speak.	 

SCOUT The English army that divided was Into two parties is now conjoined in one, And means to give you battle presently. 

CHARLES Somewhat too sudden, sirs, the warning is, But we will presently provide for them.	 

BURGUNDY I trust the ghost of Talbot is not there. Now he is gone, my lord, you need not fear. 

PUCELLE Of all base passions, fear is most accursed. Command the conquest, Charles, it shall be thine; Let Henry fret and all the world repine.	 

CHARLES Then on, my lords, and France be fortunate! 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
