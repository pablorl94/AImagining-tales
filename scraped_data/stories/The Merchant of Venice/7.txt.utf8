<ACTION>Enter Shylock, the Jew, and Lancelet,his man that was, the Clown.</ACTION> 

SHYLOCK Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge, The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.— What, Jessica!—Thou shalt not gormandize As thou hast done with me—what, Jessica!— And sleep, and snore, and rend apparel out.—	 Why, Jessica, I say! 

LANCELET Why, Jessica! 

SHYLOCK Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call. 

LANCELET Your Worship was wont to tell me I could do nothing without bidding.	 

<ACTION>Enter Jessica.</ACTION> 

JESSICA Call you? What is your will? 

SHYLOCK I am bid forth to supper, Jessica. There are my keys.—But wherefore should I go? I am not bid for love. They flatter me. But yet I’ll go in hate, to feed upon	 The prodigal Christian.—Jessica, my girl, Look to my house.—I am right loath to go. There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest, For I did dream of money bags tonight. 

LANCELET  I beseech you, sir, go. My young master	 doth expect your reproach. 

SHYLOCK So do I his. 

LANCELET  And they have conspired together—I will not say you shall see a masque, but if you do, then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on	 Black Monday last, at six o’clock i’ th’ morning, falling out that year on Ash Wednesday was four year in th’ afternoon. 

SHYLOCK What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica, Lock up my doors, and when you hear the drum	 And the vile squealing of the wry-necked fife, Clamber not you up to the casements then, Nor thrust your head into the public street To gaze on Christian fools with varnished faces, But stop my house’s ears (I mean my casements).	 Let not the sound of shallow fopp’ry enter My sober house. By Jacob’s staff I swear I have no mind of feasting forth tonight. But I will go.—Go you before me, sirrah. Say I will come.	 

LANCELET I will go before, sir.  <ACTION>Aside to Jessica.</ACTION> Mistress, look out at window for all this. There will come a Christian by Will be worth a Jewess’ eye.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

SHYLOCK What says that fool of Hagar’s offspring, ha?	 

JESSICA His words were “Farewell, mistress,” nothing else. 

SHYLOCK The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder, Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day More than the wildcat. Drones hive not with me, Therefore I part with him, and part with him	 To one that I would have him help to waste His borrowed purse. Well, Jessica, go in. Perhaps I will return immediately. Do as I bid you. Shut doors after you. Fast bind, fast find—	 A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

JESSICA Farewell, and if my fortune be not crossed, I have a father, you a daughter, lost. 

<ACTION>She exits.</ACTION>
