KING EDWARD Once more we sit in England’s royal throne, Repurchased with the blood of enemies. What valiant foemen, like to autumn’s corn, Have we mowed down in tops of all their pride! Three dukes of Somerset, threefold renowned For hardy and undoubted champions; Two Cliffords, as the father and the son; And two Northumberlands; two braver men Ne’er spurred their coursers at the trumpet’s sound. With them the two brave bears, Warwick and	 Montague, That in their chains fettered the kingly lion And made the forest tremble when they roared. Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat And made our footstool of security.—	 Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.— Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself Have in our armors watched the winter’s night, Went all afoot in summer’s scalding heat, That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace,	 And of our labors thou shalt reap the gain. 

RICHARD ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> I’ll blast his harvest, if your head were laid; For yet I am not looked on in the world. This shoulder was ordained so thick to heave, And heave it shall some weight or break my back.	 Work thou the way and that shalt execute. 

KING EDWARD Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen, And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both. 

CLARENCE The duty that I owe unto your Majesty I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.	 

<ACTION>He kisses the infant.</ACTION> 

KING EDWARD Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks. 

RICHARD And that I love the tree from whence thou sprang’st, Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit. 

<ACTION>He kisses the infant.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Aside. </ACTION> To say the truth, so Judas kissed his master And cried “All hail!” whenas he meant all harm.	 

KING EDWARD Now am I seated as my soul delights, Having my country’s peace and brothers’ loves. 

CLARENCE What will your Grace have done with Margaret? Reignier, her father, to the King of France Hath pawned the Sicils and Jerusalem,	 And hither have they sent it for her ransom. 

KING EDWARD Away with her, and waft her hence to France. And now what rests but that we spend the time With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows, Such as befits the pleasure of the court?	 Sound drums and trumpets! Farewell, sour annoy, For here I hope begins our lasting joy. 

<ACTION>Flourish. They all exit.</ACTION>
