CANTO VIII 

The world was in its day of peril dark Wont to believe the dotage of fond love From the fair Cyprian deity, who rolls In her third epicycle, shed on men By stream of potent radiance: therefore they Of elder time, in their old error blind, Not her alone with sacrifice ador'd And invocation, but like honours paid To Cupid and Dione, deem'd of them Her mother, and her son, him whom they feign'd To sit in Dido's bosom: and from her, Whom I have sung preluding, borrow'd they The appellation of that star, which views, Now obvious and now averse, the sun. 

I was not ware that I was wafted up Into  its orb; but the new loveliness That grac'd my lady, gave me ample proof That we had entered there.  And as in flame A sparkle is distinct, or voice in voice Discern'd, when one its even tenour keeps, The other comes and goes; so in that light I other luminaries saw, that cours'd In circling motion, rapid more or less, As their eternal phases each impels. 

Never was blast from vapour charged with cold, Whether invisible to eye or no, Descended with such speed, it had not seem'd To linger in dull tardiness, compar'd To those celestial lights, that tow'rds us came, Leaving the circuit of their joyous ring, Conducted by the lofty seraphim. And after them, who in the van appear'd, Such an hosanna sounded, as hath left Desire, ne'er since extinct in me, to hear Renew'd the strain.  Then parting from the rest One near us drew, and sole began: "We all Are ready at thy pleasure, well dispos'd To do thee gentle service.  We are they, To whom thou in the world erewhile didst Sing 'O ye! whose intellectual ministry Moves the third heaven!' and in one orb we roll, One motion, one impulse, with those who rule Princedoms in heaven; yet are of love so full, That to please thee 't will be as sweet to rest." 

After mine eyes had with meek reverence Sought the celestial guide, and were by her Assur'd, they turn'd again unto the light Who had so largely promis'd, and with voice That bare the lively pressure of my zeal, "Tell who ye are," I cried.  Forthwith it grew In size and splendour, through augmented joy; And thus it answer'd: "A short date below The world possess'd me.  Had the time been more, Much evil, that will come, had never chanc'd. My gladness hides thee from me, which doth shine Around, and shroud me, as an animal In its own silk unswath'd.  Thou lov'dst me well, And had'st good cause; for had my sojourning Been longer on the earth, the love I bare thee Had put forth more than blossoms.  The left bank, That Rhone, when he hath mix'd with Sorga, laves. 

"In me its lord expected, and that horn Of fair Ausonia, with its boroughs old, Bari, and Croton, and Gaeta pil'd, From where the Trento disembogues his waves, With Verde mingled, to the salt sea-flood. Already on my temples beam'd the crown, Which gave me sov'reignty over the land By Danube wash'd, whenas he strays beyond The limits of his German shores. The realm, Where, on the gulf by stormy Eurus lash'd, Betwixt Pelorus and Pachynian heights, The beautiful Trinacria lies in gloom (Not through Typhaeus, but the vap'ry cloud Bituminous upsteam'd), THAT too did look To have its scepter wielded by a race Of monarchs, sprung through me from Charles and Rodolph; had not ill lording which doth spirit up The people ever, in Palermo rais'd The shout of 'death,' re-echo'd loud and long. Had but my brother's foresight kenn'd as much, He had been warier that the greedy want Of Catalonia might not work his bale. And truly need there is, that he forecast, Or other for him, lest more freight be laid On his already over-laden bark. 

Nature in him, from bounty fall'n to thrift, Would ask the  guard of braver arms, than such As only care to have their coffers fill'd."

"My liege, it doth enhance the joy thy words Infuse into me, mighty as it is, To think my gladness manifest to thee, As to myself, who own it, when thou lookst Into the source and limit of all good, There, where thou markest that which thou dost speak, Thence priz'd of me the more.  Glad thou hast made me. Now make intelligent, clearing the doubt Thy speech hath raised in me; for much I muse, How bitter can spring up, when sweet is sown." 

I thus inquiring; he forthwith replied: "If I have power to show one truth, soon that Shall face thee, which thy questioning declares Behind thee now conceal'd.  The Good, that guides And blessed makes this realm, which thou dost mount, Ordains its providence to be the virtue In these great bodies: nor th' all perfect Mind Upholds their nature merely, but in them Their energy to save: for nought, that lies Within the range of that unerring bow, But is as level with the destin'd aim, As ever mark to arrow's point oppos'd. Were it not thus, these heavens, thou dost visit, Would their effect so work, it would not be Art, but destruction; and this may not chance, If th' intellectual powers, that move these stars, Fail not, or who, first faulty made them fail. Wilt thou this truth more clearly evidenc'd?" 

To whom I thus: "It is enough: no fear, I see, lest nature in her part should tire." 

He straight rejoin'd: "Say, were it worse for man, If he liv'd not in fellowship on earth?" 

"Yea," answer'd I; "nor here a reason needs." 

"And may that be, if different estates Grow not of different duties in your life? Consult your teacher, and he tells you 'no."' 

Thus did he come, deducing to this point, And then concluded: "For this cause behooves, The roots, from whence your operations come, Must differ. Therefore one is Solon born; Another, Xerxes; and Melchisidec A third; and he a fourth, whose airy voyage Cost him his son. In her circuitous course, Nature, that is the seal to mortal wax, Doth well her art, but no distinctions owns 'Twixt one or other household. Hence befalls That Esau is so wide of Jacob: hence Quirinus of so base a father springs, He dates from Mars his lineage. Were it not That providence celestial overrul'd, Nature, in generation, must the path Trac'd by the generator, still pursue Unswervingly. Thus place I in thy sight That, which was late behind thee. But, in sign Of more affection for thee, 't is my will Thou wear this corollary. Nature ever Finding discordant fortune, like all seed Out of its proper climate, thrives but ill. And were the world below content to mark And work on the foundation nature lays, It would not lack supply of excellence. 

But ye perversely to religion strain Him, who was born to gird on him the sword, And of the fluent phrasemen make your king; Therefore your steps have wander'd from the paths."
