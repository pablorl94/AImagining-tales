SCENE VI.--VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES. 

VAL. (_laughing_). Well, Master Jacques, your frankness is badly rewarded, I fear. 

JAC. S'death! Mr. Upstart, you who assume the man of consequence, it is no business of yours as far as I can see. Laugh at your own cudgelling when you get it, and don't come here and laugh at mine. 

VAL. Ah! Master Jacques, don't get into a passion, I beg of you. 

JAC. (_aside_). He is drawing in his horns. I will put on a bold face, and if he is fool enough to be afraid of me, I will pay him back somewhat. (_To_ VALÈRE) Do you know, Mr. Grinner, that I am not exactly in a laughing humour, and that if you provoke me too much, I shall make you laugh after another fashion. (JACQUES _pushes_ VALÈRE _to the farther end of the stage, threatening him_.) 

VAL. Gently, gently. 

JAC. How gently? And if it does not please me to go gently? 

VAL. Come, come! What are you about? 

JAC. You are an impudent rascal. 

VAL. Master Jacques.... 

JAC. None of your Master Jacques here! If I take up a stick, I shall soon make you feel it. 

VAL. What do you mean by a stick? (_Drives back_ JACQUES _in his turn_.) 

JAC. No; I don't say anything about that. 

VAL. Do you know, Mr. Conceit, that I am a man to give you a drubbing in good earnest? 

JAC. I have no doubt of it. 

VAL. That, after all, you are nothing but a scrub of a cook? 

JAC. I know it very well. 

VAL. And that you don't know me yet? 

JAC. I beg your pardon. 

VAL. You will beat me, you say? 

JAC. I only spoke in jest. 

VAL. I don't like your jesting, and (_beating_ JACQUES) remember that you are but a sorry hand at it. 

JAC. (_alone_). Plague take all sincerity; it is a bad trade. I give it up for the future, and will cease to tell the truth. It is all very well for my master to beat me; but as for that Mr. Steward, what right has he to do it? I will be revenged on him if I can.
