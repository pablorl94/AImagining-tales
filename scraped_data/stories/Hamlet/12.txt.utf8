<ACTION>Enter Hamlet.</ACTION> 

HAMLET  Safely stowed. 

GENTLEMEN ,  <ACTION>within </ACTION> Hamlet! Lord Hamlet! 

HAMLET But soft, what noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come. 

<ACTION>Enter Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and others.</ACTION> 

ROSENCRANTZ What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?	 

HAMLET Compounded it with dust, whereto ’tis kin. 

ROSENCRANTZ Tell us where ’tis, that we may take it thence And bear it to the chapel. 

HAMLET Do not believe it. 

ROSENCRANTZ Believe what?	 

HAMLET That I can keep your counsel and not mine own. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the son of a king? 

ROSENCRANTZ  Take you me for a sponge, my lord? 

HAMLET  Ay, sir, that soaks up the King’s countenance,	 his rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the King best service in the end. He keeps them like an ape an apple in the corner of his jaw, first mouthed, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you	 shall be dry again. 

ROSENCRANTZ I understand you not, my lord. 

HAMLET I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear. 

ROSENCRANTZ My lord, you must tell us where the	 body is and go with us to the King. 

HAMLET The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body. The King is a thing— 

GUILDENSTERN A “thing,” my lord? 

HAMLET Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and	 all after! 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
