<ACTION>Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.</ACTION> 

HAMLET The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold. 

HORATIO It is a nipping and an eager air. 

HAMLET What hour now? 

HORATIO I think it lacks of twelve. 

MARCELLUS No, it is struck.	 

HORATIO Indeed, I heard it not. It then draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk. <ACTION>A flourish of trumpets and two pieces goes off.</ACTION> What does this mean, my lord? 

HAMLET The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse, Keeps wassail, and the swagg’ring upspring reels;	 And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down, The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge. 

HORATIO Is it a custom? 

HAMLET Ay, marry, is ’t,	 But, to my mind, though I am native here And to the manner born, it is a custom More honored in the breach than the observance. This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traduced and taxed of other nations.	 They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition. And, indeed, it takes From our achievements, though performed at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute.	 So oft it chances in particular men That for some vicious mole of nature in them, As in their birth (wherein they are not guilty, Since nature cannot choose his origin), By the o’ergrowth of some complexion	 (Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason), Or by some habit that too much o’erleavens The form of plausive manners—that these men, Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being nature’s livery or fortune’s star,	 His virtues else, be they as pure as grace, As infinite as man may undergo, Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault. The dram of evil Doth all the noble substance of a doubt	 To his own scandal. 

<ACTION>Enter Ghost.</ACTION> 

HORATIO Look, my lord, it comes. 

HAMLET Angels and ministers of grace, defend us! Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned, Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from	 hell, Be thy intents wicked or charitable, Thou com’st in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee. I’ll call thee “Hamlet,” “King,” “Father,” “Royal Dane.” O, answer me!	 Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell Why thy canonized bones, hearsèd in death, Have burst their cerements; why the sepulcher, Wherein we saw thee quietly interred, Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws	 To cast thee up again. What may this mean That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel, Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous, and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition	 With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? Say, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do? 

<ACTION>Ghost beckons.</ACTION> 

HORATIO It beckons you to go away with it As if it some impartment did desire To you alone.	 

MARCELLUS Look with what courteous action It waves you to a more removèd ground. But do not go with it. 

HORATIO No, by no means. 

HAMLET It will not speak. Then I will follow it.	 

HORATIO Do not, my lord. 

HAMLET  Why, what should be the fear? I do not set my life at a pin’s fee. And for my soul, what can it do to that, Being a thing immortal as itself?	 It waves me forth again. I’ll follow it. 

HORATIO What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord? Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That beetles o’er his base into the sea, And there assume some other horrible form	 Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness? Think of it. The very place puts toys of desperation, Without more motive, into every brain That looks so many fathoms to the sea	 And hears it roar beneath. 

HAMLET It waves me still.—Go on, I’ll follow thee. 

MARCELLUS You shall not go, my lord.	 <ACTION>They hold back Hamlet.</ACTION> 

HAMLET  Hold off your hands. 

HORATIO Be ruled. You shall not go.	 

HAMLET My fate cries out And makes each petty arture in this body As hardy as the Nemean lion’s nerve. Still am I called. Unhand me, gentlemen. By heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me!	 I say, away!—Go on. I’ll follow thee. 

<ACTION>Ghost and Hamlet exit.</ACTION> 

HORATIO He waxes desperate with imagination. 

MARCELLUS Let’s follow. ’Tis not fit thus to obey him. 

HORATIO Have after. To what issue will this come? 

MARCELLUS Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.	 

HORATIO Heaven will direct it. 

MARCELLUS Nay, let’s follow him. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
