<ACTION>Enter Hubert and Executioners, with irons and rope.</ACTION> 

HUBERT Heat me these irons hot, and look thou stand Within the arras. When I strike my foot Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth And bind the boy which you shall find with me Fast to the chair. Be heedful. Hence, and watch.	 

EXECUTIONER I hope your warrant will bear out the deed. 

HUBERT Uncleanly scruples fear not you. Look to ’t. Executioners exit. Young lad, come forth. I have to say with you. 

<ACTION>Enter Arthur.</ACTION> 

ARTHUR Good morrow, Hubert. 

HUBERT  Good morrow, little prince.	 

ARTHUR As little prince, having so great a title To be more prince, as may be. You are sad. 

HUBERT Indeed, I have been merrier. 

ARTHUR  Mercy on me! Methinks nobody should be sad but I.	 Yet I remember, when I was in France, Young gentlemen would be as sad as night Only for wantonness. By my christendom, So I were out of prison and kept sheep, I should be as merry as the day is long.	 And so I would be here but that I doubt My uncle practices more harm to me. He is afraid of me, and I of him. Is it my fault that I was Geoffrey’s son? No, indeed, is ’t not. And I would to heaven	 I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert. 

HUBERT ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> If I talk to him, with his innocent prate He will awake my mercy, which lies dead. Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch. 

ARTHUR Are you sick, Hubert? You look pale today.	 In sooth, I would you were a little sick That I might sit all night and watch with you. I warrant I love you more than you do me. 

HUBERT ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> His words do take possession of my bosom. He shows Arthur a paper. Read here, young Arthur. (Aside.) How now,	 foolish rheum? Turning dispiteous torture out of door? I must be brief lest resolution drop Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.— Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?	 

ARTHUR Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect. Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes? 

HUBERT Young boy, I must. 

ARTHUR  And will you? HUBERT And I will.	 

ARTHUR Have you the heart? When your head did but ache, I knit my handkercher about your brows— The best I had, a princess wrought it me— And I did never ask it you again; And with my hand at midnight held your head,	 And like the watchful minutes to the hour Still and anon cheered up the heavy time, Saying “What lack you?” and “Where lies your grief?” Or “What good love may I perform for you?”	 Many a poor man’s son would have lien still And ne’er have spoke a loving word to you; But you at your sick service had a prince. Nay, you may think my love was crafty love, And call it cunning. Do, an if you will.	 If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill, Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes— These eyes that never did nor never shall So much as frown on you? 

HUBERT I have sworn to do it.	 And with hot irons must I burn them out. 

ARTHUR Ah, none but in this Iron Age would do it. The iron of itself, though heat red-hot, Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears And quench this fiery indignation	 Even in the matter of mine innocence; Nay, after that, consume away in rust But for containing fire to harm mine eye. Are you more stubborn-hard than hammered iron? An if an angel should have come to me	 And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes, I would not have believed him. No tongue but Hubert’s. 

<ACTION>HUBERT stamps his foot and calls  Come forth.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Executioners with ropes, a heated iron, and abrazier of burning coals.</ACTION> 

Do as I bid you do.	 

ARTHUR O, save me, Hubert, save me! My eyes are out Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men. 

HUBERT Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here. He takes the iron. 

ARTHUR Alas, what need you be so boist’rous-rough? I will not struggle; I will stand stone-still. For God’s sake, Hubert, let me not be bound! Nay, hear me, Hubert! Drive these men away, And I will sit as quiet as a lamb. I will not stir nor wince nor speak a word Nor look upon the iron angerly.	 Thrust but these men away, and I’ll forgive you, Whatever torment you do put me to. 

HUBERT ,  <ACTION>to Executioners</ACTION> Go stand within. Let me alone with him. 

EXECUTIONER I am best pleased to be from such a deed. 

<ACTION>Executioners exit.</ACTION> 

ARTHUR Alas, I then have chid away my friend!	 He hath a stern look but a gentle heart. Let him come back, that his compassion may Give life to yours. 

HUBERT  Come, boy, prepare yourself. 

ARTHUR Is there no remedy?	 

HUBERT None but to lose your eyes. 

ARTHUR O God, that there were but a mote in yours, A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair, Any annoyance in that precious sense. Then, feeling what small things are boisterous	 there, Your vile intent must needs seem horrible. 

HUBERT Is this your promise? Go to, hold your tongue. 

ARTHUR Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes.	 Let me not hold my tongue. Let me not, Hubert, Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue, So I may keep mine eyes. O, spare mine eyes, Though to no use but still to look on you. He seizes the iron. Lo, by my troth, the instrument is cold,	 And would not harm me. 

HUBERT ,  <ACTION>taking back the iron</ACTION> I can heat it, boy. 

ARTHUR No, in good sooth. The fire is dead with grief, Being create for comfort, to be used In undeserved extremes. See else yourself.	 There is no malice in this burning coal. The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out And strewed repentant ashes on his head. 

HUBERT But with my breath I can revive it, boy. 

ARTHUR An if you do, you will but make it blush	 And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert. Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes, And, like a dog that is compelled to fight, Snatch at his master that doth tar him on. All things that you should use to do me wrong	 Deny their office. Only you do lack That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends, Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses. 

HUBERT Well, see to live. I will not touch thine eye For all the treasure that thine uncle owes.	 Yet am I sworn, and I did purpose, boy, With this same very iron to burn them out. 

ARTHUR O, now you look like Hubert. All this while You were disguisèd. 

HUBERT Peace. No more. Adieu.	 Your uncle must not know but you are dead. I’ll fill these doggèd spies with false reports. And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world, Will not offend thee.	 

ARTHUR O heaven! I thank you, Hubert. 

HUBERT Silence. No more. Go closely in with me. Much danger do I undergo for thee. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
