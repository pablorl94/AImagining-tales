Monsieur Loyal enters. He's looking for the master of the house.

As it turns out, Loyal has been sent by Tartuffe.

Before going to meet him, Orgon asks Cléante for some advice. Cléante tells him that he just needs to keep a cool head.

When Loyal greets Orgon kindly, Orgon takes this as a sign of good will, and hopes Tartuffe is willing to compromise.

Instead, Loyal serves him with a writ, a written court document, calling for the eviction of Orgon and Co. from their own home.

Orgon can't believe it, so M. Loyal elaborates. The house, he tells Orgon, is now the property of Tartuffe. He produces a deed to prove it.

Hotheaded Damis attempts to intervene, but he's talked down by Loyal.

Loyal is sure that, with Orgon's compliance, everything will go off without a hitch. He tries to appeal to Orgon, to remind him that he is a wise and "temperate" man, and tells him that he loves "all men of upright character."

Orgon appeals to Loyal.

Out of the kindness of his heart, Loyal agrees to give Orgon a reprieve…until the next day.

Loyal will, he tells Orgon, need to spend the night…and bring a bunch of men to move out stuff…and kick Orgon and everybody else out early in the morning, but he'll do it in the most pleasant way possible.

At this point Orgon starts to lose his temper; he's ready to sock Loyal right in the nose.

Cléante steps in and tells Orgon to chill.

Damis, of course, wants to kick his butt.

And Dorine tells Loyal to his face that she'd like to see him whacked with a stick. Loyal warns that he might have to take her in if she continues to act like that.

Cléante tells Loyal to give him the paper and leave, which he does. Orgon curses him as he walks out the door.
