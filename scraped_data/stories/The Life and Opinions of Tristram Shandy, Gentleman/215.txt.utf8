Chapter 3.XCVIII. 

--'So hating, I say, to make mysteries of nothing'--I intrusted it with the post-boy, as soon as ever I got off the stones; he gave a crack with his whip to balance the compliment; and with the thill-horse trotting, and a sort of an up and a down of the other, we danced it along to Ailly au clochers, famed in days of yore for the finest chimes in the world; but we danced through it without music--the chimes being greatly out of order--(as in truth they were through all France). 

And so making all possible speed, from 

Ailly au clochers, I got to Hixcourt, from Hixcourt I got to Pequignay, and from Pequignay, I got to Amiens, concerning which town I have nothing to inform you, but what I have informed you once before--and that was--that Janatone went there to school.
