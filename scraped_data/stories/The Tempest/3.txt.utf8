<ACTION>Enter Caliban with a burden of wood. A noise ofthunder heard.</ACTION> 

CALIBAN All the infections that the sun sucks up From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him By inchmeal a disease! His spirits hear me, And yet I needs must curse. But they’ll nor pinch, Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i’ th’ mire,	 Nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark Out of my way, unless he bid ’em. But For every trifle are they set upon me, Sometimes like apes, that mow and chatter at me And after bite me; then like hedgehogs, which	 Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount Their pricks at my footfall. Sometime am I All wound with adders, who with cloven tongues Do hiss me into madness. Lo, now, lo! Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me	 For bringing wood in slowly. I’ll fall flat. Perchance he will not mind me. <ACTION>He lies down and covers himself with a cloak.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Trinculo.</ACTION> 

TRINCULO Here’s neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all. And another storm brewing; I hear it sing i’ th’ wind. Yond same black cloud, yond	 huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to hide my head. Yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. <ACTION>Noticing Caliban.</ACTION> What have we here, a man or a fish? Dead or	 alive? A fish, he smells like a fish—a very ancient and fishlike smell, a kind of not-of-the-newest poor-John. A strange fish. Were I in England now, as once I was, and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver. There	 would this monster make a man. Any strange beast there makes a man. When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legged like a man, and his fins like arms! Warm, o’ my troth! I do now let loose my	 opinion, hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt. Thunder. 

Alas, the storm is come again.My best way is to creep under his gaberdine. There is no other shelter hereabout. Misery acquaints a man	 with strange bedfellows. I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past. 

<ACTION>He crawls under Caliban’s cloak.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Stephano singing.</ACTION> 

STEPHANO "I shall no more to sea, to sea. Here shall I die ashore—" 

This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man’s funeral.	 Well, here’s my comfort.	 <ACTION>Drinks.Sings.</ACTION> 

"The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I, The gunner and his mate, Loved Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery, But none of us cared for Kate.	 For she had a tongue with a tang, Would cry to a sailor “Go hang!” She loved not the savor of tar nor of pitch, Yet a tailor might scratch her where’er she did itch. Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!"  

This is a scurvy tune too. But here’s my comfort. <ACTION>Drinks.</ACTION> 

CALIBAN Do not torment me! O! 

STEPHANO What’s the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put tricks upon ’s with savages and men of Ind? Ha? I have not scaped drowning to be afeard now	 of your four legs, for it hath been said “As proper a man as ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground,” and it shall be said so again while Stephano breathes at’ nostrils. 

CALIBAN The spirit torments me. O!	 

STEPHANO This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil should he learn our language? I will give him some relief, if it be but for that. If I can recover him and keep him tame and get to Naples with him,	 he’s a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat’s leather. 

CALIBAN Do not torment me, prithee. I’ll bring my wood home faster. 

STEPHANO  He’s in his fit now, and does not talk after	 the wisest. He shall taste of my bottle. If he have never drunk wine afore, it will go near to remove his fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will not take too much for him. He shall pay for him that hath him, and that soundly.	 

CALIBAN Thou dost me yet but little hurt. Thou wilt anon; I know it by thy trembling. Now Prosper works upon thee. 

STEPHANO Come on your ways. Open your mouth. Here is that which will give language to you, cat.	 Open your mouth. This will shake your shaking, I can tell you, and that soundly.  <ACTION>Caliban drinks.</ACTION> You cannot tell who’s your friend. Open your chaps again. 

TRINCULO I should know that voice. It should be—but	 he is drowned, and these are devils. O, defend me! 

STEPHANO Four legs and two voices—a most delicate monster! His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend. His backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle	 will recover him, I will help his ague. Come. <ACTION>Caliban drinks.</ACTION> Amen! I will pour some in thy other mouth. 

TRINCULO Stephano! 

STEPHANO Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy,	 this is a devil, and no monster! I will leave him; I have no long spoon. 

TRINCULO Stephano! If thou be’st Stephano, touch me and speak to me, for I am Trinculo—be not afeard—thy good friend Trinculo.	 

STEPHANO If thou be’st Trinculo, come forth. I’ll pull thee by the lesser legs. If any be Trinculo’s legs, these are they.  <ACTION>He pulls him out from under Caliban’scloak.</ACTION> Thou art very Trinculo indeed. How cam’st thou to be the siege of this mooncalf? Can	 he vent Trinculos? 

TRINCULO I took him to be killed with a thunderstroke. But art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me under the dead mooncalf’s	 gaberdine for fear of the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans scaped! 

STEPHANO Prithee, do not turn me about. My stomach is not constant. 

CALIBAN ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> These be fine things, an if they be not	 sprites. That’s a brave god and bears celestial liquor. I will kneel to him. <ACTION>He crawls out from under the cloak.</ACTION> 

STEPHANO ,  <ACTION>to Trinculo</ACTION> How didst thou scape? How cam’st thou hither? Swear by this bottle how thou cam’st hither—I escaped upon a butt of sack, which	 the sailors heaved o’erboard—by this bottle, which I made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands, since I was cast ashore. 

CALIBAN I’ll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject, for the liquor is not earthly.	 

STEPHANO , <ACTION> to Trinculo</ACTION> Here. Swear then how thou escapedst. 

TRINCULO Swum ashore, man, like a duck. I can swim like a duck, I’ll be sworn. 

STEPHANO Here, kiss the book.	 <ACTION>Trinculo drinks.  </ACTION> Though thou canst swim like a duck, thou art made like a goose. 

TRINCULO O Stephano, hast any more of this? 

STEPHANO The whole butt, man. My cellar is in a rock by th’ seaside, where my wine is hid.—How now,	 mooncalf, how does thine ague? 

CALIBAN Hast thou not dropped from heaven? 

STEPHANO Out o’ th’ moon, I do assure thee. I was the man i’ th’ moon when time was. 

CALIBAN I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee.	 My mistress showed me thee, and thy dog, and thy bush. 

STEPHANO Come, swear to that. Kiss the book. I will furnish it anon with new contents. Swear. <ACTION>Caliban drinks.</ACTION> 

TRINCULO  By this good light, this is a very shallow	 monster. I afeard of him? A very weak monster. The man i’ th’ moon? A most poor, credulous monster! —Well drawn, monster, in good sooth! 

CALIBAN I’ll show thee every fertile inch o’ th’ island, and I will kiss thy foot. I prithee, be my god.	 

TRINCULO By this light, a most perfidious and drunken monster. When ’s god’s asleep, he’ll rob his bottle. 

CALIBAN I’ll kiss thy foot. I’ll swear myself thy subject. 

STEPHANO Come on, then. Down, and swear. <ACTION>Caliban kneels.</ACTION> 

TRINCULO I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed	 monster. A most scurvy monster. I could find in my heart to beat him— 

STEPHANO Come, kiss. 

TRINCULO —but that the poor monster’s in drink. An abominable monster.	 

CALIBAN I’ll show thee the best springs. I’ll pluck thee berries. I’ll fish for thee and get thee wood enough. A plague upon the tyrant that I serve. I’ll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee, Thou wondrous man.	 

TRINCULO A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a poor drunkard. 

CALIBAN ,  <ACTION>standing</ACTION> I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow, And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts, Show thee a jay’s nest, and instruct thee how	 To snare the nimble marmoset. I’ll bring thee To clustering filberts, and sometimes I’ll get thee Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me? 

STEPHANO I prithee now, lead the way without any more talking.—Trinculo, the King and all our	 company else being drowned, we will inherit here. —Here, bear my bottle.—Fellow Trinculo, we’ll fill him by and by again. 

CALIBAN <ACTION>sings drunkenly</ACTION> Farewell, master, farewell, farewell. 

TRINCULO  A howling monster, a drunken monster.	 

CALIBAN  <ACTION>sings</ACTION> No more dams I’ll make for fish, Nor fetch in firing At requiring, Nor scrape trenchering, nor wash dish. ’Ban, ’ban, Ca-caliban	 Has a new master. Get a new man. Freedom, high-day! High-day, freedom! Freedom, high-day, freedom! 

STEPHANO O brave monster! Lead the way. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
