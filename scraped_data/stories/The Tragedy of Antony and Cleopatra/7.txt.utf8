<ACTION>Enter Antony, Caesar; Octavia between them.</ACTION> 

ANTONY The world and my great office will sometimes Divide me from your bosom. 

OCTAVIA All which time Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers To them for you.	 

ANTONY ,  <ACTION>to Caesar </ACTION> Goodnight, sir.—My Octavia, Read not my blemishes in the world’s report. I have not kept my square, but that to come Shall all be done by th’ rule. Good night, dear lady.—	 Good night, sir. 

CAESAR  Goodnight.	 

<ACTION>Caesar and Octavia exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Soothsayer.</ACTION> 

ANTONY Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt? 

SOOTHSAYER Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither.	 

ANTONY If you can, your reason? 

SOOTHSAYER I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue. But yet hie you to Egypt again. 

ANTONY Say to me, whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar’s or mine?	 

SOOTHSAYER Caesar’s. Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side. Thy dæmon—that thy spirit which keeps thee—is Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable, Where Caesar’s is not. But near him, thy angel	 Becomes afeard, as being o’erpowered. Therefore Make space enough between you. 

ANTONY  Speak this no more. 

SOOTHSAYER To none but thee; no more but when to thee. If thou dost play with him at any game,	 Thou art sure to lose; and of that natural luck He beats thee ’gainst the odds. Thy luster thickens When he shines by. I say again, thy spirit Is all afraid to govern thee near him; But he away, ’tis noble. 

ANTONY Get thee gone. Say to Ventidius I would speak with him. 

<ACTION>Soothsayer exits.</ACTION> 

He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap, He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him, And in our sports my better cunning faints	 Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds; His cocks do win the battle still of mine When it is all to naught, and his quails ever Beat mine, inhooped, at odds. I will to Egypt. And though I make this marriage for my peace,	 I’ th’ East my pleasure lies. 

<ACTION>Enter Ventidius.</ACTION> 

O, come, Ventidius. You must to Parthia; your commission’s ready. Follow me and receive ’t. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
