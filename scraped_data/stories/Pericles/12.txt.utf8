<ACTION>Enter Pericles, a-shipboard.</ACTION> 

PERICLES The god of this great vast, rebuke these surges, Which wash both heaven and hell! And thou that hast Upon the winds command, bind them in brass, Having called them from the deep! O, still Thy deaf’ning dreadful thunders, gently quench	 Thy nimble sulfurous flashes.—O, how, Lychorida, How does my queen?—Then, storm, venomously Wilt thou spit all thyself? The seaman’s whistle Is as a whisper in the ears of death, Unheard.—Lychorida!—Lucina, O	 Divinest patroness and midwife gentle To those that cry by night, convey thy deity Aboard our dancing boat, make swift the pangs Of my queen’s travails!—Now, Lychorida! 

<ACTION>Enter Lychorida, carrying an infant.</ACTION> 

LYCHORIDA Here is a thing too young for such a place,	 Who, if it had conceit, would die, as I Am like to do. Take in your arms this piece Of your dead queen. 

PERICLES  How? How, Lychorida? 

LYCHORIDA Patience, good sir. Do not assist the storm.	 Here’s all that is left living of your queen, A little daughter. For the sake of it, Be manly and take comfort. 

PERICLES O you gods! Why do you make us love your goodly gifts	 And snatch them straight away? We here below Recall not what we give, and therein may Use honor with you. 

LYCHORIDA Patience, good sir, Even for this charge.	 <ACTION>She hands him the infant. </ACTION> 

PERICLES ,  <ACTION>to the infant</ACTION> Now mild may be thy life, For a more blusterous birth had never babe. Quiet and gentle thy conditions, for Thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world That ever was prince’s child. Happy what follows! Thou hast as chiding a nativity As fire, air, water, earth, and heaven can make To herald thee from the womb. Even at the first, thy loss is more than can Thy portage quit, with all thou canst find here.	 Now the good gods throw their best eyes upon ’t. 

<ACTION>Enter two Sailors.</ACTION> 

FIRST SAILOR What courage, sir? God save you. 

PERICLES Courage enough. I do not fear the flaw. It hath done to me the worst. Yet for the love Of this poor infant, this fresh new seafarer,	 I would it would be quiet. 

FIRST SAILOR Slack the bowlines there!—Thou wilt not, wilt thou? Blow, and split thyself! 

SECOND SAILOR But searoom, an the brine and cloudy billow kiss the moon, I care not.	 

FIRST SAILOR Sir, your queen must overboard. The sea works high, the wind is loud, and will not lie till the ship be cleared of the dead. 

PERICLES That’s your superstition. 

FIRST SAILOR Pardon us, sir; with us at sea it hath been	 still observed, and we are strong in custom. Therefore briefly yield ’er, for she must overboard straight. 

PERICLES As you think meet.—Most wretched queen! 

LYCHORIDA  Here she lies, sir. 

PERICLES A terrible childbed hast thou had, my dear, No light, no fire. Th’ unfriendly elements Forgot thee utterly. Nor have I time To give thee hallowed to thy grave, but straight Must cast thee, scarcely coffined, in the ooze,	 Where, for a monument upon thy bones And e’er-remaining lamps, the belching whale And humming water must o’erwhelm thy corpse, Lying with simple shells.—O, Lychorida, Bid Nestor bring me spices, ink, and paper,	 My casket and my jewels; and bid Nicander Bring me the satin coffin. Lay the babe Upon the pillow. Hie thee, whiles I say A priestly farewell to her. Suddenly, woman! 

<ACTION>Lychorida exits.</ACTION> 

SECOND SAILOR Sir, we have a chest beneath the hatches,	 caulked and bitumed ready. 

PERICLES I thank thee, mariner. Say, what coast is this? 

SECOND SAILOR We are near Tarsus. 

PERICLES  Thither, gentle mariner. Alter thy course for Tyre. When canst thou reach it?	 

SECOND SAILOR By break of day if the wind cease. 

PERICLES O, make for Tarsus! There will I visit Cleon, for the babe Cannot hold out to Tyrus. There I’ll leave it At careful nursing. Go thy ways, good mariner.	 I’ll bring the body presently. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
