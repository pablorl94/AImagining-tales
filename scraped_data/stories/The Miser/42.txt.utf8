SCENE V.--ANSELME, HARPAGON, ÉLISE, MARIANNE, FROSINE, VALÈRE, THE POLICE OFFICER, MASTER JACQUES. 

ANS. What can have happened, Mr. Harpagon? You are quite upset. 

HAR. Ah, Mr. Anselme, you see in me the most unfortunate of men; and you can never imagine what vexation and disorder is connected with the contract you have come to sign! I am attacked in my property; I am attacked in my honour; and you see there a scoundrel and a wretch who has violated the most sacred rights, who has introduced himself into my house as a servant in order to steal my money, and seduce my daughter. 

VAL. Who ever thought of your money about which you rave? 

HAR. Yes; they have given each other a promise of marriage. This insult concerns you, Mr. Anselme; and it is you who ought to be plaintiff against him, and who at your own expense ought to prosecute him to the utmost, in order to be revenged. 

ANS. It is not my intention to force anybody to marry me, and to lay claim to a heart which has already bestowed itself; but as far as your interests are concerned, I am ready to espouse them as if they were my own. 

HAR. This is the gentleman, an honest commissary, who has promised that he will omit nothing of what concerns the duties of his office. (_To the_ OFFICER, _showing_ VALÈRE) Charge him, Sir, as he ought to be, and make matters very criminal. 

VAL. I do not see what crime they can make of my passion for your daughter, nor the punishment you think I ought to be condemned to for our engagement; when it is known who I am ... 

HAR. I don't care a pin for all those stories, and the world is full, nowadays, of those pretenders to nobility, of those impostors, who take advantage of their obscurity and deck themselves out insolently with the first illustrious name that comes into their head. 

VAL. Know that I am too upright to adorn myself with a name which is not mine, and that all Naples can bear testimony to my birth! 

ANS. Softly! Take care of what you are about to say. You speak before a man to whom all Naples is known, and who can soon see if your story is true. 

VAL. (_proudly putting on his hat_). I am not the man to fear anything; and if all Naples is known to you, you know who was Don Thomas d'Alburci. 

ANS. Certainly; I know who he is, and few people know him better than I do. 

HAR. I care neither for Don Thomas nor Don Martin. (_Seeing two candles burning, he blows one out_.) 

ANS. Have patience and let him speak; we shall soon know what he has to say of him. 

VAL. That it is to him that I owe my birth. 

ANS. To him? 

VAL. Yes. 

ANS. Nonsense; you are laughing. Try and make out a more likely story, and don't pretend to shelter yourself under such a piece of imposture. 

VAL. Consider your words better before you speak; it is no imposture, and I say nothing here that I cannot prove. 

ANS. What! You dare to call yourself the son of Don Thomas d'Alburci? 

VAL. Yes, I dare to do so; and I am ready to maintain the truth against anyone, who ever he may be. 

ANS. This audacity is marvellous. Learn to your confusion that it is now at least sixteen years ago since the man of whom you speak died in a shipwreck at sea with his wife and children, when he was trying to save their lives from the cruel persecutions which accompanied the troubles at Naples, and which caused the banishment of several noble families. 

VAL. Yes; but learn to your confusion that his son, seven years of age, was, with a servant, saved from the wreck by a Spanish vessel, and that this son is he who now speaks to you. Learn that the captain of that ship, touched with compassion at my misfortune, loved me; that he had me brought up as his own son, and that the profession of arms has been my occupation ever since I was fit for it; that lately I heard that my father is not dead, as I thought he was; that, passing this way to go and find him out, an accident, arranged by heaven, brought to my sight the charming Élise; that the sight of her made me a slave to her beauty, and that the violence of my love and the harshness of her father made me take the resolution to come into his house disguised as a servant, and to send some one else to look after my parents. 

ANS. But what other proofs have you besides your own words that all this is not a fable based by you upon truth. 

VAL. What proofs? The captain of the Spanish vessel; a ruby seal which belonged to my father; an agate bracelet which my mother put upon my arm; and old Pedro, that servant who was saved with me from the wreck. 

MAR. Alas! I can answer here for what you have said; that you do not deceive us; and all you say clearly tells me that you are my brother. 

VAL. You my sister! 

MAR. Yes, my heart was touched as soon as you began to speak; and our mother, who will be delighted at seeing you, often told me of the misfortunes of our family. Heaven spared us also in that dreadful wreck; but our life was spared at the cost of our liberty, for my mother and myself were taken up by pirates from the wreck of our vessel. After ten years of slavery a lucky event gave us back to liberty, and we returned to Naples, where we found all our property sold, and could hear no news of our father. We embarked for Genoa, where my mother went to gather what remained of a family estate which had been much disputed. Leaving her unjust relatives, she came here, where she has lived but a weary life. 

ANS. O heaven! how wonderful are thy doings, and how true it is that it only belongs to thee to work miracles! Come to my arms, my children, and share the joy of your happy father! 

VAL. You are our father? 

MAR. It was for you that my mother wept? 

ANS. Yes, my daughter; yes, my son; I am Don Thomas d'Alburci, whom heaven saved from the waves, with all the money he had with him, and who, after sixteen years, believing you all dead, was preparing, after long journeys, to seek the consolations of a new family in marrying a gentle and virtuous woman. The little security there was for my life in Naples has made me abandon the idea of returning there, and having found the means of selling what I had, I settled here under the name of Anselme. I wished to forget the sorrows of a name associated with so many and great troubles. 

HAR. (_to_ ANSELME). He is your son? 

ANS. Yes. 

HAR. That being so, I make you responsible for the ten thousand crowns that he has stolen from me. 

ANS. He steal anything from you! 

HAR. Yes. 

VAL. Who said so? 

HAR. Master Jacques. 

VAL. (_to_ MASTER JACQUES). You say that? 

JAC. You see that I am not saying anything. 

HAR. He certainly did. There is the officer who has received his deposition. 

VAL. Can you really believe me capable of such a base action? 

HAR. Capable or not capable, I must find my money.
