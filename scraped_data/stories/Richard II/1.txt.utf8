Scene 2 

<ACTION>Enter John of Gaunt with the Duchess of Gloucester.</ACTION> 

GAUNT Alas, the part I had in Woodstock’s blood Doth more solicit me than your exclaims To stir against the butchers of his life. But since correction lieth in those hands Which made the fault that we cannot correct, Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven, Who, when they see the hours ripe on Earth, Will rain hot vengeance on offenders’ heads. 

DUCHESS Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur? Hath love in thy old blood no living fire? Edward’s seven sons, whereof thyself art one, Were as seven vials of his sacred blood Or seven fair branches springing from one root. Some of those seven are dried by nature’s course, Some of those branches by the Destinies cut. But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester, One vial full of Edward’s sacred blood, One flourishing branch of his most royal root, Is cracked and all the precious liquor spilt, Is hacked down, and his summer leaves all faded,	 By envy’s hand and murder’s bloody ax. Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! That bed, that womb, That metal, that self mold that fashioned thee Made him a man; and though thou livest and	 breathest, Yet art thou slain in him. Thou dost consent In some large measure to thy father’s death In that thou seest thy wretched brother die, Who was the model of thy father’s life. Call it not patience, Gaunt. It is despair. In suff’ring thus thy brother to be slaughtered, Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life, Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee. 

That which in mean men we entitle patience	 Is pale, cold cowardice in noble breasts.What shall I say? To safeguard thine own life, The best way is to venge my Gloucester’s death. 

GAUNT God’s is the quarrel; for God’s substitute, His deputy anointed in His sight,	 Hath caused his death, the which if wrongfully Let heaven revenge, for I may never lift An angry arm against His minister. 

DUCHESS Where, then, alas, may I complain myself? 

GAUNT To God, the widow’s champion and defense.	 

DUCHESS Why then I will. Farewell, old Gaunt. Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight. O, sit my husband’s wrongs on Hereford’s spear, That it may enter butcher Mowbray’s breast!	 Or if misfortune miss the first career, Be Mowbray’s sins so heavy in his bosom That they may break his foaming courser’s back And throw the rider headlong in the lists, A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!	 Farewell, old Gaunt. Thy sometime brother’s wife With her companion, grief, must end her life. 

GAUNT Sister, farewell. I must to Coventry. As much good stay with thee as go with me. 

DUCHESS Yet one word more. Grief boundeth where it falls,	 Not with the empty hollowness, but weight. I take my leave before I have begun, For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done. Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York. Lo, this is all. Nay, yet depart not so!	 Though this be all, do not so quickly go; I shall remember more. Bid him—ah, what?— With all good speed at Plashy visit me. Alack, and what shall good old York there see But empty lodgings and unfurnished walls, Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones? And what hear there for welcome but my groans? Therefore commend me; let him not come there To seek out sorrow that dwells everywhere. Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die. The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.
