CHORUS. An erring seer am I,                                           I 1 Of sense and wisdom lorn, If this prophetic Power of right, O'ertaking the offender, come not nigh Ere many an hour be born. Yon vision of the night, That lately breathed into my listening ear, Hath freed me, O my daughter, from all fear. Sweet was that bodement. He doth not forget, The Achaean lord that gave thee being, nor yet The bronzen-griding axe, edged like a spear, Hungry and keen, though dark with stains of time, That in the hour of hideous crime Quelled him with cruel butchery: That, too, remembers, and shall testify. 

From ambush deep and dread                                     I 2 With power of many a hand And many hastening feet shall spring The Fury of the adamantine tread, Visiting Argive land Swift recompense to bring For eager dalliance of a blood-stained pair Unhallowed, foul, forbidden. No omen fair,-- Their impious course hath fixed this in my soul,-- Nought but black portents full of blame shall roll Before their eyes that wrought or aided there. Small force of divination would there seem In prophecy or solemn dream, Should not this vision of the night Reach harbour in reality aright. 

O chariot-course of Pelops, full of toil[4]!                    II How wearisome and sore Hath been thine issue to our native soil!-- Since, from the golden oar Hurled to the deep afar, Myrtilus sank and slept, Cruelly plucked from that fell chariot-floor, This house unceasingly hath kept Crime and misfortune mounting evermore.
