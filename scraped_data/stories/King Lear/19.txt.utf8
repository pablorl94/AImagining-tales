<ACTION>Enter with Drum and Colors, Cordelia, Doctor,Gentlemen, and Soldiers.</ACTION> 

CORDELIA Alack, ’tis he! Why, he was met even now As mad as the vexed sea, singing aloud, Crowned with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds, With hardocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckooflowers, Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow	 In our sustaining corn. A century send forth. Search every acre in the high-grown field And bring him to our eye.	 <ACTION>Soldiers exit.</ACTION> What can man’s wisdom In the restoring his bereavèd sense?	 He that helps him take all my outward worth. 

DOCTOR There is means, madam. Our foster nurse of nature is repose, The which he lacks. That to provoke in him Are many simples operative, whose power	 Will close the eye of anguish. 

CORDELIA  All blest secrets, All you unpublished virtues of the earth, Spring with my tears. Be aidant and remediate In the good man’s distress. Seek, seek for him,	 Lest his ungoverned rage dissolve the life That wants the means to lead it. 

<ACTION>Enter Messenger.</ACTION> 

MESSENGER News, madam. The British powers are marching hitherward. 

CORDELIA ’Tis known before. Our preparation stands	 In expectation of them.—O dear father, It is thy business that I go about. Therefore great France My mourning and importuned tears hath pitied. No blown ambition doth our arms incite,	 But love, dear love, and our aged father’s right. Soon may I hear and see him. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
