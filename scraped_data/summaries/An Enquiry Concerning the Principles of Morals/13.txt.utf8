Here, Hume sums up that virtue isn't about self-denial but the overall good of humanity. No enjoyment is sincere if it's cut off from society. Likewise, if society makes an individual feel unwelcome, it's not so great.

It's about what's practical. For example, liquor is harmful in a way that air and water aren't. People may think there's a clash between selfishness and social sentiments, but Hume sees this as narrow-minded since self-love and benevolence can happily coexist.

Without systems of property, society couldn't function. However, a person might sometimes think that they can carry out an offense without causing any major consequences. We're taught that honesty is the best policy, but a person might argue that there are exceptions and that a wise person would take advantage of them. For Hume, though, it's natural to rebel against any thoughts of this kind. You see? This guy was a beacon of morality.

Some folks do give into temptation, of course. Still, a person who's honest and has any sense of common reflection will see that these folks have lost out: they've gained "worthless toys" (IX.II.12) whereas it's the natural pleasures that are priceless.
