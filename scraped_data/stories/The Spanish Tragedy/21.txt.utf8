[ACT III. SCENE 12.] 

[The Spanish court.] 

Enter HIERONIMO with a ponyard in one hand, and a rope in the other. 

HIERO.  Now, sir, perhaps I come to see the king, The king sees me, and faine would heare my sute: Why, is this not a strange and seld-seene thing That standers by with toyes should strike me mute? Go too, I see their shifts, and say no more; Hieronimo, tis time for thee to trudge! Downe by the dale that flowes with purple gore Standeth a firie tower; there sits a iudge Vpon a seat of steele and molten brasse, And twixt his teeth he holdes afire-brand, That leades vnto the lake where he doth stand. Away, Hieronimo; to him be gone: Heele doe thee iustice for Horatios death. Turne down this path, thou shalt be with him straite; Or this, and then thou needst not take thy breth. This way, or that way?  Soft and faire, not so! For, if I hang or kill my-selfe, lets know Who will reuenge Horatios murther then! No, no; fie, no!  pardon me, ile none of that: 

He flings away the dagger & halter. 

This way Ile take; and this way comes the king, 

He takes them up againe. 

And heere Ile haue a fling at him, thats flat! And, Balthazar, Ile be with thee to bring; And thee, Lorenzo!  Heeres the king; nay, stay! And heere,--I, heere,--there goes the hare away! 

Enter KING, EMBASSADOR, CASTILLE, and LORENZO. 

KING.  Now shew, embassadour, what our viceroy saith: Hath hee receiu'd the articles we sent? 

HIERO.  Iustice!  O, iustice to Hieronimo! 

LOR.  Back! seest thou not the king is busie? 

HIERO.  O!  is he so? 

KING.  Who is he that interrupts our busines? 

HIERO.  Not I!  [aside] Hieronimo, beware!  goe by, goe by! 

EMBAS.  Renowned king, he hath receiued and read thy kingly proffers and thy promist league, And, as a man exreamely ouer-ioyd To heare his sonne so princely entertainde, Whose death he had so solemnely bewailde, This, for thy further satisfaction And kingly loue, he kindely lets thee know: First, for the marriage of his princely sonne With Bel-imperia, thy beloued neece, The newes are more delightfull to his soule Then myrrh or incense to the offended Heauens. In person, therefore, will be come himselfe To see the marriage rites solemnized And in the presence of the court of Spaine To knit a sure [inextricable] band Of kingly loue and euerlasting league Betwixt the crownes of Spaine and Portingale. There will he giue his crowne to Balthazar, And make a queene of Bel-imperia. 

KING.  Brother, how like you this our vice-roies loue? 

CAST.  No doubt, my lord, it is an argument Of honorable care to keepe his freend And wondrous zeale to Balthazar, his sonne. Nor am I least indebted to his Grace, That bends his liking to my daughter thus. 

EM.  Now last, dread lord, heere hath his Highnes sent-- Although he send not that his sonne returne-- His ransome doe to Don Horatio. 

HIERO.  Horatio?  who cals Horatio? 

KING.  And well remembred, thank his Maiestie! Heere, see it giuen to Horatio. 

HIERO.  Iustice!  O iustice!  iustice, gentle king! 

KING.  Who is that?  Hieronimo? 

HIERO.  Iustice!  O iustice!  O my sonne!  my sonne! My sonne, whom naught can ransome or redeeme! 

LOR.  Hieronimo, you are not well aduisde. 

HIERO.  Away, Lorenzo!  hinder me no more, For thou hast made me bankrupt of my blisse! Giue me my sonne!  You shall not ransome him! Away!  Ile rip the bowels of the earth, 

He diggeth with his dagger. 

And ferrie ouer th' Elizian plaines And bring my sonne to shew his deadly wounds. Stand from about me!  Ile make a pickaxe of my poniard, And heere surrender vp my marshalship; For Ile goe marshall vp the feends in hell, To be auenged on you all for this. 

KING.  What means this outrage? Will none of you restraine his fury? 

HIERO.  Nay, soft and faire; you shall not need to striue! Needs must he goe that the diuels driue. 

Exit. 

KING.  What accident hath hapt [to] Hieronimo? I haue not seene him to demeane him so. 

LOR.  My gratious lord, he is with extreame pride Conceiued of yong Horatio, his sonne, And couetous of hauing himselfe The ransome of the yong prince, Balthazar, Distract, and in a manner lunatick. 

KING.  Beleeue me, nephew, we are sorie for 't; This is the loue that fathers beare their sonnes. But, gentle brother, goe giue to him this golde, The princes raunsome; let him haue his due; For what he hath, Horatio shall not want. Happily Hieronimo hath need thereof. 

LOR.  But if he be thus helpelesly distract, Tis requisite his office be resignde And giuen to one of more discretion. 

KING.  We shall encrease his melanchollie so. Tis best that we see further in it first; Till when, our-selfe will exempt the place. And, brother, now bring in the embassadour, That he may be a witnes of the match Twixt Balthazar and Bel-imperia, And that we may prefixe a certaine time Wherein the marriage shalbe solemnized, That we may haue thy lord the vice-roy heere. 

EM.  Therein your Highnes highly shall content His maiestie, that longs to heare from hence. 

KING.  On then, and heare you, lord embassadour. 

Exeunt.
