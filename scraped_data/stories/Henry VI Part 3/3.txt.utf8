<ACTION>Alarum. Enter Richard, Duke of York, wearing thewhite rose.</ACTION> 

YORK The army of the Queen hath got the field. My uncles both are slain in rescuing me; And all my followers to the eager foe Turn back and fly like ships before the wind, Or lambs pursued by hunger-starvèd wolves. My sons, God knows what hath bechancèd them; But this I know: they have demeaned themselves Like men borne to renown by life or death. Three times did Richard make a lane to me And thrice cried “Courage, father, fight it out!”	 And full as oft came Edward to my side, With purple falchion painted to the hilt In blood of those that had encountered him; And when the hardiest warriors did retire, Richard cried “Charge, and give no foot of ground!”	 And cried “A crown or else a glorious tomb; A scepter or an earthly sepulcher!” With this we charged again; but, out alas, We budged again, as I have seen a swan With bootless labor swim against the tide And spend her strength with over-matching waves. A short alarum within. Ah, hark, the fatal followers do pursue, And I am faint and cannot fly their fury; And were I strong, I would not shun their fury. The sands are numbered that makes up my life. 

Here must I stay, and here my life must end.

<ACTION>Enter Queen Margaret, Clifford, Northumberland,the young Prince Edward, and Soldiers,all wearing the red rose.</ACTION> 

Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland, I dare your quenchless fury to more rage. I am your butt, and I abide your shot. 

Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.	 

CLIFFORD Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm With downright payment showed unto my father. Now Phaëton hath tumbled from his car And made an evening at the noontide prick. 

YORK My ashes, as the Phoenix’, may bring forth	 A bird that will revenge upon you all; And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven, Scorning whate’er you can afflict me with. Why come you not? What, multitudes, and fear? 

CLIFFORD So cowards fight when they can fly no further;	 So doves do peck the falcon’s piercing talons; So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives, Breathe out invectives ’gainst the officers. 

YORK O Clifford, but bethink thee once again And in thy thought o’errun my former time;	 And, if thou canst for blushing, view this face And bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this. 

CLIFFORD I will not bandy with thee word for word, But buckler with thee blows twice two for one.	 

QUEEN MARGARET Hold, valiant Clifford, for a thousand causes I would prolong a while the traitor’s life.— Wrath makes him deaf; speak thou, Northumberland. 

NORTHUMBERLAND Hold, Clifford, do not honor him so much To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart.	 What valor were it when a cur doth grin For one to thrust his hand between his teeth, When he might spurn him with his foot away? It is war’s prize to take all vantages, And ten to one is no impeach of valor.	 <ACTION>They attack York.</ACTION> 

CLIFFORD Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin. 

NORTHUMBERLAND So doth the coney struggle in the net. 

YORK So triumph thieves upon their conquered booty; So true men yield with robbers, so o’ermatched. <ACTION>York is overcome.</ACTION> 

NORTHUMBERLAND ,  <ACTION>to Queen Margaret</ACTION> What would your Grace have done unto him now?	 

QUEEN MARGARET Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland, Come, make him stand upon this molehill here That raught at mountains with outstretchèd arms, Yet parted but the shadow with his hand. 

<ACTION>They place York on a small prominence.</ACTION> 

What, was it you that would be England’s king?	 Was ’t you that reveled in our parliament And made a preachment of your high descent? Where are your mess of sons to back you now, The wanton Edward and the lusty George? And where’s that valiant crookback prodigy,	 Dickie, your boy, that with his grumbling voice Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies? Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland? Look, York, I stained this napkin with the blood That valiant Clifford with his rapier’s point	 Made issue from the bosom of the boy; And if thine eyes can water for his death, I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal. 

<ACTION>She gives him a bloody cloth.</ACTION> 

Alas, poor York, but that I hate thee deadly I should lament thy miserable state.	 I prithee grieve to make me merry, York. What, hath thy fiery heart so parched thine entrails That not a tear can fall for Rutland’s death? Why art thou patient, man? Thou shouldst be mad; And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.	 Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance. Thou would’st be fee’d, I see, to make me sport.— York cannot speak unless he wear a crown. A crown for York!  

<ACTION>She is handed a paper crown.</ACTION> 

And, lords, bow low to him.	 Hold you his hands whilst I do set it on. 

<ACTION>She puts the crown on York’s head.</ACTION> 

Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king. Ay, this is he that took King Henry’s chair, And this is he was his adopted heir. But how is it that great Plantagenet	 Is crowned so soon and broke his solemn oath?— As I bethink me, you should not be king Till our King Henry had shook hands with Death. And will you pale your head in Henry’s glory And rob his temples of the diadem	105 Now, in his life, against your holy oath? O, ’tis a fault too too unpardonable. Off with the crown and, with the crown, his head; And whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead. 

CLIFFORD That is my office, for my father’s sake.	 

QUEEN MARGARET Nay, stay, let’s hear the orisons he makes. 

YORK She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France, Whose tongue more poisons than the adder’s tooth: How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex	 To triumph like an Amazonian trull Upon their woes whom Fortune captivates. But that thy face is vizard-like, unchanging, Made impudent with use of evil deeds, I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush. To tell thee whence thou cam’st, of whom derived, Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless. Thy father bears the type of King of Naples, Of both the Sicils, and Jerusalem,	 Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman. Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult? It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen, Unless the adage must be verified That beggars mounted run their horse to death. ’Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud, But God He knows thy share thereof is small. ’Tis virtue that doth make them most admired; The contrary doth make thee wondered at. ’Tis government that makes them seem divine; The want thereof makes thee abominable. Thou art as opposite to every good As the Antipodes are unto us Or as the south to the Septentrion. 

O, tiger’s heart wrapped in a woman’s hide,	 How couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child To bid the father wipe his eyes withal, And yet be seen to bear a woman’s face?Women are soft, mild, pitiful, and flexible; Thou, stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless. Bidd’st thou me rage? Why, now thou hast thy wish. Wouldst have me weep? Why, now thou hast thy will; For raging wind blows up incessant showers, And when the rage allays, the rain begins. These tears are my sweet Rutland’s obsequies,	 And every drop cries vengeance for his death ’Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false Frenchwoman! 

NORTHUMBERLAND ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Beshrew me, but his passions moves me so That hardly can I check my eyes from tears.	 

YORK That face of his the hungry cannibals Would not have touched, would not have stained with blood; But you are more inhuman, more inexorable, O, ten times more than tigers of Hyrcania.	 See, ruthless queen, a hapless father’s tears. This cloth thou dipped’st in blood of my sweet boy, And I with tears do wash the blood away. 

<ACTION>He hands her the cloth.</ACTION> 

Keep thou the napkin and go boast of this; And if thou tell’st the heavy story right,	 Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears. Yea, even my foes will shed fast-falling tears And say “Alas, it was a piteous deed.” 

<ACTION>He hands her the paper crown.</ACTION> 

There, take the crown and, with the crown, my curse,	 And in thy need such comfort come to thee As now I reap at thy too cruel hand.— Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world, My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads. 

NORTHUMBERLAND Had he been slaughterman to all my kin,	 I should not for my life but weep with him To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul. 

QUEEN MARGARET What, weeping ripe, my Lord Northumberland? Think but upon the wrong he did us all, And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.	 

CLIFFORD ,  <ACTION>stabbing York twice</ACTION> Here’s for my oath; here’s for my father’s death! 

QUEEN MARGARET ,  <ACTION>stabbing York</ACTION> And here’s to right our gentle-hearted king. 

YORK Open thy gate of mercy, gracious God. My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee. <ACTION>He dies.</ACTION> 

QUEEN MARGARET Off with his head, and set it on York gates,	 So York may overlook the town of York. 

<ACTION>Flourish. They exit, Soldiers carrying York’s body.</ACTION>
