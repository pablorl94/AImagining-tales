<ACTION>Enter the Dauphin, Orléans, Rambures, and Beaumont.</ACTION> 

ORLÉANS The sun doth gild our armor. Up, my lords. 

DAUPHIN Montez à cheval! My horse, varlet! Lackey! Ha! 

ORLÉANS O brave spirit! 

DAUPHIN  Via les eaux et terre. 

ORLÉANS Rien puis? L’air et feu?	 

DAUPHIN Cieux, cousin Orléans. 

<ACTION>Enter Constable.</ACTION> 

Now, my Lord Constable? 

CONSTABLE Hark how our steeds for present service neigh. 

DAUPHIN Mount them, and make incision in their hides, That their hot blood may spin in English eyes	 And dout them with superfluous courage. Ha! 

RAMBURES What, will you have them weep our horses’ blood? How shall we then behold their natural tears? 

<ACTION>Enter Messenger.</ACTION> 

MESSENGER The English are embattled, you French peers. 

CONSTABLE To horse, you gallant princes, straight to horse.	 Do but behold yond poor and starvèd band, And your fair show shall suck away their souls, Leaving them but the shales and husks of men. There is not work enough for all our hands, Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins	 To give each naked curtal ax a stain, That our French gallants shall today draw out And sheathe for lack of sport. Let us but blow on them, The vapor of our valor will o’erturn them.	 ’Tis positive against all exceptions, lords, That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants, Who in unnecessary action swarm About our squares of battle, were enough To purge this field of such a hilding foe,	 Though we upon this mountain’s basis by Took stand for idle speculation, But that our honors must not. What’s to say? A very little little let us do, And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound	 The tucket sonance and the note to mount, For our approach shall so much dare the field That England shall couch down in fear and yield. 

<ACTION>Enter Grandpré.</ACTION> 

GRANDPRÉ Why do you stay so long, my lords of France? Yond island carrions, desperate of their bones,	 Ill-favoredly become the morning field. Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose, And our air shakes them passing scornfully. Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggared host And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps. The horsemen sit like fixèd candlesticks With torch staves in their hand, and their poor jades Lob down their heads, drooping the hides and hips, The gum down-roping from their pale dead eyes, And in their pale dull mouths the gemeled bit	 Lies foul with chawed grass, still and motionless. And their executors, the knavish crows, Fly o’er them all, impatient for their hour. Description cannot suit itself in words To demonstrate the life of such a battle	 In life so lifeless, as it shows itself. 

CONSTABLE They have said their prayers, and they stay for death. 

DAUPHIN Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits, And give their fasting horses provender, And after fight with them?	 

CONSTABLE I stay but for my guard. On, to the field! I will the banner from a trumpet take And use it for my haste. Come, come away. The sun is high, and we outwear the day. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
