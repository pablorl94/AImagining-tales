Master Jacques enters at the far end of the stage, talking about getting a pig ready for dinner.

The officer tells him what's going on, and a lightbulb goes on in Jacques head: he sees his opportunity to get revenge on Valère. He tells the officer and Harpagon that he saw Valère take the box of cash.

The officer, though, wants some kind of proof. Jacques stumbles through a lame testimony, since he can't say what color the cashbox is or how big it is. But Harpagon is more than willing to be convinced.

Jacques sees Valère coming and begs the officer not to tell Valère about his accusation. For obvious reasons (like, you know, Jacques's testimony was a big fat lie) Jacques wants Valère to be in the dark.
