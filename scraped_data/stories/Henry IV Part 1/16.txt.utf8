<ACTION>Enter Worcester and Sir Richard Vernon.</ACTION> 

WORCESTER O no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard, The liberal and kind offer of the King. 

VERNON ’Twere best he did. 

WORCESTER Then are we all undone. It is not possible, it cannot be	 The King should keep his word in loving us. He will suspect us still and find a time To punish this offense in other faults. Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes,	 For treason is but trusted like the fox, Who, never so tame, so cherished and locked up, Will have a wild trick of his ancestors. Look how we can, or sad or merrily, Interpretation will misquote our looks,	 And we shall feed like oxen at a stall, The better cherished still the nearer death. My nephew’s trespass may be well forgot; It hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood, And an adopted name of privilege— A harebrained Hotspur governed by a spleen. All his offenses live upon my head And on his father’s. We did train him on, And his corruption being ta’en from us, We as the spring of all shall pay for all. Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know In any case the offer of the King. 

VERNON Deliver what you will; I’ll say ’tis so. 

<ACTION>Enter Hotspur, Douglas, and their army.</ACTION> 

Here comes your cousin. 

HOTSPUR ,  <ACTION>to Douglas </ACTION> My uncle is returned.	 Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland.— Uncle, what news? 

WORCESTER The King will bid you battle presently. 

DOUGLAS , <ACTION> to Hotspur</ACTION> Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland. 

HOTSPUR Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.	 

DOUGLAS Marry, and shall, and very willingly.	 <ACTION>Douglas exits.</ACTION> 

WORCESTER There is no seeming mercy in the King. 

HOTSPUR Did you beg any? God forbid! 

WORCESTER I told him gently of our grievances, Of his oath-breaking, which he mended thus	 By now forswearing that he is forsworn. He calls us “rebels,” “traitors,” and will scourge With haughty arms this hateful name in us. 

<ACTION>Enter Douglas.</ACTION> 

DOUGLAS Arm, gentlemen, to arms. For I have thrown A brave defiance in King Henry’s teeth,	45 And Westmoreland, that was engaged, did bear it, Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on. WORCESTER The Prince of Wales stepped forth before the King, And, nephew, challenged you to single fight. HOTSPUR O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads,	50 And that no man might draw short breath today But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me, How showed his tasking? Seemed it in contempt? 

VERNON No, by my soul. I never in my life Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,	 Unless a brother should a brother dare To gentle exercise and proof of arms. He gave you all the duties of a man, Trimmed up your praises with a princely tongue, Spoke your deservings like a chronicle,	 Making you ever better than his praise By still dispraising praise valued with you, And, which became him like a prince indeed, He made a blushing cital of himself, And chid his truant youth with such a grace	 As if he mastered there a double spirit Of teaching and of learning instantly. There did he pause, but let me tell the world: If he outlive the envy of this day, England did never owe so sweet a hope So much misconstrued in his wantonness. 

HOTSPUR Cousin, I think thou art enamorèd On his follies. Never did I hear Of any prince so wild a liberty. But be he as he will, yet once ere night	 I will embrace him with a soldier’s arm That he shall shrink under my courtesy.— Arm, arm with speed, and, fellows, soldiers, friends, Better consider what you have to do	 Than I that have not well the gift of tongue Can lift your blood up with persuasion. 

<ACTION>Enter a Messenger.</ACTION> 

MESSENGER My lord, here are letters for you. 

HOTSPUR I cannot read them now.— O gentlemen, the time of life is short;	 To spend that shortness basely were too long If life did ride upon a dial’s point, Still ending at the arrival of an hour. An if we live, we live to tread on kings; If die, brave death, when princes die with us.	 Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair When the intent of bearing them is just. 

<ACTION>Enter another Messenger.</ACTION> 

SECOND MESSENGER My lord, prepare. The King comes on apace. 

HOTSPUR I thank him that he cuts me from my tale, For I profess not talking. Only this:	 Let each man do his best. And here draw I a sword, Whose temper I intend to stain With the best blood that I can meet withal In the adventure of this perilous day. Now, Esperance! Percy! And set on.	 Sound all the lofty instruments of war, And by that music let us all embrace, For, heaven to Earth, some of us never shall A second time do such a courtesy. 

<ACTION>Here they embrace. The trumpets sound.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
