Harpagon is left alone with his daughter, Élise. He informs her that he has also found a match for her—a rich, older man named Anselme who will no doubt bring a lot of money into Harpagon's family.

Élise tries to respectfully reject the idea. But Harpagon commands her to do as he says. Unfortunately, Élise depends on him completely for money, so she can't say no.

Harpagon sees his servant Valère approaching and tells Élise that they'll put the matter to him and see what he thinks of it. Élise agrees immediately, since Valère is her secret lover. She agrees to do whatever Valère thinks is right.
