Home life in the dark and dreary tenement is no treat either.

"[S]mall and ragged" Maggie—the big sister—and "bawling" Tommie (2.2)—the baby brother—are there to greet father and Jimmie in the family's chaotic, filthy apartment.

In terms of human wrath, no one compares to Mother Mary. She's Jimmie, Maggie, and Tommie's mom, as well as a raging alcoholic abuser who careens around the apartment and busts up furniture just to make a point. Nothing makes her more abusive than her son's relentless habit of getting into fights, though, and today she comes out swinging.

Oh, and Dad's an alcoholic, too, but he likes to seek respite by doing his drinking at a local bar.

Jimmie receives some sympathy from a neighbor.
