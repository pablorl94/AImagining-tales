<ACTION>Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft.</ACTION> 

JULIET Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day. It was the nightingale, and not the lark, That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.	 

ROMEO It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain-tops.	 I must be gone and live, or stay and die. 

JULIET Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhaled To be to thee this night a torchbearer And light thee on thy way to Mantua.	 Therefore stay yet. Thou need’st not to be gone. 

ROMEO Let me be ta’en; let me be put to death. I am content, so thou wilt have it so. I’ll say yon gray is not the morning’s eye; ’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow.	 Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat The vaulty heaven so high above our heads. I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is ’t, my soul? Let’s talk. It is not day.	 

JULIET It is, it is. Hie hence, begone, away! It is the lark that sings so out of tune, Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps. Some say the lark makes sweet division. This doth not so, for she divideth us.	 Some say the lark and loathèd toad changed eyes. O, now I would they had changed voices too, Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray, Hunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day. O, now begone. More light and light it grows.	 

ROMEO More light and light, more dark and dark our woes. 

<ACTION>Enter Nurse.</ACTION> 

NURSE Madam. 

JULIET Nurse? 

NURSE Your lady mother is coming to your chamber. The day is broke; be wary; look about.	 <ACTION>She exits.  </ACTION> 

JULIET Then, window, let day in, and let life out. 

ROMEO Farewell, farewell. One kiss and I’ll descend. 

<ACTION>They kiss, and Romeo descends.</ACTION> 

JULIET Art thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend! I must hear from thee every day in the hour, For in a minute there are many days.	 O, by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo. 

ROMEO Farewell. I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.	 

JULIET O, think’st thou we shall ever meet again? 

ROMEO I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve For sweet discourses in our times to come. 

JULIET O God, I have an ill-divining soul! Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low,	 As one dead in the bottom of a tomb. Either my eyesight fails or thou lookest pale. 

ROMEO And trust me, love, in my eye so do you. Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

JULIET O Fortune, Fortune, all men call thee fickle.	 If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him That is renowned for faith? Be fickle, Fortune, For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long, But send him back. 

<ACTION>Enter Lady Capulet.</ACTION> 

LADY CAPULET Ho, daughter, are you up?	 

JULIET Who is ’t that calls? It is my lady mother. Is she not down so late or up so early? What unaccustomed cause procures her hither? 

<ACTION>Juliet descends.</ACTION> 

LADY CAPULET Why, how now, Juliet? 

JULIET Madam, I am not well.	 

LADY CAPULET Evermore weeping for your cousin’s death? What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears? An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live. Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love,	 But much of grief shows still some want of wit. 

JULIET Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss. 

LADY CAPULET So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend Which you weep for. 

JULIET  Feeling so the loss,	 I cannot choose but ever weep the friend. 

LADY CAPULET Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death As that the villain lives which slaughtered him. 

JULIET What villain, madam? 

LADY CAPULET  That same villain, Romeo.	 

JULIET ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> Villain and he be many miles asunder.— God pardon him. I do with all my heart, And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart. 

LADY CAPULET That is because the traitor murderer lives. 

JULIET Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.	 Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death! 

LADY CAPULET We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not. Then weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua, Where that same banished runagate doth live, Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram	 That he shall soon keep Tybalt company. And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied. 

JULIET Indeed, I never shall be satisfied With Romeo till I behold him—dead— Is my poor heart, so for a kinsman vexed.	 Madam, if you could find out but a man To bear a poison, I would temper it, That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof, Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors To hear him named and cannot come to him	 To wreak the love I bore my cousin Upon his body that hath slaughtered him. 

LADY CAPULET Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man. But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl. 

JULIET And joy comes well in such a needy time.	 What are they, beseech your Ladyship? 

LADY CAPULET Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child, One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy That thou expects not, nor I looked not for.	 

JULIET Madam, in happy time! What day is that? 

LADY CAPULET Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.	 

JULIET Now, by Saint Peter’s Church, and Peter too, He shall not make me there a joyful bride! I wonder at this haste, that I must wed Ere he that should be husband comes to woo. I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,	 I will not marry yet, and when I do I swear It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate, Rather than Paris. These are news indeed! 

LADY CAPULET Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself, And see how he will take it at your hands.	 

<ACTION>Enter Capulet and Nurse.</ACTION> 

CAPULET When the sun sets, the earth doth drizzle dew, But for the sunset of my brother’s son It rains downright. How now, a conduit, girl? What, still in tears? Evermore show’ring? In one little body	 Thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind. For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea, Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is, Sailing in this salt flood; the winds thy sighs, Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,	 Without a sudden calm, will overset Thy tempest-tossèd body.—How now, wife? Have you delivered to her our decree? 

LADY CAPULET Ay, sir, but she will none, she gives you thanks. I would the fool were married to her grave.	 

CAPULET Soft, take me with you, take me with you, wife. How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks? Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blessed, Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bride?	 

JULIET Not proud you have, but thankful that you have. Proud can I never be of what I hate, But thankful even for hate that is meant love. 

CAPULET How, how, how, how? Chopped logic? What is this? “Proud,” and “I thank you,” and “I thank you not,”	 And yet “not proud”? Mistress minion you, Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds, But fettle your fine joints ’gainst Thursday next To go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church, Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.	 Out, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage! You tallow face! 

LADY CAPULET Fie, fie, what, are you mad? 

JULIET ,  <ACTION>kneeling</ACTION> Good father, I beseech you on my knees, Hear me with patience but to speak a word.	 

CAPULET Hang thee, young baggage, disobedient wretch! I tell thee what: get thee to church o’ Thursday, Or never after look me in the face. Speak not; reply not; do not answer me. My fingers itch.—Wife, we scarce thought us	 blessed That God had lent us but this only child, But now I see this one is one too much, And that we have a curse in having her. Out on her, hilding.	 

NURSE God in heaven bless her! You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so. 

CAPULET And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue. Good Prudence, smatter with your gossips, go. 

NURSE I speak no treason.	 

CAPULET O, God ’i’ g’ eden! 

NURSE May not one speak? 

CAPULET Peace, you mumbling fool! Utter your gravity o’er a gossip’s bowl, For here we need it not.	 

LADY CAPULET You are too hot. 

CAPULET  God’s bread, it makes me mad. Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play, Alone, in company, still my care hath been To have her matched. And having now provided	 A gentleman of noble parentage, Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly ligned, Stuffed, as they say, with honorable parts, Proportioned as one’s thought would wish a man— And then to have a wretched puling fool,	 A whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender, To answer “I’ll not wed. I cannot love. I am too young. I pray you, pardon me.” But, an you will not wed, I’ll pardon you! Graze where you will, you shall not house with me. Look to ’t; think on ’t. I do not use to jest. Thursday is near. Lay hand on heart; advise. An you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend. An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets, For, by my soul, I’ll ne’er acknowledge thee,	 Nor what is mine shall never do thee good. Trust to ’t; bethink you. 

I’ll not be forsworn.

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

JULIET Is there no pity sitting in the clouds That sees into the bottom of my grief?— O sweet my mother, cast me not away.	 Delay this marriage for a month, a week, Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies. 

LADY CAPULET Talk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word. Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.	 

<ACTION>She exits.</ACTION> 

JULIET ,  <ACTION>rising </ACTION> O God! O nurse, how shall this be prevented? My husband is on Earth, my faith in heaven. How shall that faith return again to Earth Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving Earth? Comfort me; counsel me.—	 Alack, alack, that heaven should practice stratagems Upon so soft a subject as myself.— What sayst thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? Some comfort, nurse. 

NURSE Faith, here it is.	 Romeo is banished, and all the world to nothing That he dares ne’er come back to challenge you, Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth. Then, since the case so stands as now it doth, I think it best you married with the County.	 O, he’s a lovely gentleman! Romeo’s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam, Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart, I think you are happy in this second match,	 For it excels your first, or, if it did not, Your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were As living here and you no use of him. 

JULIET Speak’st thou from thy heart? 

NURSE And from my soul too, else beshrew them both.	 

JULIET Amen. 

NURSE What? 

JULIET Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, Having displeased my father, to Lawrence’ cell	 To make confession and to be absolved. 

NURSE Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.	 <ACTION>She exits.</ACTION> 

JULIET Ancient damnation, O most wicked fiend! Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue	 Which she hath praised him with above compare So many thousand times? Go, counselor. Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain. I’ll to the Friar to know his remedy. If all else fail, myself have power to die.	 

<ACTION>She exits.</ACTION>
