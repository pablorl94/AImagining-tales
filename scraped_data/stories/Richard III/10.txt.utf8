RIVERS Sir Richard Ratcliffe, let me tell thee this: Today shalt thou behold a subject die For truth, for duty, and for loyalty. 

GREY ,  <ACTION>to Ratcliffe</ACTION> God bless the Prince from all the pack of you! A knot you are of damnèd bloodsuckers.	 

VAUGHAN ,  <ACTION>to Ratcliffe</ACTION> You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter. 

RATCLIFFE Dispatch. The limit of your lives is out. 

RIVERS O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison, Fatal and ominous to noble peers! Within the guilty closure of thy walls,	 Richard the Second here was hacked to death, And, for more slander to thy dismal seat, We give to thee our guiltless blood to drink. 

GREY Now Margaret’s curse is fall’n upon our heads, When she exclaimed on Hastings, you, and I,	 For standing by when Richard stabbed her son. 

RIVERS Then cursed she Richard. Then cursed she Buckingham. Then cursed she Hastings. O, remember, God, To hear her prayer for them as now for us!	 And for my sister and her princely sons, Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood, Which, as thou know’st, unjustly must be spilt. 

RATCLIFFE Make haste. The hour of death is expiate. 

RIVERS Come, Grey. Come, Vaughan. Let us here embrace.	 

<ACTION>They embrace.</ACTION> 

Farewell until we meet again in heaven. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
