<ACTION>Enter Sylvia and Outlaws.</ACTION> 

FIRST OUTLAW Come, come, be patient. We must bring you to our captain. 

SYLVIA A thousand more mischances than this one Have learned me how to brook this patiently. 

SECOND OUTLAW  Come, bring her away.	 

FIRST OUTLAW Where is the gentleman that was with her? 

THIRD OUTLAW Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us, But Moyses and Valerius follow him. Go thou with her to the west end of the wood; There is our captain. We’ll follow him that’s fled.	 The thicket is beset; he cannot ’scape. 

<ACTION>Second and Third Outlaws exit.</ACTION> 

FIRST OUTLAW Come, I must bring you to our captain’s cave. Fear not; he bears an honorable mind And will not use a woman lawlessly. 

SYLVIA O Valentine, this I endure for thee!	 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
