<ACTION>Enter Cornwall, and Edmund with a paper.</ACTION> 

CORNWALL I will have my revenge ere I depart his house. 

EDMUND How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think of.	 

CORNWALL  I now perceive it was not altogether your brother’s evil disposition made him seek his death, but a provoking merit set awork by a reprovable badness in himself. 

EDMUND  How malicious is my fortune that I must	 repent to be just! This is the letter he spoke of, which approves him an intelligent party to the advantages of France. O heavens, that this treason were not, or not I the detector. 

CORNWALL Go with me to the Duchess.	 

EDMUND If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty business in hand. 

CORNWALL True or false, it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester. Seek out where thy father is, that he may be ready for our apprehension. 

EDMUND ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> If I find him comforting the King, it will stuff his suspicion more fully.—I will persevere in my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore between that and my blood. 

CORNWALL I will lay trust upon thee, and thou shalt	 find a dearer father in my love. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
