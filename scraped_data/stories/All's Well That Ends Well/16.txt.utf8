<ACTION>Enter Bertram and the maid called Diana.</ACTION> 

BERTRAM They told me that your name was Fontibell. 

DIANA No, my good lord, Diana. 

BERTRAM Titled goddess, And worth it, with addition. But, fair soul, In your fine frame hath love no quality?	 If the quick fire of youth light not your mind, You are no maiden but a monument. When you are dead, you should be such a one As you are now, for you are cold and stern, And now you should be as your mother was	 When your sweet self was got. 

DIANA She then was honest. 

BERTRAM So should you be. 

DIANA No. My mother did but duty—such, my lord,	 As you owe to your wife. 

BERTRAM No more o’ that. I prithee do not strive against my vows. I was compelled to her, but I love thee By love’s own sweet constraint, and will forever	 Do thee all rights of service. 

DIANA Ay, so you serve us Till we serve you. But when you have our roses, You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves And mock us with our bareness.	 

BERTRAM How have I sworn! 

DIANA ’Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth, But the plain single vow that is vowed true. What is not holy, that we swear not by, But take the high’st to witness. Then pray you, tell	 me, If I should swear by Jove’s great attributes I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths When I did love you ill? This has no holding To swear by him whom I protest to love	 That I will work against him. Therefore your oaths Are words, and poor conditions but unsealed, At least in my opinion. 

BERTRAM  Change it, change it. Be not so holy-cruel. Love is holy,	 And my integrity ne’er knew the crafts That you do charge men with. Stand no more off, But give thyself unto my sick desires, Who then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever My love as it begins shall so persever.	 

DIANA I see that men may rope ’s in such a snare That we’ll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring. 

BERTRAM I’ll lend it thee, my dear, but have no power To give it from me. 

DIANA Will you not, my lord?	 

BERTRAM It is an honor ’longing to our house, Bequeathèd down from many ancestors, Which were the greatest obloquy i’ th’ world In me to lose. 

DIANA Mine honor’s such a ring.	 My chastity’s the jewel of our house, Bequeathèd down from many ancestors, Which were the greatest obloquy i’ th’ world In me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom Brings in the champion Honor on my part	 Against your vain assault. 

BERTRAM Here, take my ring. My house, mine honor, yea, my life be thine, And I’ll be bid by thee. 

DIANA When midnight comes, knock at my chamber	 window. I’ll order take my mother shall not hear. Now will I charge you in the band of truth, When you have conquered my yet maiden bed, Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me.	 My reasons are most strong, and you shall know them When back again this ring shall be delivered. And on your finger in the night I’ll put Another ring, that what in time proceeds May token to the future our past deeds.	 Adieu till then; then, fail not. You have won A wife of me, though there my hope be done. 

BERTRAM A heaven on Earth I have won by wooing thee. 

DIANA For which live long to thank both heaven and me! You may so in the end.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

My mother told me just how he would woo As if she sat in ’s heart. She says all men Have the like oaths. He had sworn to marry me When his wife’s dead. Therefore I’ll lie with him When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,	 Marry that will, I live and die a maid. Only, in this disguise I think ’t no sin To cozen him that would unjustly win. 

<ACTION>She exits.</ACTION>
