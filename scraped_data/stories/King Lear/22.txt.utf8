<ACTION>Enter Cordelia, Kent in disguise, Doctor, andGentleman.</ACTION> 

CORDELIA O, thou good Kent, how shall I live and work To match thy goodness? My life will be too short, And every measure fail me. 

KENT To be acknowledged, madam, is o’erpaid. All my reports go with the modest truth,	 Nor more, nor clipped, but so. 

CORDELIA Be better suited. These weeds are memories of those worser hours. I prithee put them off. 

KENT Pardon, dear madam.	 Yet to be known shortens my made intent. My boon I make it that you know me not Till time and I think meet. 

CORDELIA Then be ’t so, my good lord.—How does the King? 

DOCTOR  Madam, sleeps still.	 

CORDELIA O, you kind gods, Cure this great breach in his abusèd nature! Th’ untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up, Of this child-changèd father! 

DOCTOR So please your Majesty	 That we may wake the King? He hath slept long. 

CORDELIA Be governed by your knowledge, and proceed I’ th’ sway of your own will. Is he arrayed? 

<ACTION>Enter Lear in a chair carried by Servants.</ACTION> 

GENTLEMAN Ay, madam. In the heaviness of sleep,	 We put fresh garments on him. 

DOCTOR Be by, good madam, when we do awake him. I doubt not of his temperance. 

CORDELIA Very well. 

<ACTION>Music.</ACTION> 

DOCTOR Please you, draw near.—Louder the music there.	 

CORDELIA , <ACTION> kissing Lear</ACTION> O, my dear father, restoration hang Thy medicine on my lips, and let this kiss Repair those violent harms that my two sisters Have in thy reverence made. 

KENT Kind and dear princess.	 

CORDELIA Had you not been their father, these white flakes Did challenge pity of them. Was this a face To be opposed against the jarring winds? To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder, In the most terrible and nimble stroke	 Of quick cross-lightning? To watch, poor perdu, With this thin helm? Mine enemy’s dog, Though he had bit me, should have stood that night Against my fire. And wast thou fain, poor father, To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn	 In short and musty straw? Alack, alack, ’Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once Had not concluded all.—He wakes. Speak to him. 

DOCTOR Madam, do you; ’tis fittest. 

CORDELIA How does my royal lord? How fares your Majesty?	 

LEAR You do me wrong to take me out o’ th’ grave. Thou art a soul in bliss, but I am bound Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears Do scald like molten lead. 

CORDELIA  Sir, do you know me?	 

LEAR You are a spirit, I know. Where did you die? 

CORDELIA Still, still, far wide. 

DOCTOR He’s scarce awake. Let him alone awhile. 

LEAR Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight? I am mightily abused; I should e’en die with pity	 To see another thus. I know not what to say. I will not swear these are my hands. Let’s see. I feel this pinprick. Would I were assured Of my condition! 

CORDELIA O, look upon me, sir,	 And hold your hand in benediction o’er me. No, sir, you must not kneel. 

LEAR Pray do not mock: I am a very foolish fond old man, Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less,	 And to deal plainly, I fear I am not in my perfect mind. Methinks I should know you and know this man, Yet I am doubtful, for I am mainly ignorant What place this is, and all the skill I have	 Remembers not these garments; nor I know not Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me, For, as I am a man, I think this lady To be my child Cordelia. 

CORDELIA , <ACTION> weeping</ACTION> And so I am; I am.	 

LEAR Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray, weep not. If you have poison for me, I will drink it. I know you do not love me, for your sisters Have, as I do remember, done me wrong. You have some cause; they have not.	 

CORDELIA No cause, no cause. 

LEAR Am I in France? 

KENT  In your own kingdom, sir. 

LEAR  Do not abuse me.	 

DOCTOR Be comforted, good madam. The great rage, You see, is killed in him, and yet it is danger To make him even o’er the time he has lost. Desire him to go in. Trouble him no more Till further settling.	 

CORDELIA Will ’t please your Highness walk? 

LEAR You must bear with me. Pray you now, forget, and forgive. I am old and foolish.	 

<ACTION>They exit. Kent and Gentleman remain.</ACTION> 

GENTLEMAN Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall	 was so slain? 

KENT  Most certain, sir. 

GENTLEMAN Who is conductor of his people? 

KENT As ’tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester. 

GENTLEMAN They say Edgar, his banished son, is with	 the Earl of Kent in Germany. 

KENT Report is changeable. ’Tis time to look about. The powers of the kingdom approach apace. 

GENTLEMAN  The arbitrament is like to be bloody. Fare you well, sir.	 <ACTION>He exits.  </ACTION> 

KENT My point and period will be throughly wrought, Or well, or ill, as this day’s battle’s fought. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
