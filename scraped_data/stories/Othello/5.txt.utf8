OTHELLO Good Michael, look you to the guard tonight. Let’s teach ourselves that honorable stop Not to outsport discretion. 

CASSIO Iago hath direction what to do, But notwithstanding, with my personal eye	 Will I look to ’t. 

OTHELLO  Iago is most honest. Michael, goodnight. Tomorrow with your earliest Let me have speech with you.  <ACTION>To Desdemona.</ACTION> Come, my dear love,	 The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue; That profit’s yet to come ’tween me and you.— Goodnight. 

<ACTION>Othello and Desdemona exit, with Attendants.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Iago.</ACTION> 

CASSIO Welcome, Iago. We must to the watch. 

IAGO Not this hour, lieutenant. ’Tis not yet ten o’ th’	 clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona—who let us not therefore blame; he hath not yet made wanton the night with her, and she is sport for Jove. 

CASSIO  She’s a most exquisite lady.	 

IAGO And, I’ll warrant her, full of game. 

CASSIO Indeed, she’s a most fresh and delicate creature. 

IAGO What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley to provocation.	 

CASSIO An inviting eye, and yet methinks right modest. 

IAGO And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love? 

CASSIO She is indeed perfection. 

IAGO Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant,	 I have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello. 

CASSIO Not tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking. I could well wish	 courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment. 

IAGO O, they are our friends! But one cup; I’ll drink for you. 

CASSIO I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was	 craftily qualified too, and behold what innovation it makes here. I am unfortunate in the infirmity and dare not task my weakness with any more. 

IAGO What, man! ’Tis a night of revels. The gallants desire it.	 

CASSIO Where are they? 

IAGO Here at the door. I pray you, call them in. 

CASSIO I’ll do ’t, but it dislikes me.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

IAGO If I can fasten but one cup upon him With that which he hath drunk tonight already,	 He’ll be as full of quarrel and offense As my young mistress’ dog. Now my sick fool Roderigo, Whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out, To Desdemona hath tonight caroused	 Potations pottle-deep; and he’s to watch. Three else of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits That hold their honors in a wary distance, The very elements of this warlike isle, Have I tonight flustered with flowing cups;	 And they watch too. Now, ’mongst this flock of drunkards Am I to put our Cassio in some action That may offend the isle. But here they come. If consequence do but approve my dream,	 My boat sails freely both with wind and stream. 

<ACTION>Enter Cassio, Montano, and Gentlemen, followed byServants with wine.</ACTION> 

CASSIO  ’Fore God, they have given me a rouse already. 

MONTANO Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am a soldier.	 

IAGO Some wine, ho! 

<ACTION>Sings.	</ACTION> 

"And let me the cannikin clink, clink, And let me the cannikin clink. A soldier’s a man, O, man’s life’s but a span,	 Why, then, let a soldier drink." 

Some wine, boys! 

CASSIO  ’Fore God, an excellent song. 

IAGO I learned it in England, where indeed they are most potent in potting. Your Dane, your German,	 and your swag-bellied Hollander—drink, ho!—are nothing to your English. 

CASSIO Is your Englishman so exquisite in his drinking? 

IAGO  Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane	 dead drunk. He sweats not to overthrow your Almain. He gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled. 

CASSIO To the health of our general! 

MONTANO I am for it, lieutenant, and I’ll do you	 justice. 

IAGO O sweet England! 

<ACTION>Sings.</ACTION> 

King Stephen was and-a worthy peer, His breeches cost him but a crown; He held them sixpence all too dear;	 With that he called the tailor lown. He was a wight of high renown, And thou art but of low degree; ’Tis pride that pulls the country down, Then take thy auld cloak about thee."  

Some wine, ho! 

CASSIO ’Fore God, this is a more exquisite song than the other! 

IAGO  Will you hear ’t again? 

CASSIO No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place	 that does those things. Well, God’s above all; and there be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved. 

IAGO It’s true, good lieutenant. 

CASSIO  For mine own part—no offense to the General,	 nor any man of quality—I hope to be saved. 

IAGO  And so do I too, lieutenant. 

CASSIO Ay, but, by your leave, not before me. The Lieutenant is to be saved before the Ancient. Let’s have no more of this. Let’s to our affairs. God	 forgive us our sins! Gentlemen, let’s look to our business. Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk. This is my ancient, this is my right hand, and this is my left. I am not drunk now. I can stand well enough, and I speak well enough.	 

GENTLEMEN  Excellent well. 

CASSIO Why, very well then. You must not think then that I am drunk.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

MONTANO To th’ platform, masters. Come, let’s set the watch. 

<ACTION>Gentlemen exit.</ACTION> 

IAGO ,  <ACTION>to Montano</ACTION> You see this fellow that is gone before?	 He’s a soldier fit to stand by Caesar And give direction; and do but see his vice. ’Tis to his virtue a just equinox, The one as long as th’ other. ’Tis pity of him. I fear the trust Othello puts him in,	 On some odd time of his infirmity, Will shake this island. 

MONTANO But is he often thus? 

IAGO ’Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep. He’ll watch the horologe a double set	 If drink rock not his cradle. 

MONTANO It were well The General were put in mind of it. Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio	 And looks not on his evils. Is not this true? 

<ACTION>Enter Roderigo.</ACTION> 

IAGO ,  <ACTION>aside to Roderigo</ACTION> How now, Roderigo? I pray you, after the Lieutenant, go. 

<ACTION>Roderigo exits.</ACTION> 

MONTANO And ’tis great pity that the noble Moor Should hazard such a place as his own second	 With one of an engraffed infirmity. It were an honest action to say so To the Moor. 

IAGO Not I, for this fair island. I do love Cassio well and would do much	 To cure him of this evil— <ACTION>“	Help, help!” within.</ACTION> But hark! What noise? 

<ACTION>Enter Cassio, pursuing Roderigo.</ACTION> 

CASSIO Zounds, you rogue, you rascal! 

MONTANO What’s the matter, lieutenant? 

CASSIO A knave teach me my duty? I’ll beat the knave	 into a twiggen bottle. 

RODERIGO Beat me? 

CASSIO Dost thou prate, rogue?	 

<ACTION>He hits Roderigo.</ACTION> 

MONTANO Nay, good lieutenant. I pray you, sir, hold your hand.	 

CASSIO Let me go, sir, or I’ll knock you o’er the mazard. 

MONTANO Come, come, you’re drunk. 

CASSIO  Drunk? 

<ACTION>They fight.</ACTION> 

IAGO ,  <ACTION>aside to Roderigo</ACTION> Away, I say! Go out and cry a mutiny.	 

<ACTION>Roderigo exits.</ACTION> 

Nay, good lieutenant.—God’s will, gentlemen!— Help, ho! Lieutenant—sir—Montano—sir— Help, masters!—Here’s a goodly watch indeed! 

<ACTION>A bell is rung.</ACTION> 

Who’s that which rings the bell? Diablo, ho! The town will rise. God’s will, lieutenant, hold!	 You will be shamed forever. 

<ACTION>Enter Othello and Attendants.</ACTION> 

OTHELLO What is the matter here? 

MONTANO Zounds, I bleed still. I am hurt to th’ death. He dies!	 <ACTION>He attacks Cassio.  </ACTION> 

OTHELLO Hold, for your lives! 

IAGO Hold, ho! Lieutenant—sir—Montano— gentlemen— Have you forgot all sense of place and duty? Hold! The General speaks to you. Hold, for shame!	 

OTHELLO Why, how now, ho! From whence ariseth this? Are we turned Turks, and to ourselves do that Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites? For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl! He that stirs next to carve for his own rage	 Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion. Silence that dreadful bell. It frights the isle From her propriety. What is the matter, masters? Honest Iago, that looks dead with grieving, Speak. Who began this? On thy love, I charge thee.	 

IAGO I do not know. Friends all but now, even now, In quarter and in terms like bride and groom Divesting them for bed; and then but now, As if some planet had unwitted men, Swords out, and tilting one at other’s breast,	 In opposition bloody. I cannot speak Any beginning to this peevish odds, And would in action glorious I had lost Those legs that brought me to a part of it! 

OTHELLO How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?	 

CASSIO I pray you pardon me; I cannot speak. 

OTHELLO Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil. The gravity and stillness of your youth The world hath noted. And your name is great In mouths of wisest censure. What’s the matter	 That you unlace your reputation thus, And spend your rich opinion for the name Of a night-brawler? Give me answer to it. 

MONTANO Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger. Your officer Iago can inform you,	 While I spare speech, which something now offends me, Of all that I do know; nor know I aught By me that’s said or done amiss this night, Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,	 And to defend ourselves it be a sin When violence assails us. 

OTHELLO Now, by heaven, My blood begins my safer guides to rule, And passion, having my best judgment collied,	 Assays to lead the way. Zounds, if I stir, Or do but lift this arm, the best of you Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know How this foul rout began, who set it on; And he that is approved in this offense,	 Though he had twinned with me, both at a birth, Shall lose me. What, in a town of war Yet wild, the people’s hearts brimful of fear, To manage private and domestic quarrel, In night, and on the court and guard of safety?	 ’Tis monstrous. Iago, who began ’t? 

MONTANO If partially affined, or leagued in office, Thou dost deliver more or less than truth, Thou art no soldier. 

IAGO  Touch me not so near.	 I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offense to Michael Cassio. Yet I persuade myself, to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general: Montano and myself being in speech,	 There comes a fellow crying out for help, And Cassio following him with determined sword To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman Pointing to Montano. Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause. Myself the crying fellow did pursue,	 Lest by his clamor—as it so fell out— The town might fall in fright. He, swift of foot, Outran my purpose, and I returned the rather For that I heard the clink and fall of swords And Cassio high in oath, which till tonight	 I ne’er might say before. When I came back— For this was brief—I found them close together At blow and thrust, even as again they were When you yourself did part them. More of this matter cannot I report.	 But men are men; the best sometimes forget. Though Cassio did some little wrong to him, As men in rage strike those that wish them best, Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received From him that fled some strange indignity	 Which patience could not pass. 

OTHELLO I know, Iago, Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter, Making it light to Cassio.—Cassio, I love thee, But nevermore be officer of mine.	 

<ACTION>Enter Desdemona attended.</ACTION> 

Look if my gentle love be not raised up! I’ll make thee an example. 

DESDEMONA What is the matter, dear? 

OTHELLO All’s well now, sweeting.	 Come away to bed.  <ACTION>To Montano. </ACTION> Sir, for your hurts, Myself will be your surgeon.—Lead him off. <ACTION>Montano is led off.</ACTION> Iago, look with care about the town And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.—	 Come, Desdemona. ’Tis the soldier’s life To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife. 

<ACTION>All but Iago and Cassio exit.</ACTION> 

IAGO What, are you hurt, lieutenant? 

CASSIO Ay, past all surgery. 

IAGO Marry, God forbid!	 

CASSIO Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation, Iago, my reputation! 

IAGO As I am an honest man, I thought you had	 received some bodily wound. There is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false imposition, oft got without merit and lost without deserving. You have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What,	 man, there are ways to recover the General again! You are but now cast in his mood—a punishment more in policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion. Sue to him again and he’s yours.	 

CASSIO I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? And speak parrot? And squabble? Swagger? Swear? And discourse fustian with one’s own shadow? O thou	 invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil! 

IAGO What was he that you followed with your sword? What had he done to you? 

CASSIO  I know not.	 

IAGO Is ’t possible? 

CASSIO I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains! That we should	 with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause transform ourselves into beasts! 

IAGO  Why, but you are now well enough. How came you thus recovered? 

CASSIO It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give	 place to the devil wrath. One unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly despise myself. 

IAGO Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place, and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not so befallen. But	 since it is as it is, mend it for your own good. 

CASSIO I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently	 a beast! O, strange! Every inordinate cup is unblessed, and the ingredient is a devil. 

IAGO Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used. Exclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.	 

CASSIO I have well approved it, sir.—I drunk! 

IAGO  You or any man living may be drunk at a time, man. I’ll tell you what you shall do. Our general’s wife is now the general: I may say so in this respect, for that he hath devoted and given up	 himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and graces. Confess yourself freely to her. Importune her help to put you in your place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her	 goodness not to do more than she is requested. This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter, and, my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before. 

CASSIO You advise me well. 

IAGO  I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness. 

CASSIO I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake	 for me. I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here. 

IAGO You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant. I must to the watch. 

CASSIO Good night, honest Iago.	 <ACTION>Cassio exits.  </ACTION> 

IAGO And what’s he, then, that says I play the villain, When this advice is free I give and honest, Probal to thinking, and indeed the course To win the Moor again? For ’tis most easy Th’ inclining Desdemona to subdue	 In any honest suit. She’s framed as fruitful As the free elements. And then for her To win the Moor—were ’t to renounce his baptism, All seals and symbols of redeemèd sin— His soul is so enfettered to her love	 That she may make, unmake, do what she list, Even as her appetite shall play the god With his weak function. How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course Directly to his good? Divinity of hell! When devils will the blackest sins put on, They do suggest at first with heavenly shows, As I do now. For whiles this honest fool Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune, And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,	 I’ll pour this pestilence into his ear: That she repeals him for her body’s lust; And by how much she strives to do him good, She shall undo her credit with the Moor. 

So will I turn her virtue into pitch,	 And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all.

<ACTION>Enter Roderigo.</ACTION> 

How now, Roderigo? 

RODERIGO I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My	 money is almost spent, I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled, and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains, and so, with no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.	 

IAGO How poor are they that have not patience! What wound did ever heal but by degrees? Thou know’st we work by wit and not by witchcraft, And wit depends on dilatory time. Does ’t not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,	 And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashiered Cassio. Though other things grow fair against the sun, Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe. Content thyself awhile. By th’ Mass, ’tis morning! Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.	 Retire thee; go where thou art billeted. Away, I say! Thou shalt know more hereafter. Nay, get thee gone.	 

<ACTION>Roderigo exits.</ACTION> 

Two things are to be done. My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress.	 I’ll set her on. Myself the while to draw the Moor apart And bring him jump when he may Cassio find Soliciting his wife. Ay, that’s the way. Dull not device by coldness and delay.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
