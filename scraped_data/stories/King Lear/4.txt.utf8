<ACTION>Enter Lear, Kent in disguise, Gentleman, and Fool.</ACTION> 

LEAR ,  <ACTION>to Kent</ACTION> Go you before to Gloucester with these letters. Acquaint my daughter no further with anything you know than comes from her demand out of the letter. If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore you.	 

KENT I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered your letter.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

FOOL  If a man’s brains were in ’s heels, were ’t not in danger of kibes? 

LEAR  Ay, boy.	 

FOOL Then, I prithee, be merry; thy wit shall not go slipshod. 

LEAR Ha, ha, ha! 

FOOL Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly, for, though she’s as like this as a crab’s like an	 apple, yet I can tell what I can tell. 

LEAR What canst tell, boy? 

FOOL  She will taste as like this as a crab does to a crab. Thou canst tell why one’s nose stands i’ th’ middle on ’s face?	 

LEAR No. 

FOOL Why, to keep one’s eyes of either side ’s nose, that what a man cannot smell out he may spy into. 

LEAR I did her wrong. 

FOOL  Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?	 

LEAR  No. 

FOOL Nor I neither. But I can tell why a snail has a house. 

LEAR Why? 

FOOL Why, to put ’s head in, not to give it away to his	30 daughters and leave his horns without a case. 

LEAR I will forget my nature. So kind a father!—Be my horses ready?	 

<ACTION>Gentleman exits.</ACTION> 

FOOL  Thy asses are gone about ’em. The reason why the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty	 reason. 

LEAR Because they are not eight. 

FOOL Yes, indeed. Thou wouldst make a good Fool. 

LEAR To take ’t again perforce! Monster ingratitude! 

FOOL If thou wert my Fool, nuncle, I’d have thee	 beaten for being old before thy time. 

LEAR How’s that? 

FOOL  Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise. 

LEAR O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!	 Keep me in temper. I would not be mad! 

<ACTION>Enter Gentleman.</ACTION> 

How now, are the horses ready? 

GENTLEMAN Ready, my lord. 

LEAR Come, boy. 

FOOL She that’s a maid now and laughs at my departure,	 Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
