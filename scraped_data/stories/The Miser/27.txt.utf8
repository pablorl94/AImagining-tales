SCENE XII.--HARPAGON, MARIANNE, ÉLISE, CLÉANTE, VALÈRE, FROSINE. 

HAR. (_to_ MARIANNE). I hope you will excuse me, my dear, but I forgot to order some refreshments for you, before you went out. 

CLE. I have thought of it, father, and have ordered to be brought in here some baskets of China oranges, sweet citrons, and preserves, which I sent for in your name. 

HAR. (_aside, to_ VALÈRE). Valère! 

VAL. (_aside, to_ HARPAGON). He has lost his senses! 

CLE. You are afraid, father, that it will not be enough? I hope, Madam, that you will have the kindness to excuse it. 

MAR. It was by no means necessary. 

CLE. Did you ever see, Madam, a more brilliant diamond than the one my father has upon his finger? 

MAR. It certainly sparkles very much. 

CLE. (_taking the diamond off his father's finger_). You must see it near. 

MAR. It is a beautiful one; it possesses great lustre. 

CLE. (_steps before_ MARIANNE, _who wants to restore it_). No, Madam, it is in hands too beautiful; it is a present my father gives you. 

HAR. I? 

CLE. Is it not true, father, that you wish her to keep it for your sake? 

HAR. (_aside, to his son_). What? 

CLE. (_to_ MARIANNE). A strange question indeed! He is making me signs that I am to force you to accept it. 

MAR. I would not.... 

CLE. (_to_ MARIANNE). I beg of you.... He would not take it back. 

HAR. (_aside_). I am bursting with rage! 

MAR. It would be ... 

CLE. (_still hindering_ MARIANNE _from returning it_). No; I tell you, you will offend him. 

MAR. Pray ... 

CLE. By no means. 

HAR. (_aside_). Plague take ... 

CLE. He is perfectly shocked at your refusal. 

HAR. (_aside, to his son_). Ah! traitor! 

CLE. (_to_ MARIANNE). You see he is in despair. 

HAR. (_aside, to his son, threatening him_). You villain! 

CLE. Really, father, it is not my fault. I do all I can to persuade her to accept it; but she is obstinate. 

HAR. (_in a rage, aside to his son_). Rascal! 

CLE. You are the cause, Madam, of my father scolding me. 

HAR. (_aside, with the same looks_). Scoundrel! 

CLE. (_to_ MARIANNE). You will make him ill; for goodness' sake, hesitate no longer. 

FRO. (_to_ MARIANNE). Why so much ceremony? Keep the ring, since the gentleman wishes you to. 

MAR. (_to_ HARPAGON). I will keep it now, Sir, in order not to make you angry, and I shall take another opportunity of returning it to you.
