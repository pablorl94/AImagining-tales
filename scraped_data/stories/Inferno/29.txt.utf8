CANTO XXX. 

Because of Semele[759] when Juno's ire Was fierce 'gainst all that were to Thebes allied, As had been proved by many an instance dire; So mad grew Athamas[760] that when he spied His wife as she with children twain drew near, Each hand by one encumbered, loud he cried: 'Be now the nets outspread, that I may snare Cubs with the lioness at yon strait ground!' And stretching claws of all compassion bare He on Learchus seized and swung him round,                        10 And shattered him upon a flinty stone; Then she herself and the other burden drowned. And when by fortune was all overthrown The Trojans' pride, inordinate before-- Monarch and kingdom equally undone-- Hecuba,[761] sad and captive, mourning o'er Polyxena, when dolorous she beheld The body of her darling Polydore Upon the coast, out of her wits she yelled, And spent herself in barking like a hound;                      20 So by her sorrow was her reason quelled. But never yet was Trojan fury[762] found, Nor that of Thebes, to sting so cruelly Brute beasts, far less the human form to wound, As two pale naked shades were stung, whom I Saw biting run, like swine when they escape Famished and eager from the empty sty. 

Capocchio[763] coming up to, in his nape One fixed his fangs, and hauling at him made His belly on the stony pavement scrape.30 The Aretine[764] who stood, still trembling, said: 'That imp is Gianni Schicchi,[765] and he goes Rabid, thus trimming others.' 'O!' I prayed, 'So may the teeth of the other one of those Not meet in thee, as, ere she pass from sight, Thou freely shalt the name of her disclose.' And he to me: 'That is the ancient sprite Of shameless Myrrha,[766] who let liking rise For him who got her, past all bounds of right. As, to transgress with him, she in disguise                       40 Came near to him deception to maintain; So he, departing yonder from our eyes, That he the Lady of the herd might gain, Bequeathed his goods by formal testament While he Buoso Donate's[767] form did feign.' And when the rabid couple from us went, Who all this time by me were being eyed, Upon the rest ill-starred I grew intent; And, fashioned like a lute, I one espied, Had he been only severed at the place                           50 Where at the groin men's lower limbs divide. 

The grievous dropsy, swol'n with humours base, Which every part of true proportion strips Till paunch grows out of keeping with the face, Compelled him widely ope to hold his lips Like one in fever who, by thirst possessed, Has one drawn up while the other chinward slips.'O ye! [768] who by no punishment distressed, Nor know I why, are in this world of dool,' He said; 'a while let your attention rest                       60 On Master Adam[769] here of misery full. Living, I all I wished enjoyed at will; Now lust I for a drop of water cool. The water-brooks that down each grassy hill Of Casentino to the Arno fall And with cool moisture all their courses fill-- Always, and not in vain, I see them all; Because the vision of them dries me more Than the disease 'neath which my face grows small. For rigid justice, me chastising sore,                            70 Can in the place I sinned at motive find To swell the sighs in which I now deplore. There lies Romena, where of the money coined[770] With the Baptist's image I made counterfeit, And therefore left my body burnt behind. 

But could I see here Guido's[771] wretched sprite, Or Alexander's, or their brother's, I For Fonte Branda[772] would not give the sight.One is already here, unless they lie-- Mad souls with power to wander through the crowd-- What boots it me, whose limbs diseases tie? 81 But were I yet so nimble that I could Creep one poor inch a century, some while Ago had I begun to take the road Searching for him among this people vile; And that although eleven miles[773] 'tis long, And has a width of more than half a mile. Because of them am I in such a throng; For to forge florins I by them was led, Which by three carats[774] of alloy were wrong,'                90 'Who are the wretches twain,' I to him said, 'Who smoke[775] like hand in winter-time fresh brought From water, on thy right together spread?' 'Here found I them, nor have they budged a jot,' He said, 'since I was hurled into this vale; And, as I deem, eternally they'll not. 

One[776] with false charges Joseph did assail; False Sinon,[777] Greek from Troy, is the other wight.Burning with fever they this stink exhale.' Then one of them, perchance o'ercome with spite                  100 Because he thus contemptuously was named, Smote with his fist upon the belly tight. It sounded like a drum; and then was aimed A blow by Master Adam at his face With arm no whit less hard, while he exclaimed: 'What though I can no longer shift my place Because my members by disease are weighed! I have an arm still free for such a case.' To which was answered: 'When thou wast conveyed Unto the fire 'twas not thus good at need,                     110 But even more so when the coiner's trade Was plied by thee.' The swol'n one: 'True indeed! But thou didst not bear witness half so true When Trojans[778] at thee for the truth did plead.' 'If I spake falsely, thou didst oft renew False coin,' said Sinon; 'one fault brought me here; Thee more than any devil of the crew.' 'Bethink thee of the horse, thou perjurer,' He of the swol'n paunch answered; 'and that by All men 'tis known should anguish in thee stir.' 

120 'Be thirst that cracks thy tongue thy penalty, And putrid water,' so the Greek replied, 'Which 'fore thine eyes thy stomach moundeth high.'The coiner then: 'Thy mouth thou openest wide, As thou art used, thy slanderous words to vent; But if I thirst and humours plump my hide Thy head throbs with the fire within thee pent. To lap Narcissus' mirror,[779] to implore And urge thee on would need no argument.' While I to hear them did attentive pore                          130 My Master said: 'Thy fill of staring take! To rouse my anger needs but little more.' And when I heard that he in anger spake Toward him I turned with such a shame inspired, Recalled, it seems afresh on me to break. And, as the man who dreams of hurt is fired With wish that he might know his dream a dream, And so what is, as 'twere not, is desired; So I, struck dumb and filled with an extreme Craving to find excuse, unwittingly                            140 The meanwhile made the apology supreme. 'Less shame,' my Master said, 'would nullify A greater fault, for greater guilt atone; All sadness for it, therefore, lay thou by. 

But bear in mind that thou art not alone, If fortune hap again to bring thee near Where people such debate are carrying on.To things like these 'tis shame[780] to lend an ear.'
