<ACTION>Enter Dionyza with Leonine.</ACTION> 

DIONYZA Thy oath remember. Thou hast sworn to do ’t. ’Tis but a blow which never shall be known. Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience, Which is but cold in flaming, thy bosom inflame	 Too nicely. Nor let pity, which even women Have cast off, melt thee; but be a soldier To thy purpose. 

LEONINE I will do ’t; but yet She is a goodly creature.	 

DIONYZA The fitter, then, The gods should have her. Here she comes weeping For her only mistress’ death. Thou art resolved? 

LEONINE I am resolved. 

<ACTION>Enter Marina with a basket of flowers.</ACTION> 

MARINA No, I will rob Tellus of her weed	 To strew thy green with flowers. The yellows, blues, The purple violets and marigolds Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave While summer days doth last. Ay me, poor maid, Born in a tempest when my mother died,	 This world to me is as a lasting storm, Whirring me from my friends. 

DIONYZA How now, Marina? Why do you keep alone? How chance my daughter is not with you? Do not consume your blood with sorrowing. Have you a nurse of me! Lord, how your favor ’s Changed with this unprofitable woe. Come, give me your flowers. O’er the sea marge Walk with Leonine. The air is quick there, And it pierces and sharpens the stomach.—Come,	 Leonine, Take her by the arm. Walk with her. 

MARINA No, I pray you, I’ll not bereave you of your servant. 

DIONYZA   Come, come.	 I love the king your father and yourself With more than foreign heart. We every day Expect him here. When he shall come and find Our paragon to all reports thus blasted, He will repent the breadth of his great voyage,	 Blame both my lord and me that we have taken No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you, Walk, and be cheerful once again. Reserve That excellent complexion, which did steal The eyes of young and old. Care not for me.	 I can go home alone. 

MARINA  Well, I will go, But yet I have no desire to it. 

DIONYZA  Come, come, I know ’tis good for you.—Walk half an hour,	 Leonine, at the least. Remember What I have said. 

LEONINE I warrant you, madam. 

DIONYZA I’ll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while. Pray walk softly; do not heat your blood.	 What, I must have care of you. 

MARINA  My thanks, sweet madam. <ACTION>	Dionyza exits.</ACTION> Is this wind westerly that blows? 

LEONINE Southwest. 

MARINA When I was born, the wind was north.	 

LEONINE  Was ’t so? 

MARINA My father, as nurse says, did never fear, But cried “Good seamen!” to the sailors, Galling his kingly hands haling ropes, And, clasping to the mast, endured a sea	 That almost burst the deck. 

LEONINE   When was this? 

MARINA  When I was born. Never was waves nor wind more violent, And from the ladder-tackle washes off	 A canvas-climber. “Ha!” says one, “Wolt out?” And with a dropping industry they skip From stern to stern. The Boatswain whistles, and The Master calls and trebles their confusion. 

LEONINE   Come, say your prayers. 

<ACTION>He draws his sword.</ACTION> 

MARINA   What mean you? 

LEONINE If you require a little space for prayer, I grant it. Pray, but be not tedious, for The gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn To do my work with haste. 

MARINA Why will you kill me? 

LEONINE To satisfy my lady. 

MARINA Why would she have me killed? Now, as I can remember, by my troth, I never did her hurt in all my life. I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn To any living creature. Believe me, la, I never killed a mouse, nor hurt a fly. I trod upon a worm against my will, But I wept for ’t. How have I offended	 Wherein my death might yield her any profit Or my life imply her any danger? 

LEONINE My commission Is not to reason of the deed, but do ’t. 

MARINA You will not do ’t for all the world, I hope.	 You are well-favored, and your looks foreshow You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately When you caught hurt in parting two that fought. Good sooth, it showed well in you. Do so now. Your lady seeks my life. Come you between,	 And save poor me, the weaker. 

LEONINE I am sworn And will dispatch.	 <ACTION>He seizes her.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Pirates.</ACTION> 

FIRST PIRATE Hold, villain!  

<ACTION>Leonine runs offstage.</ACTION> 

SECOND PIRATE  A prize, a prize!	 <ACTION>He seizes Marina.  </ACTION> 

THIRD PIRATE Half-part, mates, half-part. Come, let’s have her aboard suddenly. 

<ACTION>They exit, carrying Marina.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Leonine.</ACTION> 

LEONINE These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes, And they have seized Marina. Let her go. There’s no hope she will return. I’ll swear she’s dead,	 And thrown into the sea. But I’ll see further. Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her, Not carry her aboard. If she remain, Whom they have ravished must by me be slain. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
