Chapter 4.LXIV. 

As Tom's place, an' please your honour, was easy--and the weather warm--it put him upon thinking seriously of settling himself in the world; and as it fell out about that time, that a Jew who kept a sausage shop in the same street, had the ill luck to die of a strangury, and leave his widow in possession of a rousing trade--Tom thought (as every body in Lisbon was doing the best he could devise for himself) there could be no harm in offering her his service to carry it on: so without any introduction to the widow, except that of buying a pound of sausages at her shop--Tom set out--counting the matter thus within himself, as he walk'd along; that let the worst come of it that could, he should at least get a pound of sausages for their worth--but, if things went well, he should be set up; inasmuch as he should get not only a pound of sausages--but a wife and--a sausage shop, an' please your honour, into the bargain. 

Every servant in the family, from high to low, wish'd Tom success; and I can fancy, an' please your honour, I see him this moment with his white dimity waist-coat and breeches, and hat a little o' one side, passing jollily along the street, swinging his stick, with a smile and a chearful word for every body he met:--But alas! Tom! thou smilest no more, cried the corporal, looking on one side of him upon the ground, as if he apostrophised him in his dungeon. 

Poor fellow! said my uncle Toby, feelingly. 

He was an honest, light-hearted lad, an' please your honour, as ever blood warm'd-- 

--Then he resembled thee, Trim, said my uncle Toby, rapidly. 

The corporal blush'd down to his fingers ends--a tear of sentimental bashfulness--another of gratitude to my uncle Toby--and a tear of sorrow for his brother's misfortunes, started into his eye, and ran sweetly down his cheek together; my uncle Toby's kindled as one lamp does at another; and taking hold of the breast of Trim's coat (which had been that of Le Fever's) as if to ease his lame leg, but in reality to gratify a finer feeling--he stood silent for a minute and a half; at the end of which he took his hand away, and the corporal making a bow, went on with his story of his brother and the Jew's widow.
