<ACTION>Enter Archbishop of York and Sir Michael.</ACTION> 

ARCHBISHOP , handing papers Hie, good Sir Michael, bear this sealèd brief With wingèd haste to the Lord Marshal, This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest To whom they are directed. If you knew How much they do import, you would make haste. 

SIR MICHAEL My good lord, I guess their tenor. 

ARCHBISHOP Like enough you do. Tomorrow, good Sir Michael, is a day Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men Must bide the touch. For, sir, at Shrewsbury,	 As I am truly given to understand, The King with mighty and quick-raisèd power Meets with Lord Harry. And I fear, Sir Michael, What with the sickness of Northumberland, Whose power was in the first proportion,	 And what with Owen Glendower’s absence thence, Who with them was a rated sinew too And comes not in, o’erruled by prophecies, I fear the power of Percy is too weak To wage an instant trial with the King.	 

SIR MICHAEL Why, my good lord, you need not fear. There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer. 

ARCHBISHOP   No, Mortimer is not there. 

SIR MICHAEL But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy, And there is my Lord of Worcester, and a head	 Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen. 

ARCHBISHOP And so there is. But yet the King hath drawn The special head of all the land together: The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster, The noble Westmoreland, and warlike Blunt,	 And many more corrivals and dear men Of estimation and command in arms. 

SIR MICHAEL Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed. 

ARCHBISHOP I hope no less, yet needful ’tis to fear; And to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed.	 For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the King Dismiss his power he means to visit us, For he hath heard of our confederacy, And ’tis but wisdom to make strong against him. Therefore make haste. I must go write again	 To other friends. And so farewell, Sir Michael.
