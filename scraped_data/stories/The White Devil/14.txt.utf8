SCENE V 

Enter Francisco, Lodovico, and Hortensio 

Lodo.   My lord, upon my soul you shall no further; You have most ridiculously engag'd yourself Too far already.  For my part, I have paid All my debts: so, if I should chance to fall, My creditors fall not with me; and I vow, To quit all in this bold assembly, To the meanest follower.  My lord, leave the city, Or I 'll forswear the murder.                                    [Exit. 

Fran.   Farewell, Lodovico: If thou dost perish in this glorious act, I 'll rear unto thy memory that fame, Shall in the ashes keep alive thy name.                          [Exit. 

Hort.   There 's some black deed on foot.  I 'll presently Down to the citadel, and raise some force. These strong court-factions, that do brook no checks, In the career oft break the riders' necks.                       [Exit.
