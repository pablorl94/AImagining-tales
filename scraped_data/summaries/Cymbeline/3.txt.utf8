Imogen begs Pisanio for any morsel about her lovey-dovey, Posthumus. When she asks what he heard Posthumus talk about last, Pisanio says it was about her, of course.

Pisanio remembers his master kissed his handkerchief and waved it goodbye. Then Imogen wishes she were that handkerchief, so she could be kissed by him. Wait, what? Where have we heard that before? Oh yeah: in Romeo and Juliet.

There's lots of talk about how Imogen wishes she were actually with Posthumus. Then Pisanio says his master talked of how he hopes to commune with her in spirit. That's sort of like a Skype date for psychics.

A lady enters, telling Imogen the Queen wants to see her.
