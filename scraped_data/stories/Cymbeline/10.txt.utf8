<ACTION>Enter Posthumus and Philario.</ACTION> 

POSTHUMUS Fear it not, sir. I would I were so sure To win the King as I am bold her honor Will remain hers. 

PHILARIO What means do you make to him? 

POSTHUMUS Not any, but abide the change of time,	 Quake in the present winter’s state, and wish That warmer days would come. In these feared hopes I barely gratify your love; they failing, I must die much your debtor.	 

PHILARIO Your very goodness and your company O’erpays all I can do. By this, your king Hath heard of great Augustus. Caius Lucius Will do ’s commission throughly. And I think He’ll grant the tribute, send th’ arrearages,	 Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance Is yet fresh in their grief. 

POSTHUMUS I do believe, Statist though I am none nor like to be, That this will prove a war; and you shall hear	 The legion now in Gallia sooner landed In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen Are men more ordered than when Julius Caesar Smiled at their lack of skill but found their courage	 Worthy his frowning at. Their discipline, Now wingèd with their courages, will make known To their approvers they are people such That mend upon the world. 

<ACTION>Enter Iachimo.</ACTION> 

PHILARIO See, Iachimo!	 

POSTHUMUS The swiftest harts have posted you by land, And winds of all the corners kissed your sails To make your vessel nimble. 

PHILARIO Welcome, sir. 

POSTHUMUS I hope the briefness of your answer made	 The speediness of your return. 

IACHIMO Your lady Is one of the fairest that I have looked upon. 

POSTHUMUS And therewithal the best, or let her beauty Look thorough a casement to allure false hearts	 And be false with them. 

IACHIMO , handing him a paper  Here are letters for you. 

POSTHUMUS Their tenor good, I trust. 

IACHIMO  ’Tis very like. <ACTION>Posthumus reads the letter.</ACTION> 

PHILARIO Was Caius Lucius in the Briton court	 When you were there? 

IACHIMO He was expected then, but not approached. 

POSTHUMUS All is well yet. Sparkles this stone as it was wont, or is ’t not Too dull for your good wearing? <ACTION>He indicates his ring.</ACTION> 

IACHIMO If I have lost it, I should have lost the worth of it in gold. I’ll make a journey twice as far t’ enjoy A second night of such sweet shortness which Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won.	 

POSTHUMUS The stone’s too hard to come by. 

IACHIMO Not a whit, Your lady being so easy. 

POSTHUMUS Make not, sir, Your loss your sport. I hope you know that we	 Must not continue friends. 

IACHIMO Good sir, we must, If you keep covenant. Had I not brought The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant We were to question farther; but I now Profess myself the winner of her honor, Together with your ring, and not the wronger Of her or you, having proceeded but By both your wills. 

POSTHUMUS If you can make ’t apparent	 That you have tasted her in bed, my hand And ring is yours. If not, the foul opinion You had of her pure honor gains or loses Your sword or mine, or masterless leave both To who shall find them.	 

IACHIMO Sir, my circumstances, Being so near the truth as I will make them, Must first induce you to believe; whose strength I will confirm with oath, which I doubt not You’ll give me leave to spare when you shall find	 You need it not. 

POSTHUMUS  Proceed. 

IACHIMO First, her bedchamber— Where I confess I slept not, but profess Had that was well worth watching—it was hanged	 With tapestry of silk and silver, the story Proud Cleopatra when she met her Roman And Cydnus swelled above the banks, or for The press of boats or pride. A piece of work So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive	 In workmanship and value, which I wondered Could be so rarely and exactly wrought Since the true life on ’t was— 

POSTHUMUS This is true, And this you might have heard of here, by me	 Or by some other. 

IACHIMO More particulars Must justify my knowledge. 

POSTHUMUS So they must, Or do your honor injury.	 

IACHIMO  The chimney Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece Chaste Dian bathing. Never saw I figures So likely to report themselves; the cutter Was as another Nature, dumb, outwent her,	 Motion and breath left out. 

POSTHUMUS This is a thing Which you might from relation likewise reap, Being, as it is, much spoke of. 

IACHIMO The roof o’ th’ chamber	 With golden cherubins is fretted. Her andirons— I had forgot them—were two winking Cupids Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely Depending on their brands. 

POSTHUMUS This is her honor?	 Let it be granted you have seen all this—and praise Be given to your remembrance—the description Of what is in her chamber nothing saves The wager you have laid. 

IACHIMO Then if you can	 Be pale, I beg but leave to air this jewel. See— He shows the bracelet. And now ’tis up again. It must be married To that your diamond. I’ll keep them. 

POSTHUMUS Jove! Once more let me behold it. Is it that	 Which I left with her? 

IACHIMO Sir, I thank her, that. She stripped it from her arm. I see her yet. Her pretty action did outsell her gift And yet enriched it too. She gave it me	 And said she prized it once. 

POSTHUMUS Maybe she plucked it off To send it me. 

IACHIMO  She writes so to you, doth she? 

POSTHUMUS O, no, no, no, ’tis true. Here, take this too.	 <ACTION>He gives Iachimo the ring.</ACTION> It is a basilisk unto mine eye, Kills me to look on ’t. Let there be no honor Where there is beauty, truth where semblance, love Where there’s another man. The vows of women Of no more bondage be to where they are made	 Than they are to their virtues, which is nothing. O, above measure false! 

PHILARIO Have patience, sir, And take your ring again. ’Tis not yet won. It may be probable she lost it; or	 Who knows if one her women, being corrupted, Hath stol’n it from her. 

POSTHUMUS   Very true, And so I hope he came by ’t.—Back, my ring! <ACTION>He takes back the ring.</ACTION> Render to me some corporal sign about her	 More evident than this, for this was stol’n. 

IACHIMO By Jupiter, I had it from her arm. 

POSTHUMUS Hark you, he swears! By Jupiter he swears. ’Tis true—nay, keep the ring—’tis true. <ACTION>He holds out the ring.</ACTION> I am sure	 She would not lose it. Her attendants are All sworn and honorable. They induced to steal it? And by a stranger? No, he hath enjoyed her. The cognizance of her incontinency Is this. She hath bought the name of whore thus	 dearly. There, take thy hire, and all the fiends of hell Divide themselves between you! <ACTION>He gives the ring to Iachimo.</ACTION> 

PHILARIO  Sir, be patient. This is not strong enough to be believed	 Of one persuaded well of. 

POSTHUMUS Never talk on ’t. She hath been colted by him. 

IACHIMO If you seek For further satisfying, under her breast,	 Worthy the pressing, lies a mole, right proud Of that most delicate lodging. By my life, I kissed it, and it gave me present hunger To feed again, though full. You do remember This stain upon her?	 

POSTHUMUS Ay, and it doth confirm Another stain as big as hell can hold, Were there no more but it. 

IACHIMO Will you hear more? 

POSTHUMUS   Spare your arithmetic;	 Never count the turns. Once, and a million! 

IACHIMO I’ll be sworn— 

POSTHUMUS  No swearing. If you will swear you have not done ’t, you lie, And I will kill thee if thou dost deny	 Thou ’st made me cuckold. 

IACHIMO I’ll deny nothing. 

POSTHUMUS O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal! I will go there and do ’t i’ th’ court, before Her father. I’ll do something.	 <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

PHILARIO Quite beside The government of patience. You have won. Let’s follow him and pervert the present wrath He hath against himself. 

IACHIMO With all my heart.	 <ACTION>They exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Posthumus.</ACTION> 

POSTHUMUS Is there no way for men to be, but women Must be half-workers? We are all bastards, And that most venerable man which I Did call my father was I know not where When I was stamped. Some coiner with his tools	 Made me a counterfeit; yet my mother seemed The Dian of that time; so doth my wife The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance! Me of my lawful pleasure she restrained And prayed me oft forbearance; did it with	 A pudency so rosy the sweet view on ’t Might well have warmed old Saturn, that I thought her As chaste as unsunned snow. O, all the devils! This yellow Iachimo in an hour, was ’t not? Or less? At first? Perchance he spoke not, but, Like a full-acorned boar, a German one, Cried “O!” and mounted; found no opposition But what he looked for should oppose and she Should from encounter guard. 

Could I find out	 The woman’s part in me—for there’s no motion That tends to vice in man but I affirm It is the woman’s part: be it lying, note it, The woman’s; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers; Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;	 Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain, Nice longing, slanders, mutability, All faults that have a name, nay, that hell knows, Why, hers, in part or all, but rather all.For even to vice	30 They are not constant, but are changing still One vice but of a minute old for one Not half so old as that. I’ll write against them, Detest them, curse them. Yet ’tis greater skill In a true hate to pray they have their will;	 The very devils cannot plague them better. <ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
