[CHORUS.] 

Enter GHOAST and REUENGE. 

GHOST.  Awake Erictho!  Cerberus, awake! Sollicite Pluto, gentle Proserpine! To combat, Achinon and Ericus in hell! For neere by Stix and Phlegeton [there came.] Nor ferried Caron to the fierie lakes, Such fearfull sights, as poore Andrea see[s]? Reuenge awake! 

REUENGE.              Awake?  for-why? 

GHOST.  Awake, Reuenge!  for thou art ill aduisde To sleepe away what thou art warnd to watch! 

REUENGE.  Content thy-selfe, and doe not trouble me. 

GHOST.  Awake, Reuenge, if loue, as loue hath had, Haue yet the power of preuailance in hell! Hieronimo with Lorenzo is ioynde in league, And intecepts our passage to reuenge. Awake, Reuenge, or we are woe-begone! 

REUENGE.  Thus worldings ground what they haue dreamd vpon! Content thy-selfe, Andrea; though I sleepe, Yet is my mood soliciting their soules. Sufficeth thee that poore Hieronimo Cannot forget his sonne Horatio. Nor dies Reuegne although he sleepe a-while; For in vnquiet, quietnes is faind, And slumbring is a common worldly wile. Beholde, Andrea, for an instance how Reuenge hath slept; and then imagine thou What tis to be subiect to destinie. 

Enter a Dumme-show. 

GHOST.  Awake, Reuenge!  reueale this misterie! 

REUENGE.  The two first [do] the nuptiall torches beare, As brightly burning as the mid-daies sunne; But after them doth Himen hie as fast, Clothed in sable and saffron robe, And blowes them out and quencheth them with blood, As discontent that things continue so. 

GHOST.  Sufficeth me; thy meanings vnderstood, And thanks to thee and those infernall powers That will not tollerate a louers woe. Rest thee; for I will sit to see the rest. 

REUENGE.  Then argue not; for thou hast thy request. 

Exeunt.
