Orgon rolls in, having just come from a trip out of town.

He proceeds to ignore Cléante.

He wants to hear about what's happened to the family in the time since he left.

Dorine tells him that Elmire has been sick with a fever, but all Orgon really wants to hear about is Tartuffe. Every time Dorine tells him anything about his wife – all about how she's felt sick and suffered – he says, "And Tartuffe?"

Dorine tells him that he's been doing fine, eating, drinking and sleeping altogether too much for such a pious guy.

That doesn't stop Orgon from exclaiming "Poor fellow!" again and again. This goes on for a while. It's what a comedian might call a "routine" or a "bit."

When Dorine has had enough, she goes off to tell Elmire how "sympathetic" Orgon has been.
