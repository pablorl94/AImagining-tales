<ACTION>Alarum within. Enter King Duncan, Malcolm,Donalbain, Lennox, with Attendants, meeting a bleedingCaptain.</ACTION> 

DUNCAN What bloody man is that? He can report, As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt The newest state. 

MALCOLM This is the sergeant Who, like a good and hardy soldier, fought	 ’Gainst my captivity.—Hail, brave friend! Say to the King the knowledge of the broil As thou didst leave it. 

CAPTAIN Doubtful it stood, As two spent swimmers that do cling together	 And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald (Worthy to be a rebel, for to that The multiplying villainies of nature Do swarm upon him) from the Western Isles Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;	 And Fortune, on his damnèd quarrel smiling, Showed like a rebel’s whore. But all’s too weak; For brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name), Disdaining Fortune, with his brandished steel, Which smoked with bloody execution,	 Like Valor’s minion, carved out his passage Till he faced the slave; Which ne’er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him, Till he unseamed him from the nave to th’ chops, And fixed his head upon our battlements.	 

DUNCAN O valiant cousin, worthy gentleman! 

CAPTAIN As whence the sun ’gins his reflection Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break, So from that spring whence comfort seemed to come	 Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark: No sooner justice had, with valor armed, Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels, But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage, With furbished arms and new supplies of men,	 Began a fresh assault. 

DUNCAN Dismayed not this our captains, Macbeth and Banquo? 

CAPTAIN Yes, as sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion. If I say sooth, I must report they were	 As cannons overcharged with double cracks, So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe. Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds Or memorize another Golgotha, I cannot tell—	 But I am faint. My gashes cry for help. 

DUNCAN So well thy words become thee as thy wounds: They smack of honor both.—Go, get him surgeons. 

<ACTION>The Captain is led off by Attendants.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Ross and Angus.</ACTION> 

Who comes here? 

MALCOLM The worthy Thane of Ross.	 

LENNOX What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look that seems to speak things strange. 

ROSS  God save the King. 

DUNCAN  Whence cam’st thou, worthy thane?	 

ROSS  From Fife, great king, Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky And fan our people cold. Norway himself, with terrible numbers, Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,	 The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict, Till that Bellona’s bridegroom, lapped in proof, Confronted him with self-comparisons, Point against point, rebellious arm ’gainst arm, Curbing his lavish spirit. And to conclude,	 The victory fell on us. 

DUNCAN  Great happiness! 

ROSS That now Sweno, The Norways’ king, craves composition. Nor would we deign him burial of his men	 Till he disbursèd at Saint Colme’s Inch Ten thousand dollars to our general use. 

DUNCAN No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive Our bosom interest. Go, pronounce his present death,	 And with his former title greet Macbeth. 

ROSS I’ll see it done. 

DUNCAN What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
