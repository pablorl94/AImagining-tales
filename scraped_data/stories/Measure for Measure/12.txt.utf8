<ACTION>Enter Pompey.</ACTION> 

POMPEY I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house of profession. One would think it were Mistress Overdone’s own house, for here be many of her old customers. First, here’s young Master Rash. He’s in for a commodity of brown paper and old	 ginger, ninescore and seventeen pounds, of which he made five marks ready money. Marry, then ginger was not much in request, for the old women were all dead. Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of Master Three-pile the mercer, for some	 four suits of peach-colored satin, which now peaches him a beggar. Then have we here young Dizzy and young Master Deep-vow, and Master Copper-spur and Master Starve-lackey the rapier-and-dagger man, and young Drop-heir that killed	 lusty Pudding, and Master Forth-light the tilter, and brave Master Shoe-tie the great traveler, and wild Half-can that stabbed Pots, and I think forty more, all great doers in our trade, and are now “for the Lord’s sake.”	 

<ACTION>Enter Abhorson.</ACTION> 

ABHORSON Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither. 

POMPEY , <ACTION> calling</ACTION> Master Barnardine, you must rise and be hanged, Master Barnardine. 

ABHORSON , <ACTION> calling</ACTION> What ho, Barnardine! 

BARNARDINE ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> A pox o’ your throats! Who makes	 that noise there? What are you? 

POMPEY , <ACTION> calling to Barnardine offstage</ACTION> Your friends, sir, the hangman. You must be so good, sir, to rise and be put to death. 

BARNARDINE ,  <ACTION>within</ACTION> Away, you rogue, away! I am	 sleepy. 

ABHORSON , <ACTION> to Pompey</ACTION> Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too. 

POMPEY ,  <ACTION>calling</ACTION> Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are executed, and sleep afterwards.	 

ABHORSON Go in to him, and fetch him out. 

POMPEY He is coming, sir, he is coming. I hear his straw rustle. 

ABHORSON Is the axe upon the block, sirrah? 

POMPEY  Very ready, sir.	 

<ACTION>Enter Barnardine.</ACTION> 

BARNARDINE How now, Abhorson? What’s the news with you? 

ABHORSON Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your prayers, for, look you, the warrant’s come. 

BARNARDINE You rogue, I have been drinking all night.	 I am not fitted for ’t. 

POMPEY O, the better, sir, for he that drinks all night and is hanged betimes in the morning may sleep the sounder all the next day. 

<ACTION>Enter Duke, as a Friar.</ACTION> 

ABHORSON , <ACTION> to Barnardine</ACTION> Look you, sir, here comes your ghostly father. Do we jest now, think you? 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar, to Barnardine </ACTION> Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort you, and pray with you.		 

BARNARDINE Friar, not I. I have been drinking hard all night, and I will have more time to prepare me, or they shall beat out my brains with billets. I will not consent to die this day, that’s certain. 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> O, sir, you must. And therefore I	 beseech you look forward on the journey you shall go. 

BARNARDINE I swear I will not die today for any man’s persuasion. 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> But hear you—	 

BARNARDINE Not a word. If you have anything to say to me, come to my ward, for thence will not I today. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> Unfit to live or die. O gravel heart! After him, fellows; bring him to the block. 

<ACTION>Abhorson and Pompey exit.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Provost.</ACTION> 

PROVOST Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?	 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> A creature unprepared, unmeet for death, And to transport him in the mind he is Were damnable. 

PROVOST Here in the prison, father, There died this morning of a cruel fever	 One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate, A man of Claudio’s years, his beard and head Just of his color. What if we do omit This reprobate till he were well inclined, And satisfy the Deputy with the visage	 Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio? 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> O, ’tis an accident that heaven provides! Dispatch it presently. The hour draws on Prefixed by Angelo. See this be done And sent according to command, whiles I	 Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die. 

PROVOST This shall be done, good father, presently. But Barnardine must die this afternoon, And how shall we continue Claudio, To save me from the danger that might come	 If he were known alive? 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> Let this be done: Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio. Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting	 To yonder generation, you shall find Your safety manifested. 

PROVOST  I am your free dependent. 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo. 

<ACTION>Provost exits.</ACTION> 

DUKE Now will I write letters to Angelo—	 The Provost he shall bear them—whose contents Shall witness to him I am near at home And that by great injunctions I am bound To enter publicly. Him I’ll desire To meet me at the consecrated fount	 A league below the city; and from thence, By cold gradation and well-balanced form, We shall proceed with Angelo. 

<ACTION>Enter Provost, carrying a head.</ACTION> 

PROVOST Here is the head. I’ll carry it myself. 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> Convenient is it. Make a swift return,	 For I would commune with you of such things That want no ear but yours. 

PROVOST I’ll make all speed. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

ISABELLA , <ACTION> within</ACTION> Peace, ho, be here. 

DUKE The tongue of Isabel. She’s come to know	 If yet her brother’s pardon be come hither. But I will keep her ignorant of her good To make her heavenly comforts of despair When it is least expected. 

<ACTION>Enter Isabella.</ACTION> 

ISABELLA Ho, by your leave.	 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter. 

ISABELLA The better, given me by so holy a man. Hath yet the Deputy sent my brother’s pardon? 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> He hath released him, Isabel, from the world. His head is off, and sent to Angelo.	 

ISABELLA Nay, but it is not so. 

DUKE ,  <ACTION>as Friar</ACTION> It is no other. Show your wisdom, daughter, in your close patience. 

ISABELLA O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes! 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> You shall not be admitted to his sight.	 

ISABELLA Unhappy Claudio, wretched Isabel, Injurious world, most damnèd Angelo! 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot. Forbear it, therefore; give your cause to heaven. Mark what I say, which you shall find	 By every syllable a faithful verity. The Duke comes home tomorrow—nay, dry your eyes. One of our convent, and his confessor, Gives me this instance. Already he hath carried	 Notice to Escalus and Angelo, Who do prepare to meet him at the gates, There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom In that good path that I would wish it go,	 And you shall have your bosom on this wretch, Grace of the Duke, revenges to your heart, And general honor. 

ISABELLA I am directed by you. 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar, showing her a paper</ACTION> This letter, then, to Friar Peter give.	 ’Tis that he sent me of the Duke’s return. Say, by this token, I desire his company At Mariana’s house tonight. Her cause and yours I’ll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you Before the Duke, and to the head of Angelo	 Accuse him home and home. For my poor self, I am combinèd by a sacred vow And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter. 

<ACTION>He hands her the paper.</ACTION> 

Command these fretting waters from your eyes With a light heart. Trust not my holy order	 If I pervert your course.—Who’s here? 

<ACTION>Enter Lucio.</ACTION> 

LUCIO Good even, friar, where’s the Provost? 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> Not within, sir. 

LUCIO O, pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes so red. Thou must be patient. I am fain to	 dine and sup with water and bran. I dare not for my head fill my belly. One fruitful meal would set me to ’t. But they say the Duke will be here tomorrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother. If the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been at home,	 he had lived.	 

<ACTION>Isabella exits.</ACTION> 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar </ACTION> Sir, the Duke is marvelous little beholding to your reports, but the best is, he lives not in them. 

LUCIO Friar, thou knowest not the Duke so well as I do.	 He’s a better woodman than thou tak’st him for. 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> Well, you’ll answer this one day. Fare you well. 

LUCIO Nay, tarry, I’ll go along with thee. I can tell thee pretty tales of the Duke.	 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar </ACTION> You have told me too many of him already, sir, if they be true; if not true, none were enough. 

LUCIO I was once before him for getting a wench with child.	 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar </ACTION> Did you such a thing? 

LUCIO Yes, marry, did I, but I was fain to forswear it. They would else have married me to the rotten medlar. 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar </ACTION> Sir, your company is fairer than honest.	 Rest you well. 

LUCIO By my troth, I’ll go with thee to the lane’s end. If bawdy talk offend you, we’ll have very little of it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr. I shall stick. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
