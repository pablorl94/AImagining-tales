Chapter 3.LXXI. 

My uncle Toby took the ivory pipe out of the corporal's hand,--looked at it for half a minute, and returned it. 

In less than two minutes, my uncle Toby took the pipe from the corporal again, and raised it half way to his mouth--then hastily gave it back a second time. 

The corporal redoubled the attack,--my uncle Toby smiled,--then looked grave,--then smiled for a moment,--then looked serious for a long time;--Give me hold of the ivory pipe, Trim, said my uncle Toby--my uncle Toby put it to his lips,--drew it back directly,--gave a peep over the horn-beam hedge;--never did my uncle Toby's mouth water so much for a pipe in his life.--My uncle Toby retired into the sentry-box with the pipe in his hand.-- 

--Dear uncle Toby! don't go into the sentry-box with the pipe,--there's no trusting a man's self with such a thing in such a corner.
