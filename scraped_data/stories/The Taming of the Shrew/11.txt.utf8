<ACTION>Enter Petruchio, Katherine, Hortensio, and Servants.</ACTION> 

PETRUCHIO Come on, i’ God’s name, once more toward our father’s. Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon! 

KATHERINE The moon? The sun! It is not moonlight now. 

PETRUCHIO I say it is the moon that shines so bright.	 

KATHERINE I know it is the sun that shines so bright. 

PETRUCHIO Now, by my mother’s son, and that’s myself, It shall be moon, or star, or what I list, Or e’er I journey to your father’s house. <ACTION>To Servants. </ACTION> Go on, and fetch our horses back	 again.— Evermore crossed and crossed, nothing but crossed! 

HORTENSIO ,  <ACTION>to Katherine</ACTION> Say as he says, or we shall never go. 

KATHERINE Forward, I pray, since we have come so far, And be it moon, or sun, or what you please.	 And if you please to call it a rush candle, Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me. 

PETRUCHIO I say it is the moon. 

KATHERINE I know it is the moon. 

PETRUCHIO Nay, then you lie. It is the blessèd sun.	 

KATHERINE Then God be blest, it is the blessèd sun. But sun it is not, when you say it is not, And the moon changes even as your mind. What you will have it named, even that it is, And so it shall be so for Katherine.	 

HORTENSIO Petruchio, go thy ways, the field is won. 

PETRUCHIO Well, forward, forward. Thus the bowl should run, And not unluckily against the bias. But soft! Company is coming here. 

<ACTION>Enter Vincentio.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>To Vincentio. </ACTION> Good morrow, gentle mistress, where	 away?— Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly, too, Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman? Such war of white and red within her cheeks! What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty	 As those two eyes become that heavenly face?— Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.— Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty’s sake. 

HORTENSIO , <ACTION> aside</ACTION> He will make the man mad, to make the woman of him.		 

KATHERINE Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet, Whither away, or where is thy abode? Happy the parents of so fair a child! Happier the man whom favorable stars Allots thee for his lovely bedfellow.	 

PETRUCHIO Why, how now, Kate? I hope thou art not mad! This is a man—old, wrinkled, faded, withered— And not a maiden, as thou sayst he is. 

KATHERINE Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes That have been so bedazzled with the sun	 That everything I look on seemeth green. Now I perceive thou art a reverend father. Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking. 

PETRUCHIO Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known Which way thou travelest. If along with us,	 We shall be joyful of thy company. 

VINCENTIO Fair sir, and you, my merry mistress, That with your strange encounter much amazed me, My name is called Vincentio, my dwelling Pisa, And bound I am to Padua, there to visit	 A son of mine which long I have not seen. 

PETRUCHIO What is his name? 

VINCENTIO Lucentio, gentle sir. 

PETRUCHIO Happily met, the happier for thy son. And now by law as well as reverend age,	 I may entitle thee my loving father. The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman, Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not, Nor be not grieved. She is of good esteem, Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth;	 Beside, so qualified as may beseem The spouse of any noble gentleman. Let me embrace with old Vincentio, And wander we to see thy honest son, Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.	 

VINCENTIO But is this true, or is it else your pleasure, Like pleasant travelers, to break a jest Upon the company you overtake? 

HORTENSIO I do assure thee, father, so it is. 

PETRUCHIO Come, go along and see the truth hereof,	 For our first merriment hath made thee jealous. 

<ACTION>All but Hortensio exit.</ACTION> 

HORTENSIO Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart! Have to my widow, and if she be froward, Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward. 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION>
