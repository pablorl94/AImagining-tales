The old neighbor has problems of her own. She's a beggar and a thief, but for now, she's Jimmie's only option. She dispatches Jimmie to buy her a can of beer.

Unfortunately, Jimmie's father intercepts him and steals the beer. He can't cope with the "livin hell" at home either.

Jimmie hangs out before returning to the apartment. He can hear his parents fighting, threatening, and perpetrating violence on each other; the neighbors comment on how "Ol' Johnson" is at it again. Apparently the parents have earned a bit of a reputation for hand-to-hand combat.

Jimmie finally gathers the courage to return, and when he does, he finds his drunken parents passed out on the floor.

He and Maggie hold each other, quivering and scared, until "the ghost mists of dawn" (3.33) arrive.
