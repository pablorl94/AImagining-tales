<ACTION>Alarums to the fight, wherein both the Staffords areslain. Enter Cade and the rest.</ACTION> 

CADE   Where’s Dick, the butcher of Ashford? 

DICK Here, sir. 

CADE   They fell before thee like sheep and oxen, and thou behaved’st thyself as if thou hadst been in thine own slaughterhouse. Therefore, thus will I	 reward thee: the Lent shall be as long again as it is, and thou shalt have a license to kill for a hundred lacking one. 

DICK I desire no more. 

CADE  And to speak truth, thou deserv’st no less. This	 monument of the victory will I bear. He puts on Sir Humphrey Stafford’s armor and helmet, or sallet. And the bodies shall be dragged at my horse heels till I do come to London, where we will have the Mayor’s sword borne before us. 

DICK If we mean to thrive and do good, break open	 the jails and let out the prisoners. 

CADE  Fear not that, I warrant thee. Come, let’s march towards London.
