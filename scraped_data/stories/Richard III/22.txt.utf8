<ACTION>Enter King Richard, in arms, with Norfolk, Ratcliffe, andthe Earl of Surrey, with Soldiers.</ACTION> 

RICHARD Here pitch our tent, even here in Bosworth field. Soldiers begin to pitch the tent. My lord of Surrey, why look you so sad? 

SURREY My heart is ten times lighter than my looks. 

RICHARD My lord of Norfolk— 

NORFOLK Here, most gracious liege.	 

RICHARD Norfolk, we must have knocks, ha, must we not? 

NORFOLK We must both give and take, my loving lord. 

RICHARD Up with my tent!—Here will I lie tonight. But where tomorrow? Well, all’s one for that. Who hath descried the number of the traitors?	 

NORFOLK Six or seven thousand is their utmost power. 

RICHARD Why, our battalia trebles that account. Besides, the King’s name is a tower of strength Which they upon the adverse faction want.— Up with the tent!—Come, noble gentlemen, Let us survey the vantage of the ground. Call for some men of sound direction; Let’s lack no discipline, make no delay, For, lords, tomorrow is a busy day. 

<ACTION>The tent now in place, they exit.</ACTION>
