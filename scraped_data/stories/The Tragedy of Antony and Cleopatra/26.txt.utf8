<ACTION>Enter Antony, Cleopatra, Enobarbus, Charmian, Iras,with others.</ACTION> 

ANTONY He will not fight with me, Domitius? 

ENOBARBUS No. 

ANTONY Why should he not? 

ENOBARBUS He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune, He is twenty men to one.	 

ANTONY Tomorrow, soldier, By sea and land I’ll fight. Or I will live Or bathe my dying honor in the blood Shall make it live again. Woo’t thou fight well? 

ENOBARBUS I’ll strike and cry “Take all.”	 

ANTONY  Well said. Come on. Call forth my household servants. 

<ACTION>Enter three or four Servitors.</ACTION> 

Let’s tonight Be bounteous at our meal.—Give me thy hand; Thou hast been rightly honest.—So hast thou,—	15 Thou,—and thou,—and thou. You have served me well, And kings have been your fellows. 

CLEOPATRA ,  <ACTION>aside to Enobarbus</ACTION> What means this? 

ENOBARBUS ,  <ACTION>aside to Cleopatra</ACTION> ’Tis one of those odd tricks which sorrow shoots	 Out of the mind. 

ANTONY , <ACTION> to another Servitor </ACTION> And thou art honest too. I wish I could be made so many men, And all of you clapped up together in An Antony, that I might do you service	 So good as you have done. 

ALL THE SERVITORS The gods forbid! 

ANTONY Well, my good fellows, wait on me tonight. Scant not my cups, and make as much of me As when mine empire was your fellow too	 And suffered my command. 

CLEOPATRA ,  <ACTION>aside to Enobarbus</ACTION> What does he mean? 

ENOBARBUS ,  <ACTION>aside to Cleopatra</ACTION> To make his followers weep. 

ANTONY ,  <ACTION>to the Servitors</ACTION> Tend me tonight; May be it is the period of your duty.	 Haply you shall not see me more, or if, A mangled shadow. Perchance tomorrow You’ll serve another master. I look on you As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends, I turn you not away, but, like a master	 Married to your good service, stay till death. Tend me tonight two hours—I ask no more— And the gods yield you for ’t! 

ENOBARBUS What mean you, sir, To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep,	 And I, an ass, am onion-eyed. For shame, Transform us not to women. 

ANTONY Ho, ho, ho! Now the witch take me if I meant it thus! Grace grow where those drops fall! My hearty	 friends, You take me in too dolorous a sense, For I spake to you for your comfort, did desire you To burn this night with torches. Know, my hearts, I hope well of tomorrow, and will lead you	 Where rather I’ll expect victorious life Than death and honor. Let’s to supper, come, And drown consideration. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
