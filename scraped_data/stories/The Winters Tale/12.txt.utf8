<ACTION>Enter Leontes, Cleomenes, Dion, Paulina, andServants.</ACTION> 

CLEOMENES Sir, you have done enough, and have performed A saintlike sorrow. No fault could you make Which you have not redeemed—indeed, paid down More penitence than done trespass. At the last, Do as the heavens have done: forget your evil;	 With them forgive yourself. 

LEONTES Whilst I remember Her and her virtues, I cannot forget My blemishes in them, and so still think of The wrong I did myself, which was so much	 That heirless it hath made my kingdom and Destroyed the sweet’st companion that e’er man Bred his hopes out of. 

PAULINA   True, too true, my lord. If one by one you wedded all the world,	 Or from the all that are took something good To make a perfect woman, she you killed Would be unparalleled. 

LEONTES I think so. Killed? She I killed? I did so, but thou strik’st me Sorely to say I did. It is as bitter Upon thy tongue as in my thought. Now, good now, Say so but seldom. 

CLEOMENES  Not at all, good lady. You might have spoken a thousand things that	 would Have done the time more benefit and graced Your kindness better. 

PAULINA   You are one of those Would have him wed again. 

DION If you would not so, You pity not the state nor the remembrance Of his most sovereign name, consider little What dangers by his Highness’ fail of issue May drop upon his kingdom and devour	 Incertain lookers-on. What were more holy Than to rejoice the former queen is well? What holier than, for royalty’s repair, For present comfort, and for future good, To bless the bed of majesty again With a sweet fellow to ’t? 

PAULINA There is none worthy, Respecting her that’s gone. Besides, the gods Will have fulfilled their secret purposes. For has not the divine Apollo said,	 Is ’t not the tenor of his oracle, That King Leontes shall not have an heir Till his lost child be found? Which that it shall Is all as monstrous to our human reason As my Antigonus to break his grave	 And come again to me—who, on my life, Did perish with the infant. ’Tis your counsel My lord should to the heavens be contrary, Oppose against their wills. Care not for issue. The crown will find an heir. Great Alexander	 Left his to th’ worthiest; so his successor Was like to be the best. 

LEONTES  Good Paulina, Who hast the memory of Hermione, I know, in honor, O, that ever I	 Had squared me to thy counsel! Then even now I might have looked upon my queen’s full eyes, Have taken treasure from her lips— 

PAULINA And left them More rich for what they yielded.	 

LEONTES Thou speak’st truth. No more such wives, therefore no wife. One worse, And better used, would make her sainted spirit Again possess her corpse, and on this stage, Where we offenders now appear, soul-vexed,	 And begin “Why to me?” 

PAULINA Had she such power, She had just cause. 

LEONTES She had, and would incense me To murder her I married.	 

PAULINA I should so. Were I the ghost that walked, I’d bid you mark Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in ’t You chose her. Then I’d shriek, that even your ears Should rift to hear me, and the words that followed	80 Should be “Remember mine.” 

LEONTES Stars, stars, And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife; I’ll have no wife, Paulina. 

PAULINA Will you swear Never to marry but by my free leave? 

LEONTES Never, Paulina, so be blest my spirit. 

PAULINA Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath. 

CLEOMENES You tempt him over-much. 

PAULINA   Unless another As like Hermione as is her picture Affront his eye. 

CLEOMENES Good madam— 

PAULINA I have done. Yet if my lord will marry—if you will, sir,	 No remedy but you will—give me the office To choose you a queen. She shall not be so young As was your former, but she shall be such As, walked your first queen’s ghost, it should take joy		 To see her in your arms. 

LEONTES My true Paulina, We shall not marry till thou bid’st us. 

PAULINA That Shall be when your first queen’s again in breath,	 Never till then. 

<ACTION>Enter a Servant.</ACTION> 

SERVANT One that gives out himself Prince Florizell, Son of Polixenes, with his princess—she The fairest I have yet beheld—desires access To your high presence.	 

LEONTES What with him? He comes not Like to his father’s greatness. His approach, So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us ’Tis not a visitation framed, but forced By need and accident. What train?	 

SERVANT But few, And those but mean. 

LEONTES His princess, say you, with him? 

SERVANT Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think, That e’er the sun shone bright on.	 

PAULINA  O Hermione, As every present time doth boast itself Above a better gone, so must thy grave Give way to what’s seen now. To Servant. Sir, you yourself	 Have said and writ so—but your writing now Is colder than that theme—she had not been Nor was not to be equalled. Thus your verse Flowed with her beauty once. ’Tis shrewdly ebbed To say you have seen a better.	 

SERVANT  Pardon, madam. The one I have almost forgot—your pardon; The other, when she has obtained your eye, Will have your tongue too. This is a creature, Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal	 Of all professors else, make proselytes Of who she but bid follow. 

PAULINA How, not women? 

SERVANT Women will love her that she is a woman More worth than any man; men, that she is	 The rarest of all women. 

LEONTES  Go, Cleomenes. Yourself, assisted with your honored friends, Bring them to our embracement. 

<ACTION>Cleomenes and others exit.</ACTION> 

Still, ’tis strange	 He thus should steal upon us. 

PAULINA Had our prince, Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had paired Well with this lord. There was not full a month Between their births.	 

LEONTES Prithee, no more; cease. Thou know’st He dies to me again when talked of. Sure, When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches Will bring me to consider that which may	 Unfurnish me of reason. They are come. 

<ACTION>Enter Florizell, Perdita, Cleomenes, and others.</ACTION> 

Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince, For she did print your royal father off, Conceiving you. Were I but twenty-one, Your father’s image is so hit in you,	 His very air, that I should call you brother, As I did him, and speak of something wildly By us performed before. Most dearly welcome, And your fair princess—goddess! O, alas, I lost a couple that ’twixt heaven and Earth	 Might thus have stood, begetting wonder, as You, gracious couple, do. And then I lost— All mine own folly—the society, Amity too, of your brave father, whom, Though bearing misery, I desire my life	 Once more to look on him. 

FLORIZELL   By his command Have I here touched Sicilia, and from him Give you all greetings that a king, at friend, Can send his brother. And but infirmity,	 Which waits upon worn times, hath something seized His wished ability, he had himself The lands and waters ’twixt your throne and his Measured to look upon you, whom he loves—	 He bade me say so—more than all the scepters And those that bear them living. 

LEONTES O my brother, Good gentleman, the wrongs I have done thee stir Afresh within me, and these thy offices,	 So rarely kind, are as interpreters Of my behindhand slackness. Welcome hither, As is the spring to th’ earth. And hath he too Exposed this paragon to th’ fearful usage, At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,	 To greet a man not worth her pains, much less Th’ adventure of her person? 

FLORIZELL  Good my lord, She came from Libya. 

LEONTES Where the warlike Smalus,	 That noble honored lord, is feared and loved? 

FLORIZELL Most royal sir, from thence, from him, whose daughter His tears proclaimed his, parting with her. Thence, A prosperous south wind friendly, we have crossed	 To execute the charge my father gave me For visiting your Highness. My best train I have from your Sicilian shores dismissed, Who for Bohemia bend, to signify Not only my success in Libya, sir,	 But my arrival and my wife’s in safety Here where we are. 

LEONTES  The blessèd gods Purge all infection from our air whilst you Do climate here! You have a holy father,	 A graceful gentleman, against whose person, So sacred as it is, I have done sin, For which the heavens, taking angry note, Have left me issueless. And your father’s blest, As he from heaven merits it, with you,	 Worthy his goodness. What might I have been Might I a son and daughter now have looked on, Such goodly things as you? 

<ACTION>Enter a Lord.</ACTION> 

LORD   Most noble sir, That which I shall report will bear no credit,	 Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir, Bohemia greets you from himself by me, Desires you to attach his son, who has— His dignity and duty both cast off— Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with	 A shepherd’s daughter. 

LEONTES Where’s Bohemia? Speak. 

LORD Here in your city. I now came from him. I speak amazedly, and it becomes My marvel and my message. To your court	 Whiles he was hast’ning—in the chase, it seems, Of this fair couple—meets he on the way The father of this seeming lady and Her brother, having both their country quitted With this young prince.	 

FLORIZELL Camillo has betrayed me, Whose honor and whose honesty till now Endured all weathers. 

LORD Lay ’t so to his charge. He’s with the King your father.	 

LEONTES Who? Camillo? 

LORD Camillo, sir. I spake with him, who now Has these poor men in question. Never saw I Wretches so quake. They kneel, they kiss the earth, Forswear themselves as often as they speak.	 Bohemia stops his ears and threatens them With divers deaths in death. 

PERDITA   O my poor father! The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have Our contract celebrated.	 

FLORIZELL We are not, sir, nor are we like to be. The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first. The odds for high and low’s alike. 

LEONTES My lord,	 Is this the daughter of a king? 

FLORIZELL  She is When once she is my wife. 

LEONTES That “once,” I see, by your good father’s speed Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,	 Most sorry, you have broken from his liking, Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty, That you might well enjoy her. 

FLORIZELL ,  <ACTION>to Perdita </ACTION> Dear, look up.	 Though Fortune, visible an enemy, Should chase us with my father, power no jot Hath she to change our loves.—Beseech you, sir, Remember since you owed no more to time Than I do now. With thought of such affections,	 Step forth mine advocate. At your request, My father will grant precious things as trifles. 

LEONTES Would he do so, I’d beg your precious mistress, Which he counts but a trifle. 

PAULINA Sir, my liege,	 Your eye hath too much youth in ’t. Not a month ’Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes Than what you look on now. 

LEONTES I thought of her	 Even in these looks I made.  <ACTION>To Florizell.</ACTION> But your petition Is yet unanswered. I will to your father. Your honor not o’erthrown by your desires, I am friend to them and you. Upon which errand	 I now go toward him. Therefore follow me, And mark what way I make. Come, good my lord.
