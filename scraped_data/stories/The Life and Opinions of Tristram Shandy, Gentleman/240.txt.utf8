Chapter 4.XXI. 

As I knew the geography of the Tomb of the Lovers, as well as if I had lived twenty years in Lyons, namely, that it was upon the turning of my right hand, just without the gate, leading to the Fauxbourg de Vaise--I dispatched Francois to the boat, that I might pay the homage I so long ow'd it, without a witness of my weakness--I walk'd with all imaginable joy towards the place--when I saw the gate which intercepted the tomb, my heart glowed within me-- 

--Tender and faithful spirits! cried I, addressing myself to Amandus and Amanda--long--long have I tarried to drop this tear upon your tomb--I come--I come-- 

When I came--there was no tomb to drop it upon. 

What would I have given for my uncle Toby, to have whistled Lillo bullero!
