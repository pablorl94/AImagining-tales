<ACTION>Enter Duke, disguised as a Friar, and Provost.</ACTION> 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> Hail to you, provost, so I think you are. 

PROVOST I am the Provost. What’s your will, good friar? 

DUKE ,  <ACTION>as Friar</ACTION> Bound by my charity and my blest order, I come to visit the afflicted spirits Here in the prison. Do me the common right	 To let me see them, and to make me know The nature of their crimes, that I may minister To them accordingly. 

PROVOST I would do more than that if more were needful. 

<ACTION>Enter Juliet.</ACTION> 

Look, here comes one, a gentlewoman of mine,	 Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth, Hath blistered her report. She is with child, And he that got it, sentenced—a young man, More fit to do another such offense Than die for this.	 

DUKE ,  <ACTION>as Friar</ACTION> When must he die? 

PROVOST  As I do think, tomorrow. <ACTION>To Juliet. </ACTION> I have provided for you. Stay awhile And you shall be conducted. 

DUKE ,  <ACTION>as Friar, to Juliet</ACTION> Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?	 

JULIET I do; and bear the shame most patiently. 

DUKE ,  <ACTION>as Friar</ACTION> I’ll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience, And try your penitence, if it be sound Or hollowly put on. 

JULIET I’ll gladly learn.	 

DUKE ,  <ACTION>as Friar</ACTION> Love you the man that wronged you? 

JULIET Yes, as I love the woman that wronged him. 

DUKE ,  <ACTION>as Friar</ACTION> So then it seems your most offenseful act Was mutually committed? 

JULIET Mutually.	 

DUKE ,  <ACTION>as Friar</ACTION> Then was your sin of heavier kind than his. 

JULIET I do confess it and repent it, father. 

DUKE , <ACTION> as Friar</ACTION> ’Tis meet so, daughter; but lest you do repent As that the sin hath brought you to this shame, Which sorrow is always toward ourselves, not	 heaven, Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it, But as we stand in fear— 

JULIET I do repent me as it is an evil, And take the shame with joy.	 

DUKE ,  <ACTION>as Friar</ACTION> There rest. Your partner, as I hear, must die tomorrow, And I am going with instruction to him. Grace go with you. Benedicite.	 

<ACTION>He exits.</ACTION> 

JULIET Must die tomorrow? O injurious love	 That respites me a life, whose very comfort Is still a dying horror. 

PROVOST  ’Tis pity of him. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
