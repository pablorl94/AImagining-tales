Phew. Now you've made it through Chapters 6 through 8 and have finally arrived at the final part of the prosecutor's closing statement.

Kirillovich describes the events at Mokroye. He depicts Dmitri as someone who thought his world had ended and his romantic hopes were dashed until he arrived at Mokroye. There, according to Kirillovich, he realized that he still had a chance with Grushenka. Reunited with her, his desire to live is rekindled. The reason the investigators found only 1,500 roubles on him is that he stashed the rest of the money in some secret hole at the inn.

Kirillovich claims that Dmitri's desire to live fuels his absurd stories during his interrogation at Mokroye. When confronted with the seemingly trivial but (to Kirillovich) damning detail that the gate to his father's house was open, Dmitri desperately came up with the fiction of the amulet and Smerdyakov's murdering his father.

Kirillovich then begs the jury to save Russia and convict Dmitri for the murder of his father.

His speech (finally) over, Kirillovich leaves the courtroom immediately and nearly faints in the next room. The chapter ends with chatter in the courtroom during a brief, twenty-minute break, before the defense attorney begins his speech.
