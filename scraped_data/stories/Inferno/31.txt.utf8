CANTO XXXII. 

Had I sonorous rough rhymes at command, Such as would suit the cavern terrible Rooted on which all the other ramparts stand, The sap of fancies which within me swell Closer I'd press; but since I have not these, With some misgiving I go on to tell. For 'tis no task to play with as you please, Of all the world the bottom to portray, Nor one that with a baby speech[797] agrees. But let those ladies help me with my lay                          10 Who helped Amphion[798] walls round Thebes to pile, And faithful to the facts my words shall stay. O 'bove all creatures wretched, for whose vile Abode 'tis hard to find a language fit, As sheep or goats ye had been happier! While We still were standing in the murky pit-- Beneath the giant's feet[799] set far below-- And at the high wall I was staring yet, When this I heard: 'Heed to thy steps[800] bestow, Lest haply by thy soles the heads be spurned                    20 Of wretched brothers wearied in their woe.' Before me, as on hearing this I turned, Beneath my feet a frozen lake,[801] its guise Rather of glass than water, I discerned. 

In all its course on Austrian Danube lies No veil in time of winter near so thick, Nor on the Don beneath its frigid skies, As this was here; on which if Tabernicch[802] Or Mount Pietrapana[803] should alight Not even the edge would answer with a creak.30 And as the croaking frog holds well in sight Its muzzle from the pool, what time of year[804] The peasant girl of gleaning dreams at night; The mourning shades in ice were covered here, Seen livid up to where we blush[805] with shame. In stork-like music their teeth chattering were. With downcast face stood every one of them: To cold from every mouth, and to despair From every eye, an ample witness came. And having somewhat gazed around me there                         40 I to my feet looked down, and saw two pressed So close together, tangled was their hair, 'Say, who are you with breast[806] thus strained to breast?' I asked; whereon their necks they backward bent, And when their upturned faces lay at rest Their eyes, which earlier were but moistened, sent Tears o'er their eyelids: these the frost congealed And fettered fast[807] before they further went. 

Plank set to plank no rivet ever held More firmly; wherefore, goat-like, either ghost                 50 Butted the other; so their wrath prevailed.And one who wanted both ears, which the frost Had bitten off, with face still downward thrown, Asked: 'Why with us art thou so long engrossed? If who that couple are thou'dst have made known-- The vale down which Bisenzio's floods decline Was once their father Albert's[808] and their own. One body bore them: search the whole malign Ca√Øna,[809] and thou shalt not any see More worthy to be fixed in gelatine;                            60 Not he whose breast and shadow equally Were by one thrust of Arthur's lance[810] pierced through: Nor yet Focaccia;[811] nor the one that me With his head hampers, blocking out my view, Whose name was Sassol Mascheroni:[812] well Thou must him know if thou art Tuscan too. And that thou need'st not make me further tell-- I'm Camicion de' Pazzi,[813] and Carlin[814] I weary for, whose guilt shall mine excel.' A thousand faces saw I dog-like grin,                             70 Frost-bound; whence I, as now, shall always shake Whenever sight of frozen pools I win. 

While to the centre[815] we our way did make To which all things converging gravitate, And me that chill eternal caused to quake; Whether by fortune, providence, or fate, I know not, but as 'mong the heads I went I kicked one full in the face; who therefore straight 'Why trample on me?'snarled and made lament, 'Unless thou com'st to heap the vengeance high                  80 For Montaperti,[816] why so virulent 'Gainst me?' I said: 'Await me here till I By him, O Master, shall be cleared of doubt;[817] Then let my pace thy will be guided by.' My Guide delayed, and I to him spake out, While he continued uttering curses shrill: 'Say, what art thou, at others thus to shout?' 'But who art thou, that goest at thy will Through Antenora,[818] trampling on the face Of others? 'Twere too much if thou wert still                   90 In life.' 'I live, and it may help thy case,' Was my reply, 'if thou renown wouldst gain, Should I thy name[819] upon my tablets place.' And he: 'I for the opposite am fain. 

Depart thou hence, nor work me further dool; Within this swamp thou flatterest all in vain.'Then I began him by the scalp to pull, And 'Thou must tell how thou art called,' I said, 'Or soon thy hair will not be plentiful.' And he: 'Though every hair thou from me shred                    100 I will not tell thee, nor my face turn round; No, though a thousand times thou spurn my head.' His locks ere this about my fist were wound, And many a tuft I tore, while dog-like wails Burst from him, and his eyes still sought the ground. Then called another: 'Bocca, what now ails? Is't not enough thy teeth go chattering there, But thou must bark? What devil thee assails?' 'Ah! now,' said I, 'thou need'st not aught declare, Accursed traitor; and true news of thee                        110 To thy disgrace I to the world will bear.' 'Begone, tell what thou wilt,' he answered me; 'But, if thou issue hence, not silent keep[820] Of him whose tongue but lately wagged so free. He for the Frenchmen's money[821] here doth weep. 

Him of Duera saw I, mayst thou tell, Where sinners shiver in the frozen deep.Shouldst thou be asked who else within it dwell-- Thou hast the Beccheria[822] at thy side; Across whose neck the knife at Florence fell. 120 John Soldanieri[823] may be yonder spied With Ganellon,[824] and Tribaldell[825] who threw Faenza's gates, when slept the city, wide.' Him had we left, our journey to pursue, When frozen in a hole[826] a pair I saw; One's head like the other's hat showed to the view. And, as their bread men hunger-driven gnaw, The uppermost tore fiercely at his mate Where nape and brain-pan to a junction draw. No worse by Tydeus[827] in his scornful hate                     130 Were Menalippus' temples gnawed and hacked Than skull and all were torn by him irate. 'O thou who provest by such bestial act Hatred of him who by thy teeth is chewed, Declare thy motive,' said I, 'on this pact-- That if with reason thou with him hast feud, Knowing your names and manner of his crime I in the world[828] to thee will make it good; If what I speak with dry not ere the time.'
