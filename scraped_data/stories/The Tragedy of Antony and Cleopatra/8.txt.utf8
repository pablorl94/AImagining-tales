LEPIDUS Trouble yourselves no further. Pray you hasten Your generals after. 

AGRIPPA Sir, Mark Antony Will e’en but kiss Octavia, and we’ll follow. 

LEPIDUS Till I shall see you in your soldiers’ dress,	 Which will become you both, farewell. 

MAECENAS  We shall, As I conceive the journey, be at the Mount Before you, Lepidus. 

LEPIDUS Your way is shorter;	 My purposes do draw me much about. You’ll win two days upon me. 

BOTH  Sir, good success. 

LEPIDUS Farewell.
