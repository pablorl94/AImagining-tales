<ACTION>Enter Cymbeline, Belarius as Morgan, Guiderius asPolydor, Arviragus as Cadwal, Pisanio, Attendants,and Lords.</ACTION> 

CYMBELINE ,  <ACTION>to Morgan, Polydor, and Cadwal</ACTION> Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart That the poor soldier that so richly fought, Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breast Stepped before targes of proof, cannot be found.	 He shall be happy that can find him, if Our grace can make him so. 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> I never saw Such noble fury in so poor a thing, Such precious deeds in one that promised naught	 But beggary and poor looks. 

CYMBELINE  No tidings of him? 

PISANIO He hath been searched among the dead and living, But no trace of him. 

CYMBELINE , <ACTION> to Morgan, Polydor, and Cadwal</ACTION> To my grief, I am	 The heir of his reward, which I will add To you, the liver, heart, and brain of Britain, By whom I grant she lives. ’Tis now the time To ask of whence you are. Report it. 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> Sir,	 In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen. Further to boast were neither true nor modest, Unless I add we are honest. 

CYMBELINE Bow your knees. 

<ACTION>They kneel. He taps their shoulders with his sword.</ACTION> 

Arise my knights o’ th’ battle. I create you	 Companions to our person, and will fit you With dignities becoming your estates.  

<ACTION>They rise.</ACTION> 

<ACTION>Enter Cornelius and Ladies.</ACTION> 

There’s business in these faces. Why so sadly Greet you our victory? You look like Romans, And not o’ th’ court of Britain.	 

CORNELIUS Hail, great king. To sour your happiness I must report The Queen is dead. 

CYMBELINE   Who worse than a physician Would this report become? But I consider	 By med’cine life may be prolonged, yet death Will seize the doctor too. How ended she? 

CORNELIUS With horror, madly dying, like her life, Which, being cruel to the world, concluded Most cruel to herself. What she confessed	 I will report, so please you. These her women Can trip me if I err, who with wet cheeks Were present when she finished. 

CYMBELINE Prithee, say. 

CORNELIUS First, she confessed she never loved you, only Affected greatness got by you, not you; Married your royalty, was wife to your place, Abhorred your person. 

CYMBELINE She alone knew this, And but she spoke it dying, I would not	 Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed. 

CORNELIUS Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love With such integrity, she did confess Was as a scorpion to her sight, whose life, But that her flight prevented it, she had	 Ta’en off by poison. 

CYMBELINE O, most delicate fiend! Who is ’t can read a woman? Is there more? 

CORNELIUS More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had For you a mortal mineral which, being took, Should by the minute feed on life and, ling’ring, By inches waste you. In which time she purposed, By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to O’ercome you with her show and, in time, When she had fitted you with her craft, to work	 Her son into th’ adoption of the crown; But failing of her end by his strange absence, Grew shameless desperate; opened, in despite Of heaven and men, her purposes; repented The evils she hatched were not effected; so	 Despairing died. 

CYMBELINE Heard you all this, her women? 

LADIES We did, so please your Highness. 

CYMBELINE  Mine eyes Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;	 Mine ears that heard her flattery; nor my heart, That thought her like her seeming. It had been vicious To have mistrusted her. Yet, O my daughter, That it was folly in me thou mayst say, And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all.	 

<ACTION>Enter Lucius, Iachimo, Soothsayer, and other Romanprisoners, Posthumus Leonatus behind, and Imogenas Fidele, with Briton Soldiers as guards.</ACTION> 

Thou com’st not, Caius, now for tribute. That The Britons have razed out, though with the loss Of many a bold one, whose kinsmen have made suit That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter Of you their captives, which ourself have granted.	 So think of your estate. 

LUCIUS Consider, sir, the chance of war. The day Was yours by accident. Had it gone with us, We should not, when the blood was cool, have threatened	 Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives May be called ransom, let it come. Sufficeth A Roman with a Roman’s heart can suffer. Augustus lives to think on ’t; and so much For my peculiar care. This one thing only I will entreat: my boy, a Briton born, Let him be ransomed. Never master had A page so kind, so duteous, diligent, So tender over his occasions, true,	 So feat, so nurselike. Let his virtue join With my request, which I’ll make bold your Highness Cannot deny. He hath done no Briton harm, Though he have served a Roman. Save him, sir, And spare no blood beside.	 

CYMBELINE I have surely seen him. His favor is familiar to me.—Boy, Thou hast looked thyself into my grace And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore, To say “Live, boy.” Ne’er thank thy master. Live,	 And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt, Fitting my bounty and thy state, I’ll give it, Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner, The noblest ta’en. 

IMOGEN ,  <ACTION>as Fidele</ACTION> I humbly thank your Highness.	 

LUCIUS I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad, And yet I know thou wilt. 

IMOGEN, <ACTION>as Fidele </ACTION> No, no, alack, There’s other work in hand. I see a thing Bitter to me as death. Your life, good master,	 Must shuffle for itself. 

LUCIUS The boy disdains me, He leaves me, scorns me. Briefly die their joys That place them on the truth of girls and boys. Why stands he so perplexed?	 

<ACTION>Imogen stares at Iachimo.</ACTION> 

CYMBELINE What would’st thou, boy? I love thee more and more. Think more and more What’s best to ask. Know’st him thou look’st on? Speak. Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? Thy friend?	 

IMOGEN ,  <ACTION>as Fidele</ACTION> He is a Roman, no more kin to me Than I to your Highness, who, being born your vassal, Am something nearer. 

CYMBELINE  Wherefore ey’st him so? 

IMOGEN ,  <ACTION>as Fidele</ACTION> I’ll tell you, sir, in private, if you please	 To give me hearing. 

CYMBELINE Ay, with all my heart, And lend my best attention. What’s thy name? 

IMOGEN ,  <ACTION>as Fidele</ACTION> Fidele, sir. 

CYMBELINE Thou ’rt my good youth, my page.	 I’ll be thy master. Walk with me. Speak freely. 

<ACTION>Cymbeline and Imogen walk aside and talk.</ACTION> 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> Is not this boy revived from death? 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> One sand another Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?	 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> The same dead thing alive. 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> Peace, peace. See further. He eyes us not. Forbear. Creatures may be alike. Were ’t he, I am sure He would have spoke to us. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> But we see him dead.	 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> Be silent. Let’s see further. 

PISANIO ,  <ACTION>aside</ACTION> It is my mistress! Since she is living, let the time run on To good or bad. 

<ACTION>Cymbeline and Imogen come forward.</ACTION> 

CYMBELINE ,  <ACTION>to Imogen </ACTION> Come, stand thou by our side.	 Make thy demand aloud.  <ACTION>(To Iachimo.) </ACTION> Sir, step you forth. Give answer to this boy, and do it freely, Or by our greatness and the grace of it, Which is our honor, bitter torture shall	 Winnow the truth from falsehood.—On. Speak to him. 

IMOGEN , <ACTION> as Fidele, pointing to Iachimo’s hand</ACTION> My boon is that this gentleman may render Of whom he had this ring. 

POSTHUMUS ,  <ACTION>aside </ACTION> What’s that to him?	 

CYMBELINE That diamond upon your finger, say How came it yours. 

IACHIMO Thou ’lt torture me to leave unspoken that Which to be spoke would torture thee. 

CYMBELINE How? Me?	 

IACHIMO I am glad to be constrained to utter that Which torments me to conceal. By villainy I got this ring. ’Twas Leonatus’ jewel, Whom thou didst banish, and—which more may grieve thee,	 As it doth me—a nobler sir ne’er lived ’Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord? 

CYMBELINE All that belongs to this. 

IACHIMO That paragon, thy daughter, For whom my heart drops blood and my false spirits	 Quail to remember—Give me leave; I faint. 

CYMBELINE My daughter? What of her? Renew thy strength. I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will Than die ere I hear more. Strive, man, and speak. 

IACHIMO Upon a time—unhappy was the clock	 That struck the hour!—it was in Rome—accursed The mansion where!—’twas at a feast—O, would Our viands had been poisoned, or at least Those which I heaved to head!—the good Posthumus—	 What should I say? He was too good to be Where ill men were, and was the best of all Amongst the rar’st of good ones—sitting sadly, Hearing us praise our loves of Italy For beauty that made barren the swelled boast	 Of him that best could speak; for feature, laming The shrine of Venus or straight-pight Minerva, Postures beyond brief nature; for condition, A shop of all the qualities that man Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,	 Fairness which strikes the eye— 

CYMBELINE I stand on fire. Come to the matter. 

IACHIMO All too soon I shall, Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,	 Most like a noble lord in love and one That had a royal lover, took his hint, And, not dispraising whom we praised—therein He was as calm as virtue—he began His mistress’ picture; which by his tongue being made And then a mind put in ’t, either our brags Were cracked of kitchen trulls, or his description Proved us unspeaking sots. 

CYMBELINE Nay, nay, to th’ purpose. 

IACHIMO Your daughter’s chastity—there it begins. He spake of her as Dian had hot dreams And she alone were cold; whereat I, wretch, Made scruple of his praise and wagered with him Pieces of gold ’gainst this, which then he wore Upon his honored finger, to attain In suit the place of ’s bed and win this ring By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight, No lesser of her honor confident Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring, And would so, had it been a carbuncle	 Of Phoebus’ wheel, and might so safely, had it Been all the worth of ’s car. Away to Britain Post I in this design. Well may you, sir, Remember me at court, where I was taught Of your chaste daughter the wide difference ’Twixt amorous and villainous. Being thus quenched Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain Gan in your duller Britain operate Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent. 

And to be brief, my practice so prevailed	 That I returned with simular proof enough To make the noble Leonatus mad By wounding his belief in her renown With tokens thus and thus; averring notes Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet— O, cunning how I got it!—nay, some marks Of secret on her person, that he could not But think her bond of chastity quite cracked, I having ta’en the forfeit.Whereupon— Methinks I see him now— 

POSTHUMUS ,  <ACTION>coming forward </ACTION> Ay, so thou dost, Italian fiend.—Ay me, most credulous fool, Egregious murderer, thief, anything That’s due to all the villains past, in being, To come. O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,	 Some upright justicer.—Thou, king, send out For torturers ingenious. It is I That all th’ abhorrèd things o’ th’ Earth amend By being worse than they. I am Posthumus, That killed thy daughter—villainlike, I lie—	 That caused a lesser villain than myself, A sacrilegious thief, to do ’t. The temple Of virtue was she, yea, and she herself. Spit and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set The dogs o’ th’ street to bay me. Every villain	 Be called Posthumus Leonatus, and Be villainy less than ’twas. O Imogen! My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen, Imogen, Imogen! 

IMOGEN ,  <ACTION>running to Posthumus</ACTION> Peace, my lord! 	  Hear, hear— 

POSTHUMUS Shall ’s have a play of this? Thou scornful page, There lie thy part.  

<ACTION>He pushes her away; she falls.</ACTION> 

PISANIO O, gentlemen, help!— Mine and your mistress! O my lord Posthumus,	 You ne’er killed Imogen till now! Help, help! Mine honored lady— 

CYMBELINE Does the world go round? 

POSTHUMUS How comes these staggers on me? 

PISANIO Wake, my mistress.	 

CYMBELINE If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me To death with mortal joy. 

PISANIO How fares my mistress? 

IMOGEN O, get thee from my sight! Thou gav’st me poison. Dangerous fellow, hence.	 Breathe not where princes are. 

CYMBELINE The tune of Imogen! 

PISANIO Lady, the gods throw stones of sulfur on me if That box I gave you was not thought by me A precious thing. I had it from the Queen.	 

CYMBELINE New matter still. 

IMOGEN It poisoned me. 

CORNELIUS O gods! <ACTION>To Pisanio.</ACTION> I left out one thing which the Queen confessed,	 Which must approve thee honest. “If Pisanio Have,” said she, “given his mistress that confection Which I gave him for cordial, she is served As I would serve a rat.” 

CYMBELINE What’s this, Cornelius?	 

CORNELIUS The Queen, sir, very oft importuned me To temper poisons for her, still pretending The satisfaction of her knowledge only In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs, Of no esteem. I, dreading that her purpose	 Was of more danger, did compound for her A certain stuff which, being ta’en, would cease The present power of life, but in short time All offices of nature should again Do their due functions.—Have you ta’en of it?	 

IMOGEN Most like I did, for I was dead. 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan, aside to Guiderius and Arviragus</ACTION> My boys, There was our error. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor  </ACTION> This is sure Fidele. 

IMOGEN, <ACTION>to Posthumus</ACTION> Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?	 Think that you are upon a rock, and now Throw me again.	 <ACTION>She embraces him.</ACTION> 

POSTHUMUS  Hang there like fruit, my soul, Till the tree die. 

CYMBELINE ,  <ACTION>to Imogen</ACTION> How now, my flesh, my child?	 What, mak’st thou me a dullard in this act? Wilt thou not speak to me? 

IMOGEN ,  <ACTION>kneeling  </ACTION> Your blessing, sir. 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan, aside to Guiderius and Arviragus</ACTION> Though you did love this youth, I blame you not. You had a motive for ’t.	 

CYMBELINE ,  <ACTION>to Imogen</ACTION> My tears that fall Prove holy water on thee. Imogen, Thy mother’s dead. 

IMOGEN I am sorry for ’t, my lord. <ACTION>She rises.</ACTION> 

CYMBELINE O, she was naught, and long of her it was	 That we meet here so strangely. But her son Is gone, we know not how nor where. 

PISANIO  My lord, Now fear is from me, I’ll speak truth. Lord Cloten, Upon my lady’s missing, came to me	 With his sword drawn, foamed at the mouth, and swore, If I discovered not which way she was gone, It was my instant death. By accident, I had a feignèd letter of my master’s	 Then in my pocket, which directed him To seek her on the mountains near to Milford; Where, in a frenzy, in my master’s garments, Which he enforced from me, away he posts With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate	 My lady’s honor. What became of him I further know not. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> Let me end the story. I slew him there. 

CYMBELINE Marry, the gods forfend!	 I would not thy good deeds should from my lips Pluck a hard sentence. Prithee, valiant youth, Deny ’t again. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> I have spoke it, and I did it. 

CYMBELINE He was a prince.	 

GUIDERIUS , <ACTION> as Polydor</ACTION> A most incivil one. The wrongs he did me Were nothing princelike, for he did provoke me With language that would make me spurn the sea If it could so roar to me. I cut off ’s head, And am right glad he is not standing here	 To tell this tale of mine. 

CYMBELINE I am sorrow for thee. By thine own tongue thou art condemned and must Endure our law. Thou ’rt dead. 

IMOGEN That headless man	 I thought had been my lord. 

CYMBELINE Bind the offender, And take him from our presence. Attendants bind Guiderius. 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> Stay, sir king. This man is better than the man he slew,	 As well descended as thyself, and hath More of thee merited than a band of Clotens Had ever scar for.—Let his arms alone. They were not born for bondage. 

CYMBELINE Why, old soldier,	 Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for By tasting of our wrath? How of descent As good as we? 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal</ACTION> In that he spake too far. 

CYMBELINE ,  <ACTION>to Morgan</ACTION> And thou shalt die for ’t.	 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan  </ACTION> We will die all three But I will prove that two on ’s are as good As I have given out him.—My sons, I must For mine own part unfold a dangerous speech, Though haply well for you.	 

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>as Cadwal  </ACTION> Your danger’s ours. 

GUIDERIUS ,  <ACTION>as Polydor</ACTION> And our good his. 

BELARIUS ,  <ACTION>as Morgan</ACTION> Have at it, then.—By leave, Thou hadst, great king, a subject who Was called Belarius.	 

CYMBELINE What of him? He is A banished traitor. 

BELARIUS   He it is that hath Assumed this age; indeed a banished man, I know not how a traitor.	 

CYMBELINE Take him hence. The whole world shall not save him. 

BELARIUS Not too hot. First pay me for the nursing of thy sons And let it be confiscate all, so soon	 As I have received it. 

CYMBELINE Nursing of my sons? 

BELARIUS I am too blunt and saucy. Here’s my knee. <ACTION>He kneels.</ACTION> Ere I arise I will prefer my sons, Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,	 These two young gentlemen that call me father And think they are my sons are none of mine. They are the issue of your loins, my liege, And blood of your begetting. 

CYMBELINE  How? My issue?	 

BELARIUS So sure as you your father’s. I, old Morgan, Am that Belarius whom you sometime banished. Your pleasure was my mere offense, my punishment Itself, and all my treason. That I suffered Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes—	 For such and so they are—these twenty years Have I trained up; those arts they have as I Could put into them. My breeding was, sir, as Your Highness knows. Their nurse Euriphile, Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children	 Upon my banishment. I moved her to ’t, Having received the punishment before For that which I did then. Beaten for loyalty Excited me to treason. Their dear loss, The more of you ’twas felt, the more it shaped	 Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir, Here are your sons again, and I must lose Two of the sweet’st companions in the world. The benediction of these covering heavens Fall on their heads like dew, for they are worthy	 To inlay heaven with stars.	 <ACTION>He weeps.</ACTION> 

CYMBELINE Thou weep’st and speak’st. The service that you three have done is more Unlike than this thou tell’st. I lost my children. If these be they, I know not how to wish	 A pair of worthier sons. 

BELARIUS Be pleased awhile. This gentleman whom I call Polydor, Most worthy prince, as yours is true Guiderius; This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,	 Your younger princely son. He, sir, was lapped In a most curious mantle, wrought by th’ hand Of his queen mother, which for more probation I can with ease produce. 

CYMBELINE Guiderius had	 Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star. It was a mark of wonder. 

BELARIUS This is he, Who hath upon him still that natural stamp. It was wise Nature’s end in the donation	 To be his evidence now. 

CYMBELINE  O, what am I, A mother to the birth of three? Ne’er mother Rejoiced deliverance more.—Blest pray you be, That after this strange starting from your orbs,	 You may reign in them now.—O Imogen, Thou hast lost by this a kingdom! 

IMOGEN  No, my lord. I have got two worlds by ’t.—O my gentle brothers, Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter	 But I am truest speaker. You called me “brother” When I was but your sister; I you “brothers” When we were so indeed. 

CYMBELINE Did you e’er meet? 

ARVIRAGUS Ay, my good lord.	 

GUIDERIUS And at first meeting loved, Continued so until we thought he died. 

CORNELIUS By the Queen’s dram she swallowed. 

CYMBELINE ,  <ACTION>to Imogen</ACTION> O, rare instinct! When shall I hear all through? This fierce	 abridgment Hath to it circumstantial branches which Distinction should be rich in. Where, how lived you? And when came you to serve our Roman captive? How parted with your brothers? How first met	 them? Why fled you from the court? And whither? To Belarius. These, And your three motives to the battle, with I know not how much more, should be demanded,	 And all the other by-dependences From chance to chance; but nor the time nor place Will serve our long interrogatories. See, Posthumus anchors upon Imogen; And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye	 On him, her brothers, me, her master, hitting Each object with a joy; the counterchange Is severally in all. Let’s quit this ground, And smoke the temple with our sacrifices. Thou art my brother, so we’ll hold thee ever.	 

IMOGEN, <ACTION>to Belarius</ACTION> You are my father too, and did relieve me To see this gracious season. 

CYMBELINE All o’erjoyed Save these in bonds; let them be joyful too, For they shall taste our comfort.	 

IMOGEN ,  <ACTION>to Lucius</ACTION> My good master, I will yet do you service. 

LUCIUS  Happy be you! 

CYMBELINE The forlorn soldier that so nobly fought, He would have well becomed this place and graced	 The thankings of a king. 

POSTHUMUS I am, sir, The soldier that did company these three In poor beseeming; ’twas a fitment for The purpose I then followed. That I was he,	 Speak, Iachimo. I had you down and might Have made you finish. 

IACHIMO ,  <ACTION>kneeling</ACTION> I am down again, But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee, As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,	 Which I so often owe; but your ring first, And here the bracelet of the truest princess That ever swore her faith. <ACTION>He holds out the ring and bracelet.</ACTION> 

POSTHUMUS Kneel not to me. The power that I have on you is to spare you;	 The malice towards you to forgive you. Live And deal with others better. 

CYMBELINE Nobly doomed. We’ll learn our freeness of a son-in-law: Pardon’s the word to all. 515 

<ACTION>Iachimo rises</ACTION> .  

ARVIRAGUS ,  <ACTION>to Posthumus</ACTION> You holp us, sir, As you did mean indeed to be our brother. Joyed are we that you are. 

POSTHUMUS Your servant, princes.—Good my lord of Rome, Call forth your soothsayer. As I slept, methought	 Great Jupiter upon his eagle backed Appeared to me, with other spritely shows Of mine own kindred. When I waked, I found This label on my bosom, whose containing Is so from sense in hardness that I can	 Make no collection of it. Let him show His skill in the construction. 

LUCIUS Philarmonus! 

SOOTHSAYER ,  <ACTION>coming forward</ACTION> Here, my good lord. 

LUCIUS  Read, and declare the meaning.	 

SOOTHSAYER  <ACTION>reads</ACTION> .  Whenas a lion’s whelp shall, to himself unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be lopped branches which, being dead many years, shall after revive, be jointed to the	 old stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty. Thou, Leonatus, art the lion’s whelp. The fit and apt construction of thy name,	 Being Leo-natus, doth import so much. <ACTION>To Cymbeline. </ACTION> The piece of tender air thy virtuous daughter, Which we call “mollis aer,” and “mollis aer” We term it “mulier,” which “mulier” I divine	 Is this most constant wife; who, even now, Answering the letter of the oracle, <ACTION>To Posthumus</ACTION> Unknown to you, unsought, were clipped about With this most tender air. 

CYMBELINE  This hath some seeming. 

SOOTHSAYER The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline, Personates thee; and thy lopped branches point Thy two sons forth, who, by Belarius stol’n, For many years thought dead, are now revived,	 To the majestic cedar joined, whose issue Promises Britain peace and plenty. 

CYMBELINE Well, My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius, Although the victor, we submit to Caesar	 And to the Roman Empire, promising To pay our wonted tribute, from the which We were dissuaded by our wicked queen, Whom heavens in justice both on her and hers Have laid most heavy hand. 

SOOTHSAYER The fingers of the powers above do tune The harmony of this peace. The vision Which I made known to Lucius ere the stroke Of this yet scarce-cold battle at this instant Is full accomplished. For the Roman eagle,	 From south to west on wing soaring aloft, Lessened herself and in the beams o’ th’ sun So vanished; which foreshowed our princely eagle, Th’ imperial Caesar, should again unite His favor with the radiant Cymbeline,	 Which shines here in the west. 

CYMBELINE  Laud we the gods, And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils From our blest altars. Publish we this peace To all our subjects. Set we forward. Let	 A Roman and a British ensign wave Friendly together. So through Lud’s Town march, And in the temple of great Jupiter Our peace we’ll ratify, seal it with feasts. Set on there. Never was a war did cease,	 Ere bloody hands were washed, with such a peace. 

<ACTION>They exit.</ACTION>
