<ACTION>Alarum. A retreat is sounded. Flourish. Enter, at onedoor, Cominius with the Romans; at another doorMartius, with his arm in a scarf.</ACTION> 

COMINIUS ,  <ACTION>to Martius </ACTION> If I should tell thee o’er this thy day’s work, Thou ’t not believe thy deeds. But I’ll report it Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles; Where great patricians shall attend and shrug, I’ th’ end admire; where ladies shall be frighted	 And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the dull tribunes, That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honors, Shall say against their hearts “We thank the gods Our Rome hath such a soldier.”	 Yet cam’st thou to a morsel of this feast, Having fully dined before. 

<ACTION>Enter Titus Lartius with his power, from the pursuit.</ACTION> 

LARTIUS O general, Here is the steed, we the caparison. Hadst thou beheld—	 

MARTIUS Pray now, no more. My mother, Who has a charter to extol her blood, When she does praise me grieves me. I have done As you have done—that’s what I can; Induced as you have been—that’s for my country.	 He that has but effected his good will Hath overta’en mine act. 

COMINIUS You shall not be The grave of your deserving. Rome must know The value of her own. ’Twere a concealment	 Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement, To hide your doings and to silence that Which, to the spire and top of praises vouched, Would seem but modest. Therefore, I beseech you— In sign of what you are, not to reward	 What you have done—before our army hear me. 

MARTIUS I have some wounds upon me, and they smart To hear themselves remembered. 

COMINIUS Should they not, Well might they fester ’gainst ingratitude	 And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses— Whereof we have ta’en good and good store—of all The treasure in this field achieved and city, We render you the tenth, to be ta’en forth Before the common distribution	 At your only choice. 

MARTIUS I thank you, general, But cannot make my heart consent to take A bribe to pay my sword. I do refuse it And stand upon my common part with those	 That have beheld the doing. 

<ACTION>A long flourish. They all cry “Martius, Martius!”and cast up their caps and lances.Cominius and Lartius stand bare.</ACTION> 

May these same instruments, which you profane, Never sound more! When drums and trumpets shall I’ th’ field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be Made all of false-faced soothing! When steel grows	 Soft as the parasite’s silk, let him be made An ovator for th’ wars! No more, I say. For that I have not washed my nose that bled, Or foiled some debile wretch—which, without note, Here’s many else have done—you shout me forth	 In acclamations hyperbolical, As if I loved my little should be dieted In praises sauced with lies. 

COMINIUS Too modest are you, More cruel to your good report than grateful	 To us that give you truly. By your patience, If ’gainst yourself you be incensed, we’ll put you, Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles, Then reason safely with you. Therefore be it known, As to us to all the world, that Caius Martius	 Wears this war’s garland, in token of the which My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him, With all his trim belonging. And from this time, For what he did before Corioles, call him, With all th’ applause and clamor of the host,	 Martius Caius Coriolanus! Bear Th’ addition nobly ever! 

<ACTION>Flourish. Trumpets sound, and drums.</ACTION> 

ALL Martius Caius Coriolanus! 

CORIOLANUS I will go wash; And when my face is fair, you shall perceive	 Whether I blush or no. Howbeit, I thank you. I mean to stride your steed and at all times To undercrest your good addition To th’ fairness of my power. 

COMINIUS So, to our tent,	 Where, ere we do repose us, we will write To Rome of our success.—You, Titus Lartius, Must to Corioles back. Send us to Rome The best, with whom we may articulate For their own good and ours.	 

LARTIUS I shall, my lord. 

CORIOLANUS The gods begin to mock me. I, that now Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg Of my lord general. 

COMINIUS Take ’t, ’tis yours. What is ’t?	 

CORIOLANUS I sometime lay here in Corioles At a poor man’s house; he used me kindly. He cried to me; I saw him prisoner; But then Aufidius was within my view, And wrath o’erwhelmed my pity. I request you	 To give my poor host freedom. 

COMINIUS O, well begged! Were he the butcher of my son, he should Be free as is the wind.—Deliver him, Titus. 

LARTIUS Martius, his name?	 

CORIOLANUS By Jupiter, forgot! I am weary; yea, my memory is tired. Have we no wine here? 

COMINIUS Go we to our tent. The blood upon your visage dries; ’tis time	 It should be looked to. Come. 

<ACTION>A flourish of cornets. They exit.</ACTION>
