This is a really unusually pointless anecdote about U.S. explorer David Porter and his ship the Essex.

His crew saw a ship, tried to catch it, and didn't.

But it was in the Enchanted Isles, so everything seemed mysterious andâ€¦enchanted.

Shmoop note: "The Encantadas" was the most popular piece in The Piazza Tales, initially. Go figure.
